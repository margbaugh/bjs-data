December 2012, NCJ 239808

During 2011, the number of prisoners under the jurisdiction 
of state and federal correctional authorities declined 
by 0.9%, from 1,613,803 to 1,598,780 (figure 1). 
This decline represented the second consecutive year the 
prison population in the United States decreased. At 
yearend 2011, 492 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S. 
residents were incarcerated, a decrease of 1.7% from the 
rate in 2010 (500 per 100,000). Both admissions into and 
releases from prison declined during 2011. Admissions of 
prisoners sentenced to more than one year in state or 
federal prison declined by 5.0% from 2010 to 2011, or 
nearly twice the rate of the decrease (down 2.9%) in 
releases of sentenced prisoners. 

The statistics in this report are drawn from the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National Prisoner Statistics 
(NPS) program, which collects annual data from all 50 
states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons on prisoner 
counts, characteristics, admissions, releases, and prison 
capacity. The 2011 NPS collection is number 87 in a series 
that began in 1925.

HIGHLIGHTS
************

* Declining for the second consecutive year, state and 
federal prison populations totaled 1,598,780 at yearend 
2011, a decrease of 0.9% (15,023 prisoners) from yearend 
2010.

* State correctional authorities had jurisdiction over 
21,663 fewer sentenced inmates in 2011 than in 2010. 
Seventy percent of this decrease was due to California’s 
Public Safety Realignment program.

* The number of state and federal prisoners sentenced to 
more than one year declined by 15,254 individuals, from 
1,552,669 in 2010 to 1,537,415 in 2011.

* The number of sentenced prisoners under the jurisdiction 
of the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 2011 increased by 
6,409 inmates (up 3.4%) from 2010.

* At yearend 2011, 492 out of every 100,000 U.S. residents 
were sentenced to more than one year in prison. 

* During 2011, the number of releases from state and 
federal prisons (688,384) exceeded the number of admissions 
(668,800).

* In 2010, 53% of prisoners incarcerated under state 
jurisdiction (725,000) were serving time for violent 
offenses. 

* Nearly half (48%) of inmates in federal prison were 
serving time for drug offenses in 2011, while slightly 
more than a third (35%) were incarcerated for public-order 
crimes. 

* At yearend 2011, 39% of sentenced state and federal 
prisoners were age 40 or older.

The decline of prisoners in California 
contributed to the overall prison 
population decline
**************************************

For the second year in a row, the number of prisoners 
under the jurisdiction of state and federal correctional 
authorities at yearend declined, as the U.S. prison 
population decreased by 0.9% in 2011 (table 1). The rate 
of decline during 2011 was larger than in 2010, when the 
prison population declined by 0.1%. From its peak in 2009 
of 1,615,487 prisoners, the U.S. prison population 
declined by 16,707 prisoners to reach 1,598,780 at yearend 
2011. 

The number of state prisoners decreased by 21,614 (down 
1.5%), while the federal prison population increased by 
6,591 (up 3.1%). This marked the second straight year in 
which the state prison population declined while the 
federal prison population increased. During 2011, the 
divergence in growth between state and federal prison 
populations was larger than in 2010, when the state prison 
population declined by 0.2% and the federal prison 
population increased by 0.8%.

Twenty-four states had increases in their prison 
population during 2011 (table 2). Among the 24 states and 
federal prison system with increases in their prison 
populations, the total increase amounted to 13,559 
prisoners. Tennessee and Kentucky each observed increases 
of more than 1,000 prisoners. In Illinois and Minnesota, 
the increase in 2011 was minimal (i.e., less than 10 
prisoners). 

In 2011, 26 states had decreases in their prison 
population totaling 28,582 prisoners. California’s decline 
of 15,493 prisoners accounted for more than half of the 
total decrease (see text box on page 4). New Jersey, New 
York, Michigan, Florida, and Texas had decreases of more 
than 1,000 prisoners, and Connecticut and North Carolina 
had declines of more than 900. 

California’s prison population declined by 9.4% in 2011, 
which was the largest percent change among the 51 
jurisdictions. New Hampshire (5.3%), Connecticut (5.2%), 
and New Jersey (4.7%) experienced declines of about 5%. 

In several states, prison populations declined during 2011 
after increasing during 2010. The prison population in 
Iowa declined by 3.6% in 2011 after increasing by 7.3% in 
2010. In Arkansas, the prison population declined by 0.6% 
in 2011 after increasing by 6.5% in 2010. In comparison, 
the prison population in Kentucky increased 4.9% in 2011, 
which offset the 5.1% decline in 2010.

*************************************
California Public Safety Realignment
*************************************

On May 23, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ruling by a lower 
three-judge court that the State of California must reduce its prison 
population to 137.5% of design capacity (approximately 110,000 prisoners) 
within two years to alleviate overcrowding. In response, the California 
State Legislature and governor enacted two laws—AB 109 and AB 117—to 
reduce the number of inmates housed in state prisons starting October 1, 
2011. 

The Public Safety Realignment (PSR) policy is designed to reduce the 
prison population through normal attrition of the existing population 
while placing new nonviolent, nonserious, nonsexual offenders under 
county jurisdiction for incarceration in local jail facilities. Inmates 
released from local jails will be placed under a county-directed post-
release community supervision program (PRCS) instead of the state’s 
parole system. The state is giving additional funding to the 58 counties 
in California to deal with the increased correctional population and 
responsibility, but each county must develop a plan for custody and post-
custody that best serves the needs of the county.

Since California incarcerates more individuals than any other state 
except Texas (10.8% of the U.S. state prison population), changes 
California’s prison population will have national implications. In 2011, 
the sentenced U.S. state prison population decreased by 21,663 inmates. 
California contributed 15,188 inmates (70%) to the total decrease. On 
December 31, 2010, California reported a total jurisdictional population 
of 165,062. On the same day in 2011, the population was 149,569. Between 
2010 and 2011, the number of sentenced female inmates in the California 
state prison population decreased at a faster rate (down 17.5%) than did 
males (down 8.7%).

A total of 96,669 inmates were admitted to California state prisons 
during 2011. Admissions during the first three quarters of 2011 accounted 
for 89% (about 86,000) of all state prison admissions, compared to 11% 
(about 10,600)during the fourth quarter (figure 2). Fourth quarter 
releases also declined from 25% in 2010 to 21% in 2011, and the types of 
release changed significantly. During the first three quarters of 2011, 
98% of releases were conditional mandatory releases to parole, compared 
to 1.5% for unconditional releases due to expiration of prison sentences 
(not shown). In quarter 4, only 46% of releases were conditional, while 
52% were unconditional without post-release stipulations. Overall, 
unconditional releases increased by 691% from 2010 to 2011, while 
conditional releases decreased 20% (table 3). All types of admissions to 
California state prisons decreased in 2011, with readmissions of parole 
violators down 22%.

The offense distribution of admissions to California state prisons 
changed after October 1, 2011 (table 4). The percentage of inmates 
admitted for violent offenses increased from 30% on September 30, 2011, 
to 41% on December 31, 2011. Decreases in property and drug offenders 
contributed to the change.

BJS will continue to monitor the change in the California state prison 
population, including the demographic and criminal characteristics, as 
low-level offenders are diverted from state prison to incarceration in 
local facilities. The California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation publishes weekly updates on the progress of PSR on their 
website:

*************************************
Imprisonment rates declined to levels 
last seen in 2005
*************************************

Prison systems are combined prison-jail systems in six states: Alaska, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. In these 
states, the prison population includes jail inmates, who are typically 
unsentenced and awaiting trial. In other states, prisons may hold a small 
number of unsentenced prisoners. To enable better comparisons between 
imprisonment rates and compositional changes across jurisdictions, BJS 
reports the number of sentenced prisoners (i.e., the number of prisoners 
with sentences of more than one year). At yearend 2011, there were 
1,537,415 prisoners serving sentences of more than one year, about 15,000 
fewer than at yearend 2010 (table 5).

Since sentenced prisoners made up 96% of the prison population in 2011, 
it was expected that the changes in the sentenced prison population in 
2011 mirrored those in the total prison population. The total number of 
sentenced prisoners declined by 1.0%, and the sentenced prison population 
in the federal system increased by 3.4%. The sentenced state prison 
population declined by 1.6%.

Between 2010 and 2011, the imprisonment rate--the number of sentenced 
prisoners divided by the U.S. resident population times 100,000—declined 
from 500 to 492 per 100,000 U.S. residents (table 6). The imprisonment 
rate has declined consistently since 2007 when there were 506 persons 
imprisoned per 100,000 U.S. residents. The rate in 2011 was comparable to 
the rate observed in 2005 (492 per 100,000).

Males (932 per 100,000) were imprisoned at 14 times the rate of females 
(65 per 100,000) in 2011. Imprisonment rates for males (down 1.7%) and 
females (down 1.8%) showed similar rates of decline from 2010 to 2011.

Imprisonment rates among the states ranged from 147 to 865 per 100,000 
residents (appendix table 3). Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and Rhode 
Island each had imprisonment rates below 200 per 100,000 residents of the 
individual states. Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama had rates at or 
above 650 per 100,000 residents. Rhode Island, New York, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Delaware, New Jersey, and Michigan imprisoned males at 
more than 20 times the rate of females.

Females comprised 6.7% of the 2011 state and federal prisoner population 
(appendix table 5). In eight states, at least 10% of the sentenced state 
prison population was female, including South Dakota, Idaho, Kentucky, 
Montana, West Virginia, Wyoming, Alaska, and North Dakota. Rhode Island, 
North Dakota, California, and New Hampshire had the greatest decreases in 
female prisoners between 2010 and 2011, declining between 15% and 24%. 
The female prison population increased by at least 14% in Alaska, 
Kentucky, and Tennessee.

*************************************
Black and Hispanic prisoners were 
generally younger and imprisoned at 
higher rates than white prisoners
*************************************

About 61% of the sentenced prison population in 2011 was age 39 or 
younger (table 7). The age distribution varied among racial groups. Among 
males--who accounted for 93% of the sentenced prison population--black 
non-Hispanic and Hispanic prisoners were generally younger than white 
non-Hispanic prisoners. More than half (52%) of white male prisoners were 
age 39 or younger, compared to 63% of black and 68% of Hispanic male 
prisoners. About 60% of both white and black female prisoners were age 39 
or younger, compared to 67% of Hispanic female prisoners.

In 2011, imprisonment rates among age and racial groups tended to 
increase through age 34 before declining (table 8). The imprisonment 
rates indicate that about 0.5% of all white males, more than 3.0% of all 
black males, and 1.2% of all Hispanic males were imprisoned in 2011. 
Between 6.6% and 7.5% of all black males ages 25 to 39 were imprisoned in 
2011, which were the highest imprisonment rates among the measured sex, 
race, Hispanic origin, and age groups. Slightly fewer than 3% of Hispanic 
males were imprisoned in each of the age cohorts between ages 25 and 39.
 
In 2011, blacks and Hispanics were imprisoned at higher rates than whites 
in all age groups for both male and female inmates. Among prisoners ages 
18 to 19, black males were imprisoned at more than 9 times the rate of 
white males. In 2011, Hispanic and black male prisoners age 65 or older 
were imprisoned at rates between 3 and 5 times those of white males. 
Excluding the youngest and oldest age groups, black males were imprisoned 
at rates that ranged between 5 and 7 times the rates of white males. 
Among persons ages 20 to 24, black males were imprisoned at about 7 times 
that of white males. Among persons ages 60 to 64, the black male 
imprisonment rate was 5 times that of the white male imprisonment rate. 
In comparison, Hispanic males were imprisoned at 2 to 3 times the rate of 
white males in 2011. Black females were imprisoned at between 2 and 3 
times the rate of white females, while Hispanic females were imprisoned 
at between 1 and 3 times the rate of white females.

*************************************
Violent offenders accounted for the 
majority of sentenced prisoners 
in state prison
*************************************

Of the nearly 1.4 million sentenced state prisoners, an estimated 725,000 
(53%) were sentenced for violent offenses in 2010, the year for which the 
most recent data on offense are available (table 9). Eighteen percent 
(249,500) of state prisoners were serving sentences for property 
offenses, and 17% (237,000) were serving sentences for drug crimes. An 
estimated 188,200 sentenced prisoners (14%) were serving time for murder 
or manslaughter (negligent and nonnegligent), while 160,800 prisoners 
(12%) were held for sexual assault crimes, including rape.

At yearend 2010, male and female state prison inmates differed in the 
types of offenses for which they were sentenced. At yearend 2010, 25% of 
female inmates in state prisons were incarcerated for drug crimes, 
compared to 17% of male inmates. Property crimes comprised 29% of the 
overall sentenced female population in state prison and 18% of the 
overall male population. An estimated 37% (34,100) of females in state 
prison were held for violent crimes, compared to 54% (689,000) of males. 
The percentage of females serving time for murder (10% of all sentenced 
females) was similar to that of males (12%). Robbery was the most common 
violent crime for males (14%), followed by murder (12%), and assault 
(11%).


A larger percentage of whites (24%) were sentenced for property crimes 
than Hispanics (14%) or blacks (15%). The percentage of Hispanics (57%) 
and blacks (55%) in state prison held on violent offenses exceeded that 
for whites (49%). A higher percentage of whites (16%) were imprisoned for 
both rape and other sexual assaults than blacks (8%) and Hispanics (12%)

*************************************
Violent offenders increased in state 
prison over the past decade, while 
drug offenders decreased
*************************************

From 2000 to 2010, the number of sentenced prisoners in state prisons 
increased by about 13% (152,898) (table 10). Over the same period, the 
share of violent offenders among sentenced prisoners in state prisons 
increased, while the shares of drug offenders decreased. Violent 
offenders increased both in numbers and proportion of the total state 
prison population. Between 2000 and 2010, the number of violent offenders 
increased by 99,400 (16%) as their share of the state sentenced prison 
population grew from 52% to 53%. The number of drug offenders declined by 
8% (down 21,100), and the number of property offenders remained 
relatively constant. The largest percent increase was among public order 
offenders (104% or 72,600 inmates). The majority of this increase was due 
to offenses categorized under habitual offender laws, in which the 
underlying offense or criminal history was not available.

*************************************
Drug and public-order offenses 
increased in federal prison
*************************************

The offense distribution for federal prisoners in 2011 differed from that 
of state prisoners in 2010, the most recent year for which data are 
available. Almost half of sentenced federal prisoners (48%) were held for 
drug crimes, while only 8% were held for violent offenses (table 11). 
Fewer inmates served time in federal prison for violent and drug crimes 
in 2011 than in 2010, while 35% of sentenced prisoners were imprisoned 
for public-order offenses. An estimated 11% (22,100) of inmates in 
federal prison were sentenced for immigration offenses, which represented 
one of the fastest growing segments of the federal prison population. 
Between 2010 and 2011, the number of inmates sentenced to more than a 
year in federal prison for immigration crimes increased 9.4%.

*************************************
Admissions and releases continued 
to decline in 2011
*************************************

Releases of sentenced federal or state prisoners exceeded admissions of 
sentenced prisoners during 2011, as both declined for the third year in a 
row. The 668,800 admissions into state or federal prison in 2011 was the 
lowest number of admissions since 2002 (table 12).

During 2011, sentenced prisoner admissions into and releases from state 
prisons decreased, while both admissions and releases increased in the 
federal prison system. The number of admissions into state prison 
(608,166) fell to its lowest level since 2001. New court commitments 
comprised 66% of state prison admissions in 2011, increasing from 63% in 
2010.

Inmates entering state prison on parole violations declined 12% between 
2010 and 2011. As was the case with the total state sentenced prison 
population, California was responsible for the majority of the reduction 
in parole violation admissions. California admitted 17,129 fewer inmates 
on parole violations in 2011 than in 2010, which accounted for 65% of the 
total state prison population decline in these admissions (appendix table 
13). 

In the federal prison system, new court commitments made up 92% of 
sentenced prison admissions, and increased 13% from 2010. In comparison, 
parole violation admissions increased 4.6% between 2010 and 2011.

There were 20,293 fewer releases from state and federal prison in 2011 
than in 2010. The majority (94%) of the reduction in releases was the 
result of fewer conditional releases (table 13). In state prison systems, 
75% of the 633,145 inmates released during 2011 had conditional releases, 
representing a 3.8% decrease from 493,287 conditional releases in 2010. 
The overall number of releases from federal prison increased in 2011. 
However, conditional releases--including supervised mandatory releases, 
discretionary parole, and shock probation releases--declined 33% between 
2010 and 2011 in the federal prison system. This decline was due to the 
declining number of federal prison inmates sentenced before the 
Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. Unconditional releases accounted for 98% 
of federal prison releases in 2011, an increase of 6.0% from 2010.

**************************
Other selected findings
**************************

* Eight jurisdictions had 2011 custody populations that exceeded by more 
than 137% their lowest reported prison capacity: Alabama, California, 
Illinois, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, North Dakota, and the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons (appendix table 14).

* Mississippi and New Mexico had custody populations occupying the least 
capacity. In 2011, Mississippi’s population was at only 45% of its 
operational capacity, while New Mexico was at 62% of its capacity.

* The percentage of all prisoners housed in private prison facilities 
increased slightly in 2011 from 7.9% to 8.2% (appendix table 15).

* The number of prisoners in private facilities under the jurisdiction of 
state Departments of Corrections decreased by 1.8% between 2010 and 2011. 

* The Federal Bureau of Prisons increased the number of inmates held in 
private prisons by 14% from 2010 to 2011.

* On December 31, 2011, 6.7% of the state and 18% of the federal prison 
populations were incarcerated in private facilities. 

* Texas (18,603 inmates) and Florida (11,827 inmates) had the highest 
number of inmates in private prisons. 

* North Carolina, Wisconsin, California, and Alabama each decreased the 
size of their private prison population by at least 45% from 2010 to 
2011. 

* Arizona, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and South Dakota incarcerated at 
least 17% more inmates in private facilities in 2011 than in 2010.

* In 2011, Louisiana incarcerated more than half (20,866) of its prison 
population in local jails, which represented 25% of all state and federal 
prisoners held in jails. 

* More than 50% of all prisoners housed in local jails in 2011 were 
serving time in Louisiana, Texas, or Tennessee. 

* Kentucky (33%), Tennessee (30%), Mississippi (28%), West Virginia 
(25%), and Utah (22%) also had large proportions of their prison 
populations incarcerated in local jails. 

* The total number of prison inmates housed in local jails decreased for 
both state and federal prison systems in 2011.

* Thirty-eight states reported holding a total of 1,790 inmates age 17 or 
younger on December 31, 2011. Of these, 96% were male (appendix table 
16).

* Florida, New York, and Louisiana held the most inmates age 17 or 
younger in 2011. These states imprisoned almost a third of the total 
number of inmates age 17 or younger.

* A total of 102,809 inmates identified as non-U.S. citizens were 
incarcerated at yearend 2011, an increase of 7.1% from 95,977 in 2010.

* In 2011, federal prisons had custody of 30% of all non-U.S. citizen 
inmates (30,544 prisoners), while California, Florida, and Texas 
incarcerated 35% (35,529 inmates) of non-U.S. citizens.

* Non-U.S. citizens represented 17% of the total custody population of 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 2011.

NPS jurisdiction notes 
***********************

Alabama--Alabama prisons have not currently been rated as to the official 
capacity. The operational capacity represents physical capacity for 
inmates, but is not based upon staffing, programs, and services.

Alaska--Prisons and jails form one integrated system, and NPS data 
include both jail and prison populations housed in state and out of 
state. Jurisdictional totals include individuals in electronic and 
special monitoring programs who are under the jurisdiction of the state 
of Alaska.

Arizona--Jurisdiction counts are based on custody counts and inmates in 
contracted beds.

California--Population counts for inmates with over 1 year maximum 
sentence(s) include felons who are temporarily absent, such as in court, 
jail, hospital, etc. Except for a small number, temporarily absent 
inmates are absent for less than 30 days. Population counts for 
unsentenced inmates include civil addicts who are temporarily absent for 
treatment but are typically returned to prison within 30 days. California 
is unable to differentiate between inmates held in federal facilities and 
in other states` facilities. Custody counts include California out-of-
state correctional facilities, community correctional facilities, private 
and private work furlough inmates, and inmates housed in out-of-state 
contract facilities. Changes in design capacity are based upon 
information from a report from facilities planning and management on an 
annual basis.

Colorado--Counts include a small undetermined number of inmates with a 
maximum sentence of 1 year or less. Data on admissions and releases by 
AWOL and escape are estimated. Population counts include 268 inmates in 
the Youthful Offender System, which is a program established primarily 
for violent juvenile offenders.

Connecticut--Prisons and jails form one integrated system, and NPS data 
include both jail and prison populations. New court commitment admissions 
include inmates admitted in 2011 on accused status, but who received a 
sentence later in 2011. Legislation in July 1995 abolished the capacity 
law. The capacity of a facility is a fluid number based upon the needs of 
the department. The needs are dictated by security issues, populations, 
court decrees, legal mandates, staffing and physical plant areas of 
facilities that are serving other purposes or have been decommissioned. 
The actual capacity of a facility is subject to change. 

Delaware--Prisons and jails form one integrated system, and NPS data 
include both jail and prison populations. Total jurisdiction counts 
include only those inmates housed in Delaware facilities. Capacity counts 
include the halfway houses under the Department of Corrections.

Federal Bureau of Prisons--Jurisdiction counts are as of December 25, 
2011, and include inmates housed in secure private facilities through 
private contracts and subcontracts, as well as inmates housed in 
jail/short-term detention and others held in state-operated secure 
facilities. They also include 8,770 inmates held in nonsecure privately 
operated residential reentry centers, as well as 2,427 offenders on home 
confinement. Due to information system configuration, Asian and Native 
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders are combined, and inmates of Hispanic 
origin are included in the racial categories. Expirations of sentence 
include good conduct releases that usually have a separate and distinct 
term of supervision, as well as vacated sentences and court ordered 
terminations. The Federal Bureau of Prisons does not house inmates age 17 
or younger in federal facilities; 149 such inmates were housed in 
contract facilities.

Georgia--Subtotals of race, sex, and sentence length for jurisdiction and 
custody counts were adjusted by the Georgia Department of Corrections 
using interpolation to match the overall totals.
Hawaii—Prisons and jails form one integrated system, and NPS data include 
both jail and prison populations. In custody and jurisdiction counts, 
sentenced felon probationers, and probation violators are included with 
the counts of a total maximum sentence of 1 year or less. Jurisdiction 
counts include dual jurisdiction (Hawaii/federal) inmates currently 
housed in federal facilities and in contracted beds. Hawaii does not have 
a rated capacity for the integrated prisons and jail system. Information 
on foreign nationals held in correctional facilities were based on self-
reports by inmates.

Idaho--Idaho defines rated capacity as 100% and operational capacity as 
95% of maxium capacity. Design capacity is based on original facility-
designed occupancy.

Illinois--All population counts are based on jurisdiction. Population 
counts for inmates with over 1 year maximum sentence include an 
undetermined number of inmates with a 1-year maximum sentence. Other 
release types include an undetermined number of transfers to other 
jurisdictions.

Iowa--Iowa began including offenders on work release, operating while 
intoxicated continuum status, and Iowa inmates housed in prisons out of 
state in jurisdiction counts in 2009. Prior Iowa data were custody counts 
only. Jurisdiction counts include Iowa offenders housed in prisons in 
other jurisdictions who are under Iowa’s jurisdiction. In 2011, Iowa 
began reporting escapee returns from residential facilities.

Kansas--The Asian category contains an undetermined number of Native 
Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders.

Kentucky--Capacity counts in Kentucky dropped significantly due to the 
closing of a minimum custody prison in 2011. The parole board in Kentucky 
is discretionary, and the parole rate can fluctuate on a year to year 
basis. The higher number of admissions of other conditional release 
violators without a new sentence is due to such a fluctuation. In 2011, 
the discretionary parole release program was expanded from 6 months to 9 
months.

Louisiana--Jurisdiction and capacity counts are as of December 28, 2011.

Maryland--Counts of inmates with sentences greater than 1 year on 
December 31, 2011, are calculated using the percentage of these inmates 
from the automated data on the manual totals. Maryland’s system does not 
distinguish between AWOL and escapee releases, nor does it record the sex 
of inmates housed in out-of-state private prisons. The count of 
admissions by new court commitments may include a small but undetermined 
number of returns from appeal or bond. The count of unconditional 
releases includes court-ordered releases and a small but undetermined 
number of releases to appeal or bond. Other release types include 
interstate compact releases and releases of new admissions that were 
double-counted on the admission side during 2011. Maryland’s system does 
not capture Hispanic ethnicity.

Massachusetts--By law, offenders in Massachusetts may be sentenced to 
terms of up to 2.5 years in locally operated jails and correctional 
institutions. This population is excluded from the state count, but is 
included in published population counts and rates for local jails and 
correctional institutions. Jurisdiction counts exclude approximately 
3,271 inmates in the county system (local jails and houses of correction) 
serving a sentence of over 1 year. Jurisdiction and custody counts may 
include a small but undetermined number of inmates who were remanded to 
court; transferred to the custody of another state, federal, or locally 
operated system; and subsequently released.

Michigan--Operational capacity includes institution and camp net 
operating capacities. Michigan’s new database system treats Hispanic as 
an ethnicity rather than a race. Since this is an optional field, the 
numbers for Hispanic race are significantly under reported.

Minnesota--Minnesota only measures operational capacity. Jurisdiction 
counts include inmates temporarily housed in local jails, on work 
release, or on community work crew programs. Admissions and releases due 
to AWOL or escape and releases due to transfer are not included in 
Minnesota’s database file.

Mississippi--Custody counts exclude county regional facilities, while 
jurisdiction counts include these facilities. Local jails and county 
regional facilities are included in the jurisdiction count of inmates 
housed at local facilities. Parole and conditional release violators are 
not distinguised in the Mississippi file by their sentence status.

Missouri--The Missouri Department of Corrections does not have the design 
capacity of its older prisons, nor does it update design capacity for 
prison extension or improvements. Missouri does not use a rated capacity. 
Missouri defines operational capacity as the number of available beds, 
including those temporarily offline. Noncitizen data are based on self-
reported place of birth.

Nebraska--By statute, inmates are housed where they are sentenced by the 
judge and are never housed in local jails or by another state in order to 
ease prison crowding. Nebraska defines operational capacity as its stress 
capacity, which is 125% of design capacity for designated facilities. 
This capacity is ordered by the governor, but set by the Department of 
Corrections. The total for design and operational capacity for female 
institutions includes only the department’s single female multicustody 
facility. The department operates two co-ed facilities, which are 
represented in male design and operational capacity counts.

Nevada--The Nevada Department of Corrections provided BJS with estimates 
for 2011 data. All data should be viewed as preliminary.

New Hampshire--New offender database management system reports the number 
of inmates under New Hampshire’s jurisdiction but housed in other states’ 
facilities in a different manner from previous NPS submissions.

New Jersey--Population counts for inmates with over 1 year maximum 
sentence include inmates with sentences of 1 year. The Department of 
Corrections has no jurisdiction over inmates with sentences of less than 
1 year or over unsentenced inmates. Rated capacity figures are not 
maintained. Operational and design capacity numbers do not include 
halfway houses and county jails. The numbers are only for the main 
institutions in New Jersey.

North Carolina--Rated capacity is not available. Captured escapees are 
not considered a prison admission type in North Carolina, and escape is 
not considered a type of prison release. Supervised mandatory releases 
are post-release offenders. Post-release supervision is defined as a 
reintegrative program for serious offenders who have served extensive 
prison terms. This form of supervision was created by the Structured 
Sentencing Act of 1993.

North Dakota--Capacities include a new facility that opened in 1998 and 
account for double bunking in the state penitentiary.

Ohio--Population counts for inmates with over 1 year maximum sentence 
include an undetermined number of inmates with a sentence of 1 year or 
less. Counts of inmates under Ohio’s jurisdiction but housed in federal 
or other states’ facilities are estimates. Counts of admission and 
release types reflect revised reporting methods. Returns and conditional 
releases involving transitional control inmates are reported only after 
movement from confinement to a terminal release status occurs.

Oklahoma--Inmates from other states serving time in Oklahoma prisons 
under the interstate compact are excluded from jurisdiction questions. 
Most of the inmates with sentences of less than 1 year are part of the 
Oklahoma Delayed Sentencing Program for Young Adults. Counts of prison 
release by escape reflect inmates escaping state-run prisons only. 
Capacity counts have changed in Oklahoma, as only Department of 
Corrections (DOC) facilities have an approved capacity determined by the 
Board of Corrections. Decreased capacity from last year’s report is due 
to the exclusion of county jails, private prisons, and halfway houses 
from 2011 data submission since they are not assigned capacities by the 
Oklahoma DOC. Noncitizen status determined by country of birth.

Oregon--Most offenders with less than 1 year maximum sentence remain 
under the control of local counties, rather than the Oregon Department of 
Corrections, and are not reported in this report. Oregon does not 
recognize rated capacity.

Pennsylvania--In 2011, a number of Pennsylvania inmates housed out of 
state were brought back to serve time in Pennsylvania. As of September 1, 
2011, the Department of Corrections changed operational bed capacity to 
bed capacity, which is defined as the number of inmates a facility can 
accommodate by filling all beds based on a number of factors: cell size; 
security level; and the number of inmates the facility can accommodate 
based on its staffing, support services, facility infrastructure, and 
full inmate employment or programming involvement. Bed capacity may 
include existing space conversions for permanent, new construction, and 
modular units if the above requirements are met. This is a change in how 
the department assesses capacity with respect to quality of life and 
safety for both staff and inmates as opposed to an operational change.
 
Rhode Island--Prisons and jails form one integrated system, and NPS data 
include both jail and prison populations. Rhode Island has opened two new 
women’s facilities over the past 2 years and closed one male medium 
security facility over the past 2 years, significantly changing the 
reported capacities. Counts for inmates under the jurisdiction of Rhode 
Island but housed in federal or other states’ facilities include inmates 
who have dual jurisdiction, or those serving Rhode Island sentences out 
of state while serving that state’s sentence as well. This is a change 
from previous reporting practices. The Rhode Island data system records 
Hispanic as a race rather than an ethnicity and does not capture Native 
Hawaiian/other Pacific Islanders or multiple races. Prison admissions 
classified as escape returns include admissions under home confinement, 
serving out of state, and minimum security facilities.

South Carolina--The December 31, 2011, custody count of unsentenced 
individuals includes Interstate Compact Commission (ICC) inmates. As of 
July 1, 2003, the South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC) began 
releasing inmates due for release and housed in SCDC institutions on the 
first day of each month. Since January 1, 2012, was a holiday, inmates 
eligible for release on January 1 were released on December 31, 2011. 
Therefore, the inmate count was at its lowest point for the month on 
December 31, 2011.

Conditional release counts include inmates released under community 
supervision after serving 85% of sentence under truth in sentencing. 
South Carolina utilizes the operational capacity concept in its 
management reports and other requested surveys.

South Dakota--Custody and jurisdiction counts of inmates serving a 
maximum sentence of 1 year or less include those under the sentence of 
probation who, as a condition of probation, must serve up to 180 days in 
state prison. The custody count of unsentenced inmates includes all holds 
for the U.S. Marshal Service (sentenced and unsentenced). Commutations 
are not tracked separately in the South Dakota reporting system. They are 
included in expiration of sentence, supervised mandatory release, or 
other conditional releases. The operational capacity reported is planned 
capacity. South Dakota does not have rated or design capacities.

Texas--Offenders in custody are all offenders currently serving time in a 
facility owned and operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice 
(TDCJ).Offenders under jurisdiction includes offenders in custody as well 
as offenders held in privately operated prisons, intermediate sanction 
facilities, substance abuse felony punishment facilities, pre-parole 
transfer facilities, and halfway houses; offenders temporarily released 
to a county less than 30 days; and offenders awaiting paperwork for 
transfer to state-funded custody. Capacities exclude county jail beds, 
because they do not have a minimum or maximum number of beds available 
for paper ready and bench warrant inmates. Admissions and releases 
include offenders received into an intermediate sanction facility, which 
is a sanction in lieu of revocation. These were counted in the parole 
violator category.

Vermont--Prisons and jails form one integrated system, and NPS data 
include both jail and prison populations. Ethnicity and multiracial 
composition are not collected/recorded in Vermont. 

Virginia--The reported jurisdiction counts are actual counts for December 
31, 2011. On September 1, 1998, the law changed, making state responsible 
inmates have a sentence of one year or more or a sentence of 12 months 
and one day. Inmates with a sentence of 12 months or less are not the 
responsibility of the state. The state is responsible for a 1-year 
sentence, while local authorities are responsible for a 12-month 
sentence. Virginia Department of Corrections maintains a count of beds--
called authorized capacity--that is provided as the measure of rated 
capacity in this survey. The number of beds assigned by rating officials 
(DOC) to institutions takes into account the number of inmates that can 
be accommodated based on staff, programs, services, and design. 

Washington--Offenders sentenced to 1 year or less and unsentenced 
offenders generally reside in county jails, but revisions to law allows 
certain inmates with sentences of less than 1 year to be housed in 
prison. These inmates are included in the total jurisdiction counts. 

Wisconsin--Custody and jurisdiction counts include 722 temporary 
probation and parole placements. Wisconsin does not code escapes as 
releases and returns from the escape as admissions. The reported design 
capacity include a Department of Corrections juvenile facility, a non-
Department of Corrections facility, and 97 beds in 20 Wisconsin county 
jails contracted to temporarily house Corrections inmates. Excluded from 
the total are design capacities for local jails, federal, other state and 
private facilities. From the end of 2010 to the end of 2011, the custody 
population increased, while the jurisdiction remained largely unchanged. 
This was possibly due to a decision to end a practice of early release to 
community supervision for some inmates begun in 2010, as well as a 
further reduction of inmates being held in out-of-state facilities. 
During 2011, a minimum male facility was converted to medium to handle 
increased custody population.

**************
Methodology
**************

Begun in 1926 under a mandate from Congress, the National Prisoner 
Statistics (NPS) program collects annual statistics on prisoners at 
yearend. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) sponsors the survey, and 
the U.S. Census Bureau serves as the data collection agent. BJS depends 
entirely on the voluntary participation of state departments of 
corrections and the Federal Bureau of Prisons for NPS data.

The NPS distinguishes between prisoners in custody and prisoners under 
jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a state or federal prison 
must hold that inmate in one of its facilities. Jurisdiction over a 
prisoner means state or federal officials have legal authority over that 
prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is incarcerated or supervised. 
Some states are unable to provide counts that distinguish between custody 
and jurisdiction. (See NPS jurisdiction notes to determine which states 
did not distinguish between custody and jurisdiction counts.)

The NPS jurisdiction counts include persons held in prisons, 
penitentiaries, correctional facilities, halfway houses, boot camps, 
farms, training or treatment centers, and hospitals. Counts also include 
prisoners who are--

* temporarily absent (less than 30 days), out to court, or on work 
release

* housed in privately operated facilities, local jails, or other state or 
federal facilities, or those serving concurrent sentences for more than 
one correctional authority.

The NPS custody counts include all inmates held within a state’s 
facilities, including inmates housed for other states. The custody counts 
exclude inmates held in local jails and in other jurisdictions. With a 
few exceptions, the final custody counts reported by BJS include inmates 
held in privately operated facilities.

In the fielding of a current year’s NPS survey, respondents are permitted 
to update the prior counts of prisoners held in custody and under 
jurisdiction. Statistics on the jurisdiction and sentenced prison 
populations for the prior year are updated in this report. All tables 
showing data based on jurisdiction counts--including tables of 
imprisonment rates—are based on the updated and most recently available 
data provided by respondents. 

The NPS has historically included counts of inmates in the combined jail-
prison systems of Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, 
and Vermont. The District of Columbia (D.C.) has not operated a prison 
system since yearend 2001. Felons sentenced under the D.C. criminal code 
are housed in federal facilities. Jail inmates in D.C. are included in 
the Annual Survey of Jails. Some previously published prisoner counts and 
the percentage change in population include D.C. jail inmates for 2001, 
the last year of collection. 

Admissions include new court commitments, parole violator returns, and 
other conditional release violator returns; transfers from other 
jurisdictions; returns of prisoners absent without leave (AWOL), with or 
without a new sentence; escape returns, with or without a new sentence; 
returns from appeal or bond, and other admissions. For reporting 
purposes, BJS admission counts exclude transfers from other 
jurisdictions, AWOL returns, and escape returns.

Releases include unconditional releases (e.g., expirations of sentence or 
commutations), conditional releases (e.g., probations, supervised 
mandatory releases, or discretionary paroles), deaths, AWOLs, escapes 
from confinement, transfers to other jurisdictions, releases to appeal or 
bond, and other releases. For reporting purposes, BJS release counts 
exclude AWOLs, escapes, and transfers to other jurisdictions.

BJS allows respondents to update data they previously submitted. This 
report includes the most recently reported data for 2010 and 2011. 
Additional information about the NPS, including the data collection 
instrument, is available on the BJS website.

*************************************
Estimating imprisonment rates by age, 
sex, and race or Hispanic origin 
*************************************

Estimates of the total number of sentenced prisoners on December 31, 
2011, by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin were generated by creating 
separate totals for federal and state prisons. Each sex-race count was 
then multiplied by the ratio of the age category count within the sex-
race combination in the Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP) to the 
FJSP total count within the sex-race combination (e.g., FJSP 18 to 19 
year-old white males divided by FJSP white males). The resulting product 
yielded the FJSP-adjusted NPS counts for each sex-race combination by age 
group (e.g., 18 to 19 year-old white male prisoners in the federal prison 
system). State prison age distributions for NPS use a similar race-sex 
ratio adjustment, based on individual-level data from the National 
Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP).

National--level estimates of the number of state prisoners by race were 
based on adjusting NPS counts to comport with Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) definitions of race and ethnicity. OMB defines persons of 
Hispanic or Latino origin as a separate category. Race categories are 
defined exclusive of Hispanic origin. Not all NPS providers’ information 
systems categorize race and ethnicity in this way. BJS’ adjusts the NPS 
data on race and Hispanic origin by the ratio of the relative 
distribution of prisoners by race and Hispanic origin in self-report 
inmate surveys that use OMB categories for race to the relative 
distribution of prisoners by race and Hispanic origin in the NPS data. 
This ratio is calculated for the year(s) in which BJS has an inmate 
survey and NPS data. For this report, the 2004 Survey of Inmates in State 
Correctional Facilities was used to calculate this ratio. The ratio 
obtained by comparing the within-year relative distributions by race and 
Hispanic origin was then multiplied by the NPS distribution in a year to 
generate the estimate of persons by race and Hispanic origin. 

Age--specific imprisonment rates for each age-sex-race group were 
calculated by dividing the estimated number of sentenced prisoners within 
each age group by the estimated number of U.S. residents in each age 
group on January 1, 2012. The result was multiplied by 100,000 and 
rounded to the nearest whole number. Totals by sex include all prisoners 
and U.S. residents, regardless of race or Hispanic origin. Detailed race 
and Hispanic origin imprisonment rates exclude person.

*************************************
Estimating offense distribution in 
the state prison population
*************************************

BJS employs a ratio adjustment method to weight the individual-level race 
or sex-specific offense data from NCRP to the control totals obtained in 
the NPS data collection, thereby yielding a national offense distribution 
for state prisoners. Updated NPS control totals of sentenced state 
prisoners and racial distributions necessitated the reanalysis of state 
prison offense data from 2008 and 2009. The updated results for 2008 and 
2009 appear in appendix tables 7 through 10.

******************
Prison capacities
******************

State and federal correctional authorities provide three measures of 
their facilities’ capacity: design capacity, operational capacity, and 
rated capacity. Estimates of the prison populations as a percentage of 
capacity are based on a state or federal custody population. In general, 
state capacity and custody counts exclude inmates held in private 
facilities, although six states include prisoners held in private 
facilities as part of the capacity of their prison systems: Florida, 
Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Wisconsin. For these states, 
prison population as a percent of capacity includes private facilities.
