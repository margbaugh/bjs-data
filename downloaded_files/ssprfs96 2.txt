Background

This report is the second edition of the BJS document, *Survey of 
State Procedures Related to Firearm Sales.*  The first edition, 
released in May 1996 (NCJ-160763), described procedures related 
to presale firearm background checks in each of the 50 States as 
of April 1996.  This edition updates the earlier publication and 
describes the procedures and practices in effect at the end of
1996.


The document is prepared as part of the BJS Firearm Inquiry 
Statistics (FIST) project, a component of the BJS National
Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP).  The FIST project was
established in 1995 to collect data describing the impact of
presale firearm checks required under Federal or state law.  The
currently applicable interim provisions of the Brady Handgun
Violence Prevention Act (Brady Act), PL 103-159, prohibit sale
of a handgun by a Federal firearm licensee for a period of 5 days 
or until the licensee has been advised that, based on a background 
check, a prospective purchaser is not prohibited from purchase 
under either the Federal Gun Control Act or applicable 
State legislation.  After November 1998, when the permanent
provisions of the Brady Act are effective, instant background checks will be 
required prior to the sale of any firearm by a licensee. 

The Federal Gun Control Act prohibits sales to one who --
*  is a juvenile;
*  is a fugitive from justice;
*  is under indictment for, or has been convicted of, a crime 
   punishable by  imprisonment for more than 1 year;
*  is an unlawful user of a controlled substance;
*  has been adjudicated as a mental defective or 
   committed to a mental institution;
*  is an alien unlawfully in the United States;
*  was discharged from the armed forces under 
   dishonorable conditions;
*  has renounced U.S. citizenship;
*  is subject to a court order restraining him or her 
   from harassing, stalking, or threatening an 
   intimate partner or child; or 
*  is a person convicted of domestic violence.

Data collected under the FIST program are also included 
in BJS Bulletins.  The first Bulletin, **Presale Firearm 
Checks, NCJ-162787,** was released in February 1997 and 
described inquiries and rejections related to all firearm 
sales between February 1994 (the effective date of the Brady 
Act requirements) and June 1996.  A second BJS Bulletin, 
**Presale Handgun Checks 1996, NCJ-165704,** is being released 
simultaneously with this publication.  The latter Bulletin 
focuses only on inquiries and rejections related to attempted 
handgun sales during 1996.


BJS anticipates that the procedural information presented in 
this report will be used together with the statistical
information presented in the Bulletins to provide the user with a more
complete understanding of the impact of presale firearm check
requirements. 

Data for this report were collected from agencies designated by 
their respective States as authorized to perform record checks 
for handgun purchasers and to determine if applications are 
acceptable under the Brady Act, or, particularly in the case of 
Brady-alternative States, under applicable State legislation. 
For purposes of this report, these agencies are referred to as 
CLEOs (Chief Law Enforcement Officers).  Depending on the State, 
CLEOs may be either a single State agency servicing the entire 
State or one or more local agencies.  The status of the
reporting agency is described on the individual State summaries, and a
list of State contacts is in Appendix A.  


Descriptions of procedures, as reported in this report, and some 
statistical data presented in the Bulletins, were voluntarily 
provided on survey questionnaires.  BJS also provided States
with software for direct reporting of statistical information.  The
software, which was designed to minimize State burdens associated with
data collection, was used at the option of the State.  To ensure
accuracy, a copy of each State's summary in this publication was forwarded
to the State for review, and clarifying comments were used to
refine the summary.  The data were collected and collated by the Regional
Justice Information Service (REJIS), the BJS grantee for the FIST
Project. 


Consistent with confidentiality and privacy protection
procedures, no data were collected under the project in a form identifiable 
to any individual.  Additionally, the software provided to
assist States in submitting data contains a purging mechanism which 
destroys data in accordance with applicable Federal or State law.

The information provided for each State reflects data provided
by the State and may include procedures required under State as
well as Federal legislation.  In some cases, for example, States have 
imposed requirements which go beyond the baseline  requirements
of the Federal Brady Act.  With respect to the impact of State
restoration of handgun privileges, States or users are urged to contact the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF).

As noted in the individual State summaries or the Appendix
tables, the document describes procedures applicable to both handguns
and other firearms.  

Changes over time:  Changes in the number of inquiries/denials
and the rate of overall, or specific categories of, rejections may
reflect a variety of factors.  These include changes in State or Federal
law, revisions in State policy, changes in State organization, and
the status and availability of different categories of records.  The 
regular release of updated information in these BJS documents is 
intended to highlight such changes.  

The most significant change occurring during 1996 was the
amendment to the Federal Gun Control Act which prohibited sales to persons 
convicted of any felony or misdemeanor involving domestic
violence (the last item in the list of prohibitions noted on page v). 
This amendment, generally known as the "Lautenberg Amendment, was 
effective as of October 1996. 

The individual summaries include references to any information 
provided by the State about the extent to which the State has
been able to implement procedures to identify  convictions for
domestic violence.  States vary, reflecting differences in how much
relevant information can be readily identified in accessible databases. 
As noted in the summaries, some States were already conducting such
checks pursuant to State legislation, requiring that no new procedures
be adopted.  In light of the recency of the change and the wide
variety of difficulties associated with implementation, however, readers
are cautioned against forming conclusions based on the limited
information provided by the States in this area. 

Other changes, reflecting, for example, a revision to
definitions of domestic violence or the establishment of statewide CLEOs, are
noted in the individual summaries.
