Nearly 148 million applications for firearm
transfers or permits were subject to background checks from 
the inception of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act 
of 1993 on March 1, 1994, through December 31, 2012. During
this period, about 2.4 million applications (1.6%)were 
denied (table 1). In 2012, approximately 15.7  million 
applications were subject to background checks, and 192,000 
(1.2%) were denied, including about 88,000 denied by the FBI 
and about 104,000 denied by state and local agencies. 

Data in this report were obtained from the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics’ (BJS) Firearms Inquiry Statistics
(FIST) program. The FIST program collects information on 
firearm applications and denials and combines this 
information with the FBI’s National Instant Criminal 
Background Check System (NICS) transaction data to produce 
an estimated number of background checks for firearm 
transfers or permits since the inception of the Brady Act.

These statistical tables describe trends in background
check activities that occurred in 2012. Data include
the number of firearm transaction applications processed by 
the FBI and by state and local agencies, the number of 
applications denied, reasons for denial, and estimates of 
applications by state and by each type of approval system.

Summary findings
*******************

* Since the inception of the Brady Act on March 1,
1994, through December 31, 2012, nearly 148 million
applications for firearm transfers or permits were subject
to background checks. More than 2.4 million applications
(1.6%) were denied (table 1).

* There were 15.7 million applications for firearm transfers
in 2012, an increase of more than 5 million applications
since 2010.

* About 1.2% of the 15.7 million applications for firearm
transfers or permits in 2012 were denied—about 88,000
by the FBI and nearly 104,000 by state and local agencies
(table 2).

* Among state agencies, denial rates in 2012 were 2.3% for
purchase permits, 1.5% for instant checks, 1% for other
approvals, and 0.9% for exempt carry permits (table 3).

* Among local agencies, the denial rates in 2012 were 3.1%
for purchase permit checks and 1.2% for exempt carry
permit checks (table 4).

* A felony conviction (43%) was the most common reason
for the FBI to deny an application in 2012. A fugitive from
justice status (19%) was the second most common reason
(table 5).

* Among the 20 state agencies that reported reasons for
denial, a felony conviction (29%) was the most common
reason to deny an application in 2012. A state law
prohibition (21%) was the second most common reason.

* Excluding other prohibitions, of the approximately 300
local agencies that reported reasons for denial, a state law 
prohibition (20%) was the most common reason to deny
an application in 2012.

* Among all agencies that reported reasons for denials in
2012, denial of an application due to a felony conviction
or indictment accounted for approximately 43% of denials
(table 6).

* Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives
(ATF) field offices investigated 5,313 NICS denials that
were referred by the FBI in 2012 (table 7).

*******************
Background
*******************

The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 (Pub.
L. No. 103-159, 107 Stat.1536 (1993), codified as amended
at 18 U.S.C. § 921 et seq.) mandates that a criminal history 
background check be performed on any person who
attempts to purchase a firearm from a Federal Firearms
Licensee (FFL). The permanent provisions of the Brady
Act established the NICS, which is accessed by the FBI or a
state point of contact (POC) prior to transferring a 
firearm.

The NICS is a system comprising data on persons who are
prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm under
the Brady Act or under state law.

The Gun Control Act, 18 U.S.C. 922, prohibits transfer of a
firearm to a person who--

* is under indictment for, or has been convicted of, a crime
punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year

* is a fugitive from justice

* is an unlawful user of, or addicted to, a controlled
substance

* has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed
to a mental institution

* is an illegal alien or has been admitted to the United 
States under a nonimmigrant visa

* was dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces

* has renounced U.S. citizenship

* is subject to a court order restraining him or her from
harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner
or child

* has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic
violence

* is under age 18 for long guns or under age 21 for 
handguns.

An FFL contacts either the FBI or a state POC to determine
whether a prospective purchaser is prohibited from receiving 
a firearm. During 2012, the FBI conducted all NICS checks 
for 29 states and the District of Columbia. POC agencies, 
which may be statewide or local, conducted all NICS checks 
for 13 other states. In the remaining 8 states, POC agencies 
conducted NICS checks on handgun transfer applicants and the 
FBI conducted checks on long gun transfer applicants. 
Several states require an additional background check that 
does not access the NICS. State laws may require a check on 
a permit applicant or a person who seeks to receive a 
firearm from an unlicensed seller. For more information on 
the NICS, visit the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information 
Service (CJIS) website at http://www.fbi.gov/about-
us/cjis/nics.

BJS began the FIST program in 1995 to provide national
estimates of the total number of firearm applications
received and denied pursuant to the Brady Act and similar
state laws. The FIST project collects counts of firearm
transfers and permit checks conducted by state and local
agencies and combines this information with the FBI’s NICS
transaction data. In addition, FIST collects information on
reasons for denials, appeals of denials, and law enforcement 
actions the FBI and ATF have taken against denied persons.

****************************
Overview of the national 
firearm check system
****************************

About 1,300 federal, state, and local agencies conduct
background checks on persons who apply to purchase a
firearm or for a permit that may be used to make a purchase.

Prospective firearm applicants must either undergo a NICS
background check that has been requested by a dealer
or present a state permit that the ATF has qualified as an
alternative to the point-of-transfer check.

ATF-qualified permits are those tha--

* allow an applicant to possess, acquire, or carry a firearm

* were issued not more than 5 years earlier by the state
where the transfer is to take place, after an authorized
government official verified that possession of a firearm
by the applicant would not be a violation of law.

All permits issued since November 29, 1998, must have
included a NICS check. Many NICS-alternative permits
may be used for multiple purchases while valid. State laws
often provide that a permit will be revoked if the holder
is convicted of an offense or otherwise becomes ineligible
after receiving the permit. Prior to transferring a firearm
under the permanent Brady provisions, an FFL is required to
obtain a completed Firearm Transaction Record (ATF form
4473) from the applicant.

An FFL initiates a NICS check by contacting either the FBI
or the state POC. Most inquiries are initiated by telephone. 
In 2002 the FBI added E-Check to allow FFLs to request a 
check electronically. The FBI or state POC queries available 
federal, state, and local systems and notifies the FFL that 
the transfer may proceed, may not proceed, or must be 
delayed pending further review of the applicant’s record.

When an FFL initiates a NICS background check, a name
and descriptor search is conducted to identify any matching
records in three nationally held databases managed by the
FBI’s CJIS. The following databases are searched during the
background check process:

* The Interstate Identification Index (III) maintains 
subject criminal history records. As of December 31, 2012, 
the NICS accessed and searched 64,064,033 III records during 
a background check.

* The National Crime Information Center (NCIC) contains
data on persons who are the subjects of protection orders
or active criminal warrants, immigration violators, and
others. As of December 31, 2012, the NICS searched
5,181,766 NCIC records during a background check.

* The NICS Index, a database created specifically for the
NICS, collects and maintains information contributed
by federal, state, local, and tribal agencies pertaining to
persons prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm
pursuant to federal and state law. Typically, the records
maintained in the NICS Index are not available via the III
or the NCIC. As of December 31, 2012, the NICS Index
contained 8,323,931 records.

The relevant databases of the U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) are searched for non-U.S. citizens who
attempt to receive firearms in the United States. In 2012, 
the NICS Section and the POC states sent 112,381 such 
queries to ICE. From February 2002 to December 31, 2012, ICE 
conducted over 441,020 queries for the NICS. ***Footnote 1 
Additional information about the NICS background check 
process is detailed in the NICS 2012 Operations Report at 
http://www.fbi.gov/aboutus/
cjis/nics/reports/2012-operations-report***. 

An applicant who is denied may appeal to the FBI or the
POC. A denied person who submitted a false application
or has an outstanding warrant may be subject to arrest and
prosecution under federal or state laws.

****************************
State and local NICS 
participation
****************************

Each state government determines the extent of its
involvement in the NICS process.

Three levels of state involvement currently exist:

* A full POC requests a NICS check on all firearm transfers
originating in the state.

* A partial POC requests a NICS check on all handgun
transfers. FFLs in the state are required to contact the FBI 
for NICS checks for long gun transfers.

* The state does not maintain a POC. FFLs are required to
contact the FBI for NICS checks on all firearm transfers
originating in the state.

****************************
Other uses of the NICS
****************************

In addition to NICS background checks required by
the Brady Act, use of the NICS is limited to providing
information to federal, state, or local criminal justice
agencies in connection with the issuance of a firearm- or
explosives-related permit or license, or responding to an
inquiry from ATF in connection with a civil or criminal
law enforcement activity relating to federal firearms laws
(28 CFR § 25.6). Firearm-related permits include ATF 
qualified alternative permits and other permits issued by
state or local agencies. In addition to checks on new and
renewed applications, rechecks may be conducted on current
permit holders.

****************
Methodology
****************

Data used for this report are prepared by the Regional
Justice Information Service (REJIS) through a cooperative
agreement with the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) under
the Firearm Inquiry Statistics (FIST) program. The FIST
program collects information on background checks
for firearm transfers or permits from federal, state, and
local agencies.

FIST frame generation
***********************

State statutes determine which agencies conduct background
checks for a firearm permit or transfer. To generate the 
FIST sampling frame for the 2012 collection, REJIS, under 
the direction of BJS, used multiple data sources combined 
with a large known pool of past FIST responders. First, 
REJIS included over a third of local agencies from the 2010 
FIST frame that were known to have responded to the FIST 
survey at least once in the previous 3 years and had a 
verified status of conducting background checks for firearm 
transfers. REJIS used other data sources and resources to 
verify the frame, including the 2008 Census of State and 
Local Law Enforcement and a 2011 Originating Agency 
Identifier file oflaw enforcement agencies obtained from the 
FBI.

The 2012 FIST universe was composed of the following:

* 29 states and the District of Columbia rely on the FBI’s
NICS to conduct firearm background check activities for
handguns and long guns. In eight states, the FBI NICS
conducts checks for long guns only.

* 31 state agencies and the District of Columbia provide
complete statewide counts of applications for firearm
transfers or permits, denials of applications, and (when
reported) reasons for denial, appeals, and arrests for at
least one type of check.

* 1,247 local checking agencies in 11 states issue permits,
track applications and denials, or conduct background
checks for various types of firearm permit or transfer
systems. ***Footnote 2 The FIST program obtains data from 
local law enforcement agencies that conduct background 
checks and issue permits, as well as other types of local 
agencies that conduct these activities, such as probate 
courts (in Georgia) and county clerks or other types of 
administrative offices (in New York). In such cases, the 
agency surveyed may not actually conduct a background check 
but rather issue a permit or track a permit that was issued 
or a transfer check. For the FIST program, collecting 
application and denial data from agencies that conduct 
background checks and from agencies that issue permits is 
considered to be most accurate and sometimes the only means 
available to assess background check activity. Additionally, 
populations covered by local agencies(for basic NICS checks 
and permits, not including other types of checks and 
permits, such as separate state-level checks and ATF-exempt 
carry permits) account for only 7% of the total U.S. 
population***.

For the FIST program, it is important to distinguish between
local agencies that are authorized by statute to conduct
background checks and those that actually conduct the 
checks. Although in certain states local agencies are 
legally authorized to conduct background checks for firearm 
transfers or permits, these agencies are not required to do 
so. When developing the 2012 FIST frame, REJIS identified a 
few instances where a local agency (usually a municipal 
police department) that was legally authorized by state 
statute to conduct a background check had never actually 
conducted background check activities and was unlikely to 
ever do so. Instead, transfer and permit applicants
who might use such a local agency are directed to another
local authority (usually the county sheriff) with 
jurisdiction to conduct a transfer check or issue a permit. 
Agencies that did not conduct background check activities 
were considered to be out of scope for the 2012 data 
collection.

For the FIST data collection, BJS determined that eligible
agencies in the frame should be those that are authorized to
conduct and are known to conduct or maintain information on
background checks. Such agencies collect or maintain data on
the critical FIST data elements: applications, denials, and 
(when reported) the reasons for denial, appeals, and 
arrests. Agencies that only have delegated background check 
functions are considered out of scope because they do not 
actually conduct firearm background check activities nor 
track information on such activities, which are the critical 
data collection items on the survey. Smaller law enforcement 
agencies that had closed since the construction of the FIST 
frame were determined to be out of scope for the 2012 data 
collection.

FIST sample 
****************

The 2012 FIST survey was designed to provide state-level
estimates of background check activity. BJS produced a
national estimate of the number of applications for firearms
received and denied pursuant to the Brady Act by combining
data obtained from state agencies and local checking
agencies with FBI NICS transaction data obtained from the
FBI’s NICS section. ***Footnote 3 The FBI reports on NICS 
transaction data in its annual NICS Operations Report. The 
FBI tracks the number of applications and denials processed 
by the NICS system. However, the FBI only reports reasons 
for denials made by the NICS section and does not include 
reasons for denials issued at the state and local levels 
(information that FIST collects). In 2012, the FBI reported 
over 10.8 million state point of contact (POC) transactions 
in 2012 compared to the approximately 7 million that FIST 
reported. This variation can be attributed to several 
factors, notably within the category of state firearm 
permits. The FIST counts include applications for two types 
of state firearm permits: (1) permits required for a 
transfer (purchase permits) and (2) concealed carry permits
that may be used to exempt the holder from a background 
check at the time of transfer (exempt carry permits). At 
yearend 2012, 19 states had an exempt carry permit (Delaware 
had an exempt carry permit for only the first half of 2012).
Thirty other states had concealed carry permits in 2012 that 
were not exempt and were not included in FIST. At least some 
of those 30 states used NICS for checks on applicants, and 
those checks have been included in the FBI statistics.
The largest difference within the state firearm permit 
category was caused by periodic rechecks that at least two 
state agencies ran on all current carry permit holders. The 
rechecks were included in FBI transaction counts but not in 
FIST counts because they were not connected to a firearm 
transfer, and the state POC was able to separately report 
rechecks***.

REJIS collected state-level data from the state reporting
agencies via survey or extracted publically available
online reports from the state website. Except for one state
(Pennsylvania) in which denials were estimated, all data
collected by state agencies are considered to be complete
counts. To obtain FIST data in 2012, REJIS surveyed local
checking agencies in 11 states that operated local checking
agencies to conduct background check information.
Totals were estimated for states where the reporters were
local agencies.

Local agencies in 7 (Delaware, Idaho, Iowa, Montana, North
Carolina, Nevada, and New York) of the 11 states were
enumerated, and local agencies in 4 (Georgia, Minnesota,
Nebraska, and Washington) of the states were sampled
in 2 of the 4 sample strata due to the large number of
potential reporters. REJIS created a stratified random 
sample proportionate to state and stratum size in each of 
the 4 states sampled based on population size that roughly 
equates to--

* Stratum 1: rural—places of less than 10,000 population

* Stratum 2: small cities—places of between 10,000 and
99,999 population

* Stratum 3: small metropolitan areas—places of between
100,000 and 199,999 population

* Stratum 4: large metropolitan areas—places of 200,000 or
more population.

BJS created a reserve sample to account for potential low
response rates for the 2012 collection. In total, a 30% 
reserve sample was drawn for each of the four sampled 
states; it was split into two reserve samples yielding a 15% 
sample per reserve sample. Because all agencies in strata 3 
and 4 were surveyed, the reserve sample only impacted strata 
1 and 2 of the sampled agencies. The first reserve sample 
was to be used if one of the sampled states had a response 
rate of less than 80% for the initial data collection 
period. The second reserve sample was to be used if one of 
the sampled states had a response rate of less than 75% 
after the first reserve sample was collected. Both reserve 
samples were deployed for the 2012 FIST data collection.

The final designated sample included 405 enumerated 
(selfrepresenting or SR) local agencies and 489 sampled 
(nonself-representing or NSR) local agencies. After 
adjusting for agencies that were ineligible to participate 
in the survey, the final sample consisted of 868 state and 
local agencies. The overall response rate was 74%. All 
(100%) state agencies and 73% of local agencies responded to 
the survey (table 8).

BJS redesigned the FIST survey form and data collection
methodology for the 2012 collection. The survey form was
designed with input from survey methodologists, 
subjectmatter experts, and stakeholders in the law 
enforcement community. To minimize respondent burden, the 
form was changed to provide clearer instructions and to 
include screener questions that help respondents determine 
which questions pertain to their agency based on their 
background check responsibilities. To increase survey 
response, REJIS employed multiple survey modes (e.g., online 
form, paper survey, and fax) and a rigorous nonresponse 
follow-up contact strategy.

Because the FIST study was redesigned for the 2012
collection, comparisons with FIST data from previous years
should be made with caution.

Estimation
**************

Data obtained from state and local agencies were combined
with the FBI’s NICS transaction data to create an estimate 
of the total number of firearm transfer and permit 
applications received and denied nationally. REJIS applied 
design weights and nonresponse adjustment factors for 
enumerated and sampled local agencies to generate estimates 
of the number of applications and denials at the state 
level.

The 2012 FIST data collection provides for two basic
weighting structures for local respondent agencies: a weight
applied to SR agencies and a weight applied to NSR agencies.

SR agencies (enumerated) 
*************************

Each local checking agency within the seven states in which 
all known eligible agencies were contacted received a design 
weight of 1 (w1 = 1). In addition to the design weight, a 
nonresponse adjustment (w2) was applied to responding 
agencies to compensate for the agencies that did not 
respond.

NSR agencies (sampled)
************************

The process for calculating weights for NSR agencies was
similar to that for SR agencies, except these agencies (the
small agencies in strata 1 and 2 of the sampled states)
received a design weight of greater than 1 (w1 > 1) 
according to the population-based stratum and the state in 
which they reside. This weight reflects the inverse of the 
probability of selection for the state and stratum size 
(cell) in which the agency resides. Agencies in strata 3 and 
4 (large agencies) were selected with certainty and were 
therefore given a weight of 1. Weights were adjusted for any 
agencies that were out of scope in the sampled states.

Nonresponse adjustment
************************

The nonresponse adjustment accounts for agencies that
were ineligible (out of scope) and for nonrespondents. It
consists of a ratio adjustment of the sum of the weighted
eligible agencies (per state and population size stratum) to
the sum of weighted respondent agencies (also, per state and
population size stratum). A nonresponse adjustment was
applied to each cell (stratum within state) if there was any
nonresponse. This created a specific adjustment for each 
cell that applies to all states, whether enumerated or 
sampled.

Partial-year reporting adjustment
***********************************

A weight (w3), consisting of a small ratio adjustment to
account for missing months of data, was applied to adjust
for any agency that reported only partial-year data. This
adjustment to account missing months was necessary for
three local agencies.

Final weights
***************

The final weights (Fw) applied to each FIST case are
the product of a design weight applied to each agency,
a nonresponse adjustment weight, and the partial-year
reporting weight (Fw = w1 × w2 × w3).

Item nonresponse imputation 
for local agencies
*******************************

For the 2012 FIST collection, REJIS determined that there
were very few cases in which information on applications
for firearm transfers or permits was missing. There were
more cases of missing data for denials, but this was a small
number compared to other missing data (e.g., reasons for
denial). To count partial responses, agencies were required
to report either the number of applications received or the
number of denials issued. If neither was present, the agency
was considered a nonrespondent. Ten agencies provided
denials but not applications. Thirty-two agencies provided
the number of applications but not denials. In the instances
of missing data on applications or denials, REJIS used a
conditional mean imputation to estimate the number of
applications and denials.

To yield the most reliable estimates, REJIS replaced missing
values with the mean number of applications of other
agencies in the same state that were in the same population
category. In population stratum 1, this approach was
deemed sufficient because all agencies served a population
of less than 10,000. In population stratum 2, the population
size covered a broad range (10,000 to 99,999). As such, a
traditional group-mean replacement would have produced
unacceptably imprecise approximations. To address this,
for agencies with complete data REJIS employed a basic
multiple imputation strategy that took into account the
number of denials, the actual population size served, and 
the number of applications to calculate the estimated number
of applications in instances of missing data. The result was
a within-state and stratum group-based sum of imputed
values, but it was proportionate to the population 
allocation of imputed applications or denials per agency.

Estimates for 2011 data
**************************

BJS did not collect 2011 FIST data, primarily because of
the amount of time BJS and REJIS spent revising the FIST
methodology and the decision to prioritize the collection of
2012 data to obtain more recent data on firearm background
check activities. To account for the missing 2011 data in
the national estimate, REJIS calculated an estimate for the
total number of applications and denials at the state and
local levels by using the number of applications and denials
collected through FIST from 2000 through 2012 to create
a linear trend from which an estimate for the missing 2011
data was generated. The available observations were fit to a
least squares regression line to replace the missing values 
for 2011. This was done for both state and local agencies. 
When the estimates of applications and denials were 
completed, distributions of permit and check types from 2010 
were applied to the 2011 estimates to estimate the number of
applications and denials by permit and check  type. *** 
Footnote 4 From year to year, the distribution of check and 
permit types for state and local agencies’ applications and 
denials remained stable. In the instances where there was a 
difference of more than 3 percentage points in the
distribution of permits and checks, the average of the 2010 
and 2012 distributions of the relevant permit type was used 
to calculate a percentage of the total for that permit. In 
2012, this applied to purchase permit applications and 
exempt carry applications for local agencies***.


Adjustments to data
*********************

REJIS obtained concealed carry permit data from Michigan
by fiscal year, which were used to provide estimates for the
calendar year. Although 27 local agencies in Michigan were
sampled and surveyed to collect data on purchase permit
applications, Michigan was also able to report on the number
of purchase permit applications and was therefore counted
as a state agency reporter. In future data collection years,
Michigan will be considered a state agency reporter.

Pennsylvania reported 703,722 instant checks, which
are included in the FIST national estimate, and 269,696
applications for nonexempt licenses to carry. Pennsylvania
also provided the combined number of denials of all
applications, which was prorated to obtain the number of
denials of instant checks.

At the beginning of the 2012 FIST collection, local agencies
from Washington were expected to respond to survey
questions about point-of-transfer checks and exempt
concealed carry permits. During the data collection period,
REJIS discovered that even though ATF allows Washington’s
concealed carry permit—known within the state as a
concealed pistol license (CPL)—to exempt a purchaser from
a dealer NICS check, Washington state law still requires
a dealer to request a NICS check on a handgun applicant.
Consequently, Washington’s carry permit does not meet the
FIST survey’s criteria for being exempt, and some data that
were collected on concealed carry permits for Washington
could not be included in the FIST totals.

BJS added 1,546,512 applications for exempt carry permits to
the total number of FIST applications received from 2000 to
2010 after REJIS learned from the FBI that these 
applications were not counted in the FBI federal NICS totals 
for 9 states (Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Kentucky, 
Mississippi, North Dakota, South Carolina, Texas, and 
Wyoming) as had been the assumption. The addition of these 
applications had a negligible impact on the denial rates.

Standard errors
******************

Standard error calculations were computed for the estimates
of total applications, total denials and the ratio of 
denials to total applications for three types: purchase, 
transfer and concealed carry permits across states, and size 
of region for local agencies. The standard error 
computations take into account several aspects of the FIST 
design, including stratification of data collection by a 
combination of state and population served categories and 
finite population sampling (without replacement) across the 
states and population categories of interest. REJIS 
approximated the FIST design by generating 68 final strata 
defined as combinations of state and population categories. 
Data from SR agencies were treated as certainty samples with 
an initial selection probability of one. For these states 
and population category combinations, complete responses 
would have a negligible contribution to the overall standard 
errors for a given estimate. To account for this and the 
fact that finite population correction (FPC) factors for the 
samples generated by the FIST design were very small, FPCs 
were directly incorporated into the standard error 
computations. Finally, estimates for local agencies included 
one additional subdomain of agency type: local or state 
(centralized reporting). All computations were generated 
using the FIST final sampling weight which incorporated 
adjustments for missing values, nonresponse, and an overall 
population eligibility or coverage adjustment. In some 
cases, standard error computations were not possible as only 
one agency reported information from a given type of 
application in areas where more than one agency was queried 
(via sample or census). In these cases, no standard error 
computations were provided.

Reasons for denial
*******************

BJS has collected information about reasons for denial
since the FIST program’s inception in 1996. The FIST
survey includes 12 categories that reflect the most common
reasons for denial and closely match the categories of 
federal prohibitors. When an agency provided reasons for 
denial that did not match with an existing FIST denial 
category, REJIS determined which denial category best 
matched the reported reason and verified the classification 
with the responding agency.

In 2012, the FBI, 20 state agencies, and approximately 300
local agencies reported reasons for denials. There are two
major difficulties in reporting reasons for denial.

First, among reporting agencies there was a high degree of
nonresponse on items that asked about reasons for denial.
Among local agencies, nonresponse was high in most states
and population strata. Local agencies in two states 
(Delaware and New York) did not report any reasons for 
denial. In 2012, the FBI and some state agencies provided a 
reason for each denial. Other state agencies provided 
reasons only for some denials, and some state agencies did 
not provide any reasons for denials.

Second, the method by which agencies record or track
reasons for a denial varies among state and local agencies.
Approximately two-thirds of local agencies report all of
the reasons found on a background check that disqualify a
permit or transfer seeker from obtaining a firearm, while a
third of agencies report only one reason for a denial. Among
state agencies, this proportion is reversed with a third
reporting all reasons a permit or transfer was denied, while
two-thirds report only one reason. Finally, among some state
and local agencies that report one reason for a denial, some
report only the most serious charge listed on a background
check, others list the first reason found, and others do not
indicate the reason.

Due to the high nonresponse and variation in the way
reasons for denial are reported, a simple estimation for
the number of reasons for denial by local agencies was
calculated. Estimates used only the agency base weight,
rather than the final weight that was applied to all other
local agency estimates. (See Final weights section.) This 
was done to bring the representation of responses from 
sampled agencies in line with those from states in which a 
census of agencies was conducted. The FBI and state agency 
reasons for denial counts are reported, and no estimation on 
these counts was conducted.

Appeals and arrests
***********************

BJS has collected information on appeals and arrests since
2000. The FBI provided data on appeals for 2012, and some
state and local agencies provided data on appeals and 
arrests for 2012. All information on appeals and arrests is 
reported as actual totals and not estimates. Twelve state 
agencies provided appeal counts and three state agencies 
provided arrest counts. Fifty-two local agencies provided 
appeal counts and 33 provided arrest counts. Because only 
a small number of agencies have historically provided 
information on appeals and arrests, BJS has decided to no 
longer collect these data as no reliable conclusions can be 
drawn and there is very limited utility in reporting the 
low number of responses received.

Definitions
*************

National Instant Criminal Background Check (NICS) is a
national system that checks available records in the 
following files to determine if prospective transferees are 
disqualified from receiving firearms: the Interstate 
Identification Index (III), a file that contains criminal 
history records on persons arrested for finger printable 
felonies and misdemeanors; the National Crime Information 
Center (NCIC), a database of 7 property files and 14 persons 
files that contain records on persons who are the subjects 
of protection orders, active criminal warrants, immigration 
violators, and other records; and the NICS Index, a database 
created solely for use by NICS that contains information on 
records that may not be included in III or NCIC, such as 
mental health records, fugitive from justice records, and 
drug-related records that are provided by federal, state, 
and local agencies about persons prohibited under federal 
law from receiving or possessing a firearm. Additionally, a 
fourth search of the applicable databases via the 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is conducted for 
background checks initiated on all non-United States 
citizens. 

Firearm is any weapon that is designed to or may readily be 
converted to expel a projectile by the action of an 
explosive. 

Handgun is a firearm that has a short stock and is designed 
to be held and fired using a single hand, such as a pistol 
or revolver.

Long gun is a firearm with a barrel extended to about
30 inches to improve accuracy and range, commonly with a
shoulder butt, and designed to be fired with two hands, such
as a rifle or shotgun.

Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) is also known as a
federally licensed firearms dealer. A dealer must be 
licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives (ATF) to be classified as an FFL and enrolled 
with the FBI’s NICS to request a NICS check.

Application for firearm transfer is information submitted
by a person to a state or local checking agency to purchase 
a firearm or obtain a permit that can be used for a purchase.
Information may be submitted directly to a checking agency 
or forwarded by a prospective seller.

Denial occurs when an applicant is prohibited from receiving 
a firearm or a permit that can be used to receive a firearm 
because a disqualifying factor was found during a background 
check.

Transactions are inquiries to the federal NICS system and
may include more than one inquiry per application.

Instant check (instant approval) systems require a seller to
transmit a purchaser’s application to a checking agency by
telephone or computer, after which the agency is required to
respond as quickly as possible.

Purchase permit systems require a prospective firearm
purchaser to obtain, after a background check, a
government-issued document (called a permit, license, or
identification card) that must be presented to a seller to
receive a firearm.

Exempt carry permit is a state carry permit (issued after a
background check) that exempts the holder from a check at
the time of purchase under an ATF regulation or state law.

Other approval systems require a seller to transmit a
purchaser’s application to a checking agency by telephone
or other electronic means. The agency is not required to
respond immediately, but must respond before the end of
the statutory time limit.

State notes
**************

The following notes provide additional information about
changes in state laws that occurred and about the types of
firearms included in a state’s instant checks, purchase 
permits, or other approval checks in 2012. State statutes 
should be consulted for complete details on a state’s 
firearms laws.

California--A state agency conducted other approval checks
on applicants for handgun and long gun transfers.

Colorado--A state agency conducted instant checks on
applicants for handgun and long gun transfers.

Connecticut--The state authorized two types of purchase
permits, and every handgun transferee was required to
obtain one of the permits during 2012. In addition, a state
agency conducted instant checks at the point of transfer on
applicants for handgun and long gun transfers.

Delaware--A state agency conducted instant checks on
applicants for handgun and long gun transfers until June 30,
2012. The checks were discontinued after that date because
of a change in state law. While the instant check law was in
force, the state’s carry permit gave the holder an exemption
from the instant check.

District of Columbia--The chief of police conducted checks
on applicants for a registration certificate (categorized as 
a purchase permit), which was required to obtain a handgun
or a long gun.

Florida--A state agency conducted instant checks on 
applicants for handgun and long gun transfers.

Hawaii--A purchase permit was required to obtain a handgun 
or a long gun. Checks on purchase permit applicants were 
conducted by local agencies.

Illinois--A purchase permit was required to obtain
a handgun or a long gun. In addition, a state agency
conducted instant checks at the point of transfer on
applicants for handgun and long gun transfers.

Iowa--A purchase permit was required to obtain a handgun.
An exempt carry permit may have been substituted for
the purchase permit. Local agencies conducted checks on
applicants for purchase and exempt carry permits.

Maryland--A state agency conducted other approval checks
on applicants for transfers of handguns and assault weapons,
which were designated by state law as regulated firearms.

Massachusetts--A purchase permit was required to obtain
a handgun or a long gun. Three types of purchase permits
were included in the FIST survey data. Checks on permit
applicants were conducted by local agencies.

Michigan--The state’s purchase permit was required for
all handgun transfers until December 18, 2012. On or after
that date, the purchase permit was required for a transfer
between two individuals who were not licensed dealers.
Checks on purchase permit applicants were conducted by
local agencies.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics of the U.S. Department of 
Justice is the principal federal agency responsible for 
measuring crime, criminal victimization, criminal offenders, 
victims of crime, correlates of crime, and the operation of 
criminal and civil justice systems at the federal, state, 
tribal, and local levels. BJS collects, analyzes, and 
disseminates reliable and valid statistics on crime and 
justice systems in the United States, supports improvements
to state and local criminal justice information systems, and 
participates with national and international organizations 
to develop and recommend national standards for justice
statistics. William J. Sabol is acting director.

The Regional Justice Information Service (REJIS) prepared 
these tables under the supervision of Allina D. Lee, of the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). Allen Beck, Ph.D., of 
the Bureau of Justice Statistics provided statistical 
consultation. Michael Planty provided verification. Terry
J. Tomazic, Ph.D., Professor of Sociology at Saint Louis 
University, and Trent D. Buskirk, Ph.D., Marketing Systems 
Group, provided statistical and sample design consultation.
The tables were prepared under BJS cooperative agreement 
#2011-BJ-CX-K017. The BJSsponsored Firearm Inquiry 
Statistics (FIST) program collects information on firearm
background checks conducted by state and local agencies and 
combines this information with Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) National Instant Criminal Background 
Check System (NICS) transaction data to create a national 
estimate of the number of applications received and denied 
annually pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention 
Act of 1993 and similar state laws.

Lynne McConnell of Lockheed Martin and Jill Thomas edited 
the report. Tina Dorsey and Barbara Quinn produced the 
report.
