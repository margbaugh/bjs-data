Campus Law Enforcement, 2011–12

Brian A. Reaves, Ph.D., BJS Statistician


During the 2011–12 school year, about two-thirds (68%) of the more than 900 
U.S. 4-year colleges and universities with 2,500 or more students used sworn 
police officers to provide law enforcement services on campus (figure 1). 
Sworn police officers have full arrest powers granted by a state or local 
authority. 

The percentage of public institutions (92%) using sworn officers was more 
than twice that of private institutions (38%). Similar to sworn officers, 
about two-thirds of campuses were served by armed officers. The percentage of 
public campuses (91%) using armed officers was also more than double the 
percentage of private institutions (36%). Among public institutions, nearly 
all students were enrolled on campuses with sworn (96%) and armed (94%) 
officers. Among private institutions, nearly half of the students were 
enrolled on campuses with sworn (46%) and armed (45%) officers.

These findings come from the 2011–12 Survey of Campus Law Enforcement 
Agencies, the first conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) since 
the 2004–05 school year. Among the institutions contacted for both the 2004–
05 and 2011–12 BJS surveys, the percentage using sworn officers increased 
from 75% to 77%, and the percentage using armed officers increased from 68% 
to 75% (not shown).

HIGHLIGHTS
************

Among 4-year institutions enrolling 2,500 or more students, during the 2011–
12 school yea--

* About 75% of the campuses were using armed officers, compared to 68% during 
the 2004-05 school year.
* About 9 in 10 public campuses used sworn police officers (92%), compared to 
about 4 in 10 private campuses (38%).

 * Most sworn campus police officers were authorized to use a sidearm (94%), 
chemical or pepper spray (94%), and a baton (93%). 

 * Most sworn campus police officers had arrest (86%) and patrol (81%) 
jurisdictions that extended beyond campus boundaries.

 * About 7 in 10 campus law enforcement agencies had a memorandum of 
understanding or other formal written agreement with outside law enforcement 
agencies.

* Most campus law enforcement agencies serving 5,000 or more students had 
personnel designated to address general crime prevention (91%), rape 
prevention (86%), drug education (79%), alcohol education (78%), stalking 
(75%), victim assistance (72%), and intimate partner violence (69%).

* Compared to private campuses, a higher percentage of campus law enforcement 
agencies on public campuses met regularly with special interest groups, such 
as advocacy groups (64% public compared to 43% private), and groups seeking 
to prevent domestic violence (69% compared to 48%) or sexual violence (76% 
compared to 58%).

* Nearly all campuses had a mass notification system that used email, text 
messages, and other methods to alert and instruct students, faculty, and 
staff in emergency situations.  
*************************************************************

A majority of the campuses with sworn police officers also used nonsworn 
security officers. Overall, 41% of campuses were served by both types of 
officers (table 1). About a third of campuses (32%) were served by nonsworn 
officers exclusively. The percentage of campuses using sworn officers ranged 
from a high of 96% among public campuses with 10,000 or more students to a 
low of 30% among private campuses with 2,500 to 4,999 students.

The officers were armed at more than 9 in 10 campuses using sworn personnel 
(table 2). Among the campuses using only nonsworn officers, about 1 in 10 had 
armed officers. Overall, 66% of campuses had armed officers.

*************************************************
About 95% of 4-year schools with 2,500 or more 
students operated their own campus law 
enforcement agency
*************************************************

The 905 4-year colleges and universities with 2,500 or more students 
contacted for the 2011–12 Survey of Campus Law Enforcement Agencies (see 
Methodology for exclusions) enrolled 82% of all students attending 4-year 
institutions (those primarily awarding 4-year degrees or higher) (appendix 
table 1). A total of 861 (95%) of these schools reported that they operated 
their own campus law enforcement agency using officers employed by the 
institution (appendix table 2). Among the institutions that did not operate 
their own campus law enforcement agency, 77% contracted with a private 
security firm to provide these services, and 18% used local law enforcement 
agencies.

All 861 campus law enforcement agencies serving 2,500 or more students 
received the BJS survey. Agencies serving campuses with 5,000 or more 
students received a longer questionnaire than those serving smaller campuses 
(see Methodology).

A majority (83%) of the schools that were within scope for the 2011–12 survey 
but not for the 2004–05 survey were in the smallest enrollment category 
(2,500 to 4,999 students). Since the inclusion of these schools could mask 
trends occurring on larger campuses, comparisons presented in the report are 
limited to the 724 institutions and 717 campus law enforcement agencies that 
were included in both surveys. The comparison agencies represent 96% of the 
agencies and 98% of the total enrollment covered by the 2004–05 survey. These 
agencies accounted for 94% of the total enrollment covered by the 2011–12 
survey.

*************************************************
Between the 2004–05 and 2011–12 school years, 
the increase in full-time campus law enforcement 
employees (16%) outpaced the increase in student 
enrollment (11%)
*************************************************

The 861 campus law enforcement agencies serving campuses with 2,500 or more 
students employed about 32,000 persons on a full-time basis during the 2011–
12 school year (appendix table 3). The full-time total included about 15,000 
sworn police officers, 11,000 nonsworn security officers, 5,000 civilian 
support staff, and 1,000 student employees. These agencies also employed 
another 12,000 part-time staff, including about 1,000 sworn police officers, 
3,000 nonsworn security officers, 1,000 civilian support staff, and 7,000 
students.

The 717 campus law enforcement agencies included in both the 2004–05 and 
2011–12 BJS surveys increased their number of full-time employees by 16% 
during the 7-year period. This included a 10% increase in the number of full-
time sworn personnel. During the same period, the collective enrollment of 
students on these campuses increased by 11% (not shown).

*************************************************
Agencies serving private campuses had an average 
of 4.8 full-time employees per 1,000 students 
compared to 3.6 per 1,000 on public campuses
*************************************************

During the 2011–12 school year, agencies serving campuses with 2,500 or more 
students had an average of 37 full-time employees, the equivalent of 4.1 
employees per 1,000 students (table 3). The average ratio was higher on 
private campuses (4.8 full-time employees per 1,000 students) than public 
campuses (3.6 full-time employees per 1,000 students).

On campuses with sworn personnel, an average of 24 full-time sworn officers 
were employed, the equivalent of 2.4 officers per 1,000 students. The average 
ratio was higher on private campuses (2.9 full-time sworn officers per 1,000 
students) than public campuses (2.2 full-time sworn officers per 1,000 
students).

*************************************************
About 9 in 10 sworn campus police officers had 
arrest jurisdiction beyond campus boundaries
*************************************************

The arrest jurisdiction of nearly all sworn campus police officers extended 
beyond the campus (table 4). In 86% of agencies (employing 90% of officers) 
the arrest jurisdiction included properties adjacent to campus. In 71% of 
agencies (employing 76% of officers) the jurisdiction included areas outside 
the area surrounding the campus (not shown). In 70% of agencies (employing 
71% of officers) the area of off-campus arrest jurisdiction was defined 
through a memorandum of understanding (MOU) or mutual aid agreement (MAA).

Overall, 88% of the agencies serving public campuses had MOUs or MAAs of some 
type, compared to 63% of the agencies serving private campuses (figure 2). 
Most of the agencies serving public campuses had agreements with local police 
departments (81%) and sheriffs’ offices (55%). About a third of these 
agencies had agreements with state law enforcement (35%) or other campus law 
enforcement agencies (31%). About half of the agencies serving private 
campuses had written agreements with local police (52%) and about a sixth had 
agreements with sheriffs’ offices (17%).

As with their arrest jurisdiction, most sworn officers had patrol 
jurisdictions that went beyond the boundaries of the campus they served. On 
81% of campuses, sworn officers had patrol jurisdictions that extended to 
properties adjacent to campus, compared to 44% for nonsworn officers (table 
5). The patrol jurisdiction of sworn officers extended to properties outside 
the immediate campus in 57% of agencies, compared to 27% for nonsworn 
officers. Agencies using sworn officers were also more likely to use an MOU 
or MAA to define extended areas of patrol jurisdiction.

*************************************************
Most campus law enforcement agencies serving 
campuses with 5,000 or more students conducted 
joint patrols with local law enforcement
*************************************************

As in 2004–05, most of campus law enforcement agencies implemented various 
community-oriented policing practices during the 2011–12 school year. About 8 
in 10 (79%) agencies serving campuses with 5,000 or more students had 
incorporated community policing elements into their overall campus security 
policy (table 6). At least 6 in 10 agencies gave officers responsibility for 
specific geographic areas on campus (63%), conducted joint patrols with local 
law enforcement (62%), or conducted a ride-along program (60%).

During 2011–12, about half of agencies serving campuses with 5,000 or more 
students upgraded their technology to support the analysis of campus 
community problems (54%). They also actively encouraged officers to engage in 
problem-solving projects on campus (51%), partnered with citizen groups and 
used their feedback in developing community policing strategies (51%), 
conducted intelligence-led policing (49%), conducted environmental analysis 
to assess precursors to crime (48%), and included collaborative problem-
solving projects in the evaluation of patrol officers (46%).

*************************************************
More campus law enforcement agencies were engaging 
in community policing activities during the 2011–12 
school year compared to 2004–05
*************************************************

All but 3 of the 12 community-oriented policing activities included in the 
2011–12 survey were implemented on a greater percentage of public campuses 
than private campuses. The largest differences were for offering ride-along 
programs (68% public versus 36% private), encouraging officers to engage in 
problem-solving projects (55% versus 38%), and conducting joint patrols with 
local law enforcement (65% versus 52%).

For the 501 agencies serving campuses with 5,000 or more students that 
responded to both the 2004–05 and 2011–12 surveys, the use of community 
policing techniques increased at least 8% for 5 of the 10 community policing 
activities (figure 3). The largest increases were for collaborative problem-
solving in the evaluation of patrol officers (46% in 2011–12 compared to 21% 
in 2004–05), conducting a ride-along program (61% compared to 49%), and 
encouraging officers to engage in problem-solving projects (52% compared to 
39%).

*************************************************
Nearly all campus law enforcement agencies 
provided 24-hour patrol coverage at all times
*************************************************

Ninety-six percent of agencies provided 24-hour patrol coverage with 
uniformed officers at all times, including during weekends, breaks between 
academic terms, and summer terms. Most of the remaining agencies provided 
regular patrol coverage, but not on a 24-hour basis (not shown).

All agencies had uniformed officers on duty at all times (table 7). About 9 
in 10 public campuses had sworn uniformed officers on duty at all times, 
while about 3 in 10 public campuses had both sworn and nonsworn uniformed 
officers on duty at all times. About 8 in 10 private campuses had nonsworn 
uniformed officers on duty at all times, and about 2 in 10 private campuses 
had both sworn and nonsworn uniformed officers on duty at all times.

Approximately 11% of agencies used officers from local law enforcement 
agencies at times to increase patrol coverage on campus or assist with 
special events during the 2011–12 school year. Four percent of agencies used 
officers from private security firms to supplement patrol coverage, and 24% 
used private security officers to assist with special events (not shown).

Overall, 45% of the agencies serving campuses with enrollments of 5,000 or 
more used student security patrols. Half of the agencies serving public 
campuses (50%) and about a third of those serving private campuses (32%) used 
student patrols (not shown). On most campuses with student patrols, they were 
used to provide safety escorts (89%), special event security (70%), auxiliary 
patrols during normal patrol hours (64%), and building lockup or unlock 
services (59%)(figure 4).

*************************************************
Most agencies offered free on-demand walking 
and vehicle safety escort services
*************************************************

About 9 in 10 campus law enforcement agencies serving 5,000 or more students 
provided a personal safety escort service during the 2011–12 school year 
(table 8). Typically, this is a free and confidential on-demand service that 
operates at night for students, faculty, staff, and others who request it. 
The percentage of agencies that provided a safety escort service was about 
the same on public (88%) and private (90%) campuses.

Most agencies that served public campuses operated a safety escort service 
staffed with nonsworn security officers (72%), sworn police officers (62%), 
and students (59%). About 5 in 6 private campuses had a safety escort service 
staffed by nonsworn security officers (83%). Just under half had a service 
staffed by sworn officers (48%) or students (45%). About 71% of public and 
private campuses provided both walking safety escorts and vehicle safety 
escorts.

*************************************************
Nearly all agencies participated in a 9-1-1 
system or had a similar on-campus emergency 
telephone system
*************************************************

In an emergency, campus law enforcement agencies could be contacted by 
picking up a blue-light phone on campus (92%), calling a 3- or 4-digit on-
campus emergency phone number (70%), or calling 9-1-1 (65%) (table 9). Almost 
all campuses (94%) either participated in a 9-1-1 system or provided another 
emergency number. A higher percentage of agencies serving public campuses 
(71%) participated in a 9-1-1 system than those serving private campuses 
(55%). More agencies on private campuses (80%) offered an on-campus emergency 
number than on public campuses (63%). Nearly two-thirds of public campuses 
(64%) and about half of private campuses (50%) had both systems (not shown).

About half of the agencies serving public campuses (52%) and about a third of 
those on private campuses (35%) participated in an enhanced 9-1-1 system, 
which could display caller location and identification when available. About 
three-quarters (74%) of campus law enforcement agencies had an emergency 
telephone system that displayed the number of a wireless caller (table 10). 
Fewer agencies had a system that could display the general (13%) or specific 
(4%) location of a wireless caller.

Other advanced features of campus emergency telephone systems included 
recorded phone calls available for immediate playback (65%), “phone patch” 
call forwarding when dispatch was not available (39%), and reverse 9-1-1 
call-back (30%). Nearly all sworn (94%) and nonsworn (92%) agencies were 
responsible for dispatching calls for service (not shown).

*************************************************
Nearly all sworn officers were authorized to use 
a sidearm, chemical spray, and baton
*************************************************

Nearly all of the agencies that employed sworn police officers authorized 
them to use a sidearm (94%), chemical or pepper spray (94%), and a baton 
(93%) (table 11). Fewer than half (40%) of these agencies authorized their 
sworn officers to use a conducted energy device (such as a Taser).

Among agencies that employed only nonsworn security officers, 11% authorized 
them to carry a sidearm. About half of agencies authorized nonsworn officers 
to use chemical or pepper spray (48%), and about a third authorized them to 
use a baton (32%). Few nonsworn agencies authorized their officers to use a 
conducted energy device (4%). In agencies employing both nonsworn and sworn 
officers, the nonsworn officers were somewhat less likely to be authorized to 
use a sidearm (4%), chemical or pepper spray (44%), or a baton (21%) than in 
agencies that employed only nonsworn officers (not shown).

Overall, 96% of sworn officers were employed by an agency that authorized 
them to use chemical or pepper spray, compared to 39% of nonsworn officers 
(figure 5). Two percent of nonsworn officers were employed by an agency that 
authorized them to use a conducted energy device, compared to 38% of sworn 
officers.

*************************************************
Patrol officers used in-field computers in about 
twice as many agencies during 2011–12, compared 
to 2004–05
*************************************************

Patrol officers were using in-field computers in about half (52%) of campus 
law enforcement agencies serving 2,500 or more students during 2011–12, 
compared to about a quarter (27%) of agencies during 2004–05. Most agencies 
serving public campuses with 5,000 or more students and private campuses with 
10,000 or more students used in-field computers during 2011–12 (table 12). 
During 2011–12, agencies employing sworn officers (64%) were about three 
times as likely to use in-field computers as agencies that employed only 
nonsworn officers (20%) (not shown).

Half of campus law enforcement agencies provided patrol officers with 
handheld electronic devices (such as smart phones or personal digital 
assistants) during the 2011–12 school year. Overall, patrol officers in 71% 
of campus law enforcement agencies used either in-field computers or handheld 
devices during 2011–12.

A majority of agencies on both public (82%) and private (66%) campuses used 
computer-aided dispatch (figure 6). Most agencies serving public campuses 
also used computers for inter-agency information sharing (70%) and in-field 
reporting (60%). About a third of the agencies serving public (36%) and 
private (29%) campuses used computers for crime mapping. 

Agencies that employed sworn officers were about twice as likely as those 
that employed only nonsworn officers to use computers for dispatch (83% sworn 
versus 47% nonsworn)information sharing (69% versus 32%), in-field reports 
(59% versus 29%), and crime mapping (37% versus 20%) (not shown).

*************************************************
Agencies provided security for a wide range 
of campus facilities
*************************************************

In addition to the core law enforcement functions of patrol and response, 
campus law enforcement agencies performed numerous functions related to the 
security of campus buildings, facilities, and property. For more than 80% of 
sworn and nonsworn agencies, these responsibilities included general security 
functions, such as locking and unlocking buildings (92% sworn versus 100% 
nonsworn), monitoring surveillance cameras (85% versus 93%), controlling 
access to facilities (83% versus 95%), and monitoring central alarm systems 
(85% versus 82%) (table 13). 

The majority of sworn and nonsworn campus law enforcement agencies were also 
responsible for vehicle-related functions, such as directing and controlling 
traffic (99% sworn versus 93% nonsworn), enforcing parking restrictions (91% 
versus 95%), and investigating traffic accidents (97% versus 79%). Nearly all 
sworn agencies (94%) also enforced traffic laws, compared to about half of 
nonsworn agencies (47%). Nearly three-quarters (72%) of nonsworn agencies 
administered vehicle registration systems, compared to half (50%) of sworn 
agencies. Campus law enforcement agencies operated a wide range of vehicles 
to support many of the functions they performed (appendix table 8).

*************************************************
Agencies serving public campuses were more 
likely to meet with groups working to prevent 
domestic and sexual violence
*************************************************

During the 2011–12 school year, most agencies met regularly with campus 
administrators and officials (97%), other law enforcement agencies (93%), 
faculty and staff organizations (87%), student housing groups (86%), student 
organizations (81%), and student government leaders (80%) to discuss crime-
related problems (table 14). A majority also met regularly with sexual 
violence prevention groups (69%), domestic violence prevention groups (60%), 
and advocacy groups (55%).

*************************************************************

*************************************************
The Clery Act and reporting campus crime
*************************************************

The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime 
Statistics Act was signed into law in 1990 as the Campus Security Act, and it 
has been amended several times. The act requires institutions of higher 
education that participate in federal financial aid programs to keep and 
disclose information about crime on and near their campus. The U.S. 
Department of Education monitors compliance. Violations can result in 
penalties of up to $35,000 per infraction and suspension from federal student 
financial aid programs. The Clery Act requires institutions to fulfill the 
following obligations:

* Publish an annual campus security report by October 1 that documents three 
calendar years of specified campus crime statistics. This report must be made 
available to current and prospective students and employees. The crime 
statistics must include incidents occurring on campus, in public areas 
adjacent to or running through the campus, and at certain off-campus 
buildings, such as Greek housing and remote classrooms. 

* Maintain a timely public log of all crimes reported or otherwise known to 
campus law enforcement officials. The log must be accessible to the public 
during normal business hours.

* Give timely warning of crimes that represent a threat to student or 
employee safety. 

Institutions also must submit an annual report to the U.S. Department of 
Education. The report should include statistics on criminal homicide, sex 
offenses (forcible and nonforcible), robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, 
motor vehicle theft, and arson. The report must identify any of these 
offenses, as well as any incidents of larceny or theft; simple assault; 
intimidation; and destruction, damage, or vandalism of property that are 
believed to be hate crimes. The report must also include arrests and 
disciplinary referrals for liquor law violations, drug law violations, and 
illegal weapons possession. Clery Act statistics are available at 
http://ope.ed.gov/security/.

Campus law enforcement agencies serving 4-year schools with 2,500 or more 
students handled an average of 5 violent crimes each in 2011, compared to 180 
property crimes (table 15). During 2011, violent crimes accounted for 3% of 
the serious crimes known to campus agencies, compared to 12% of the serious 
crimes known to state and local law enforcement agencies nationwide (not 
shown).

These campus agencies recorded 45 violent crimes per 100,000 students in 
2011, a rate which was 27% lower than in 2004 (figure 7). Although the 
violent crime rate remained higher on private campuses (53) than public 
campuses (42) in 2011, the difference was much less than in 2004. The overall 
violent crime rate on campuses was much lower than the U.S. violent crime 
rate of 386 per 100,000 residents. 

Campus law enforcement agencies serving schools with 2,500 or more students 
recorded 1,049 property crimes per 100,000 students during 2011. As with 
violent crimes, the overall property crime rate per 100,000 students was 
higher on private campuses (1,354) than public campuses (994). Campus 
property crime rates were 35% lower in 2011, compared to 2004. Nationwide, 
the rate for known serious property crimes was 2,909 per 100,000 residents in 
2011, or about three times the campus rate (not shown).
*************************************************************

Agencies on public campuses were more likely than those on private campuses 
to have met regularly with most of the types of interest groups included in 
the survey. The largest differences were observed for advocacy (64% public 
versus 43% private), domestic violence prevention (69% versus 48%), and 
sexual violence prevention groups (76% versus 58%).

For all but one of the group types included in both 2004–05 and 2011–012 
surveys, there was an increase in the percentage of the agencies meeting with 
them (figure 8). Increases of more than 10% were observed for local public 
officials (64% versus 41%), domestic violence groups (63% versus 45%), and 
advocacy groups (61% versus 48%) (figure 8).

*************************************************
About 4 in 5 agencies had personnel designated 
to provide alcohol and drug education
*************************************************

Most agencies serving campuses of 5,000 or more students had personnel 
specially designated to provide prevention, education, and assistance 
programs and services to the campus community. More than two-thirds of the 
agencies had personnel designated to address general crime prevention (91%), 
general rape prevention (86%), date rape prevention (84%), self-defense 
training (76%), stalking (75%), victim assistance (72%), and intimate partner 
violence (69%) (table 16). In addition, about 4 in 5 agencies had personnel 
addressing drug (79%) and alcohol education (78%).

In some cases, the personnel who addressed these issues were assigned full 
time to a specialized unit. At least 1 in 10 agencies had specialized units 
for general crime prevention (28%), community policing (21%), general rape 
prevention (14%), date rape prevention (14%), victim assistance (12%), self-
defense training (11%), alcohol education (10%), drug education (10%), and 
bicycle and pedestrian safety (10%).

*************************************************
More agencies had personnel designated to 
address stalking, alcohol education, and victim 
assistance in 2011–12, compared to 2004–05
*************************************************

For all but one of the interest group types included in both 2004–05 and 
2011–12 surveys, there was an increase in the percentage of agencies meeting 
with them (figure 9). Increases of 5% were observed for stalking (76% versus 
67%), alcohol education (80% versus 74%), and victim assistance (72% versus 
67%).

*************************************************
A majority of the agencies on both public and 
private campuses engaged in a range of emergency 
preparedness activities
*************************************************

The 2004–05 BJS Survey of Campus Law Enforcement Agencies helped assess the 
impact of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, on the emergency 
preparedness policies and practices of campus law enforcement agencies. In 
the years following that survey, the mass shootings at Virginia Tech in 2007 
and Northern Illinois University in 2008 occurred. The 2011–12 survey 
provides some measures of how campus law enforcement agencies have responded 
to these and similar incidents by further developing their emergency 
preparedness capabilities.

During 2011–12, more agencies serving public campuses, compared to private 
campuses, disseminated information to increase citizen preparedness (90% 
public compared to 81% private), had formal intelligence-sharing agreements 
with other law enforcement agencies (74% versus 62%), and designed or revised 
a preparedness plan for a school shooting (86% versus 81%) (table 17). A 
slightly higher percentage of the agencies on private campuses (85%) than on 
public campuses (81%) designed or revised a preparedness plan for an 
emergency evacuation. Nearly all agencies on both public (99%) and private 
(98%) campuses participated in campus meetings regarding emergency 
preparedness plans. 

*************************************************
Between the 2004–05 and 2011–12 school years, 
the percentage of agencies participating in 
emergency preparedness activities increased
*************************************************

The percentage of agencies that held meetings with campus administrators and 
staff regarding emergency preparedness increased from 91% in 2004–05 to 99% 
in 2011–12 (figure 10). Increases also occurred in the percentage of agencies 
that disseminated information to increase citizen preparedness and maintained 
formal intelligence-sharing agreements with other law enforcement agencies.

Almost all (97%) campus law enforcement agencies serving 5,000 or more 
students reported they were participants in active shooter training during 
2011–12. This training was usually in the form of workshops, seminars, and 
lectures (95%) and typically involved the use of mock exercises and scenarios 
(90%). About a third of agencies participated in active shooter training that 
included the use of virtual reality systems (31%) (not shown).

*************************************************
More agencies on public campuses than on private 
campuses had radio systems that were fully 
interoperable with other first responders’ systems
*************************************************

About half (48%) of campus law enforcement agencies serving campuses with 
2,500 or more students used a radio system that was fully interoperable with 
the systems used by local law enforcement agencies, fire departments, and 
other first responders (table 18). Another 30% reported their system was 
partially interoperable with other first responder systems. Agencies serving 
public campuses (64%) were more than twice as likely as those on private 
campuses (26%) to have a system that was fully interoperable. Nearly all of 
the agencies on public campuses (93%) had systems that were either fully or 
partially interoperable, compared to just over half on private campuses 
(57%).

*************************************************
Most campuses had a mass notification system to 
alert and instruct students, faculty, and staff 
in an emergency situation
*************************************************

The recognized potential for an emergency to occur on campus has resulted in 
the development of sophisticated mass notification systems that can alert 
students, faculty, and staff about a situation and provide critical 
information and instructions. Survey questions regarding mass notification 
systems were asked for the first time in the 2011–12 BJS survey and covered 
agencies serving campuses with 5,000 or more students. All but a few of these 
campuses reported they had a mass notification system available for students, 
faculty, and staff.

Nearly two-thirds (63%) of the campuses had opt-in systems that allowed 
first-year students to enroll voluntarily (table 19). Most of the remainder 
had opt-out mass notification systems that required students to enroll, but 
allowed them to discontinue their enrollment at some point if they preferred. 
For faculty, administrators, and staff, about 70% of campuses had voluntary 
opt-in mass notification systems, and 26% used a mandatory opt-out format.

Campus mass notification systems used a wide variety of methods for alerting 
the campus community and conveying emergency information and instructions. 
The most common methods used were e-mail (100% of students covered), text 
messages (99%), and websites (98%) (figure 11). About three-quarters of 
students were enrolled on campuses that used cell phone calls (77%) and 
voicemails (73%). About half of students were enrolled on campuses that used 
sirens (56%), outdoor speakers (54%), radio (52%), and television (46%).

*************************************************
The hiring process for sworn campus police 
officers typically involved more than twice as 
many screening methods as nonsworn officers
*************************************************

To employ the most qualified officers, campus law enforcement agencies use 
numerous screening methods. Typically, sworn officers must undergo a 
considerably more rigorous screening process prior to hiring than their 
nonsworn counterparts. Of the 20 screening methods included in the 2011–12 
survey, a majority of sworn officers worked in agencies that used 12 methods 
for hiring sworn officers. Most nonsworn officers worked in agencies that 
used five of the screening methods for hiring nonsworn officers. The five 
screening methods generally used for both sworn and nonsworn officers 
included personal interviews, criminal record checks, reference checks, 
background investigations, and driving record checks (figure 12).

Screening methods used for more than three-quarters of sworn officers but 
less than half of nonsworn officers included medical exams, drug tests, and 
psychological evaluations. Screening methods used for more than half of sworn 
officers, but less than half of nonsworn officers, included credit history 
checks, physical agility tests, personality inventories, and written aptitude 
tests. Overall, none of the screening methods included in the survey was used 
for a larger percentage of nonsworn officers than sworn ones.

*************************************************
On average, sworn campus police officers were 
required to complete about 4 times the training 
as nonsworn officers prior to employment
*************************************************

There was also a significant difference in the amount of training required of 
new sworn officers compared to nonsworn officers. The average training 
requirement for entry-level sworn officers during 2011–12 was 1,027 hours, 
with approximately two-thirds of it in the classroom and a third in the field 
(figure 13). Nonsworn officers were required to complete an average of about 
230 hours of training, which were split almost evenly between classroom and 
field training.

*************************************************
About 1 in 5 sworn officers and 1 in 7 nonsworn 
officers worked for an agency with a college 
education requirement
*************************************************

Most sworn (74%) and nonsworn (76%) campus officers worked for an agency that 
required them to have at least a high school diploma, but did not specify any 
college-level education requirement (table 20). About 1 in 5 sworn officers 
worked for an agency that had some type of college requirement for new sworn 
officers, compared to about 1 in 7 nonsworn officers. About 3% of sworn 
officers were employed by an agency with a 4-year degree requirement for new 
sworn officers, and 9% by an agency with a 2-year degree requirement. 
Agencies with a 4-year degree requirement for nonsworn officers employed 3% 
of all nonsworn officers, while those with a 2-year degree requirement for 
nonsworn officers employed 5% of all nonsworn officers.

Although data availability was more limited than for other survey items, 
agencies provided information on the highest education attainment of about 
9,000 sworn officers (60% of the total) and about 4,000 nonsworn officers 
(36% of the total). Based on these data, sworn officers (57%) were about 
twice as likely as nonsworn officers (30%) to have at least a 2-year degree. 
About 43% of sworn officers had a 4-year degree or higher, compared to 21% of 
nonsworn officers (not shown).

*************************************************
The average starting salary for entry-level sworn 
officers was 34% higher than for nonsworn officers
*************************************************

Consistent with the more rigorous selection process used for hiring sworn 
officers compared to nonsworn officers, significant differences were found in 
the salaries and benefits offered to the two types of officers. The average 
starting salary for entry-level sworn officers was $36,700 in 2011–12, 
compared to $27,500 for entry-level nonsworn officers (table 21). For those 
with 5 years of experience, sworn officers earned an average base salary of 
$42,700, compared to $31,600 for nonsworn officers. Dispatch operators earned 
an average starting salary of $28,000 in sworn agencies, compared to $26,000 
in nonsworn agencies (not shown in table).

On larger public campuses (15,000 or more students), the average starting 
salary for entry-level sworn officers was about $40,000, compared to about 
$33,000 on the smallest public campuses (2,500 to 4,999 students). On private 
campuses, average starting salaries for sworn officers ranged from $32,000 on 
the smallest campuses to $44,000 on the largest. For nonsworn officers, by 
enrollment category, average starting salaries ranged from about $27,000 to 
$33,000 on public campuses and from about $26,000 to $31,000 on private 
campuses.

Among campuses with 5,000 or more students, slightly more sworn (51%) than 
nonsworn (43%) officers worked for an agency that authorized collective 
bargaining for them (figure 14). Starting salaries for sworn officers 
averaged about $43,000 in the agencies with collective bargaining, compared 
to about $34,000 in those without it. Likewise, average starting salaries 
were higher for nonsworn officers in agencies with collective bargaining 
($35,000) than in those without it ($28,000) (not shown).

Nearly all sworn and nonsworn officers (99% each) worked for agencies that 
allowed them to earn overtime pay or comp time. Most sworn (93%) and nonsworn 
officers (98%) also had access to tuition assistance from their agency in the 
form of a waiver, reimbursement, or discount. Sworn officers (25%) were five 
times as likely as nonsworn officers (5%) to work for an agency that offered 
educational incentive pay. Nonsworn officers were more likely than sworn 
officers to work for an agency that offered shift differential pay and 
merit/performance pay.

A higher percentage of sworn officers (37%) than nonsworn officers (28%) 
worked for an agency that offered them longevity pay. For both types of 
officers, the most common service requirement for longevity pay was 10 years 
(33%) followed by 5 years (21%). About 13% of sworn officers worked for an 
agency that required a written service agreement that required them to serve 
a minimum term, usually 2 or 3 years. One percent of nonsworn officers worked 
for an agency that required a service agreement (not shown).

*************************************************
The percentage of sworn campus police officers 
who were women or members of a racial/ethnic 
minority increased slightly
*************************************************

During the 2011–12 school year, about 1 in 6 sworn campus police officers 
were women. This was about the same proportion observed in the 2004–05 
survey. When campuses that were included in both surveys are compared, the 
percentage of female officers increased slightly, from 16.9% in 2004–05 to 
17.5% in 2011–12 (figure 15). Minority representation increased slightly as 
well, from 30.4% in 2004–05 to 31.5% in 2011–12. Hispanics recorded the 
largest increase during this period, from 6.5% to 7.5%. African Americans 
remained the largest minority, accounting for 21% of sworn officers in both 
surveys.

Methodology
**************

This report presents data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) 2011-
12 Survey of Campus Law Enforcement Agencies. In preparation for the survey, 
a universe list of 4-year and 2-year campuses was compiled using the U.S. 
Department of Education’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System 
(IPEDS).

The survey focused primarily on agencies serving 4-year universities and 
colleges with a fall headcount enrollment of 2,500 or more (appendix table 
1). In addition, 2-year institutions with 2,500 or more students and a sample 
of 4-year institutions with 1,000 to 2,499 students were surveyed. These 
campuses are covered in a separate report. Schools were classified according 
to the level of the highest proportion of degrees awarded.

The survey excluded--

* U.S. military academies and schools

* for-profit institutions

* schools operating primarily online.

BJS also conducted surveys of campus law enforcement agencies covering the 
1994–95 and 2004–05 school years. The reports produced from these surveys are 
available on the BJS website.

Of the 905 4-year campuses with 2,500 or more students identified as being 
potentially eligible for the 2011–12 survey, 861 reported that they were 
operating their own campus law enforcement agency (appendix table 2). These 
861 agencies were asked to provide data describing their personnel, 
functions, expenditures and pay, operations, equipment, computers and 
information systems, community policing activities, specialized units, and 
emergency preparedness activities. ICF International, with the assistance of 
BJS, served as the data collection agent.

The 2011–12 survey was initially conducted as a web-only data collection. 
Later follow-up efforts provided respondents with fax and mail-in response 
options. The final overall response rate was 90% for the core survey group of 
agencies serving 4-year campuses with 2,500 or more students, with 776 of 861 
potential respondents completing either the long or short version of the 
survey questionnaire (appendix table 9).

While there were initially only two versions of the survey questionnaire--a 
64-question long version and a 36-question short version--a third 23-question 
critical items version was added during the nonresponse follow-up phase of 
the data collection. The fourth and final response option asked agencies to 
provide only some very basic information, the most important being the number 
of full-time and part-time employees in each personnel category. Appendix 
table 10 provides a list of the items included in each version of the survey 
questionnaire.

A total of 537 agencies on campuses with 5,000 or more students received the 
long version of the survey questionnaire. A total of 456 (85%) of these 
agencies completed the long version. Agencies that chose not to complete the 
long version of the survey form were subsequently given the option of 
completing the shorter 36-question version. A total of 31 (6%) of the 
original long-form agencies completed the short form. Agencies that did not 
respond to the short-form option received the critical items version. A total 
of 17 agencies (3% of the original long-form agencies) completed the critical 
items version. The remaining 33 agencies (6% of those who initially received 
the long form) did not respond to any of the three response options offered. 
These agencies were subsequently contacted for basic information including 
the number and type of employees in their agency.

A total of 324 agencies serving 4-year campuses with 2,500 to 4,999 students 
received the shorter 36-question form. A total of 289 (89%) of these agencies 
completed this version. Agencies that chose not to complete the short version 
were given the option of completing the critical items version. Five (2%) 
short-form agencies completed the critical items version. The remaining 30 
(9%) short-form agencies provided the basic information requested on the type 
and number of personnel.

The final data set for agencies serving 4-year campuses with 2,500 or more 
students includes 456 agencies that completed the long version of the survey 
questionnaire, 320 agencies that completed the short version, 22 agencies 
that completed the critical items version, and 63 agencies that provided only 
the basic personnel counts.
