In 1999, 2.3% of State prison inmates, 
0.9% of Federal prison inmates, and 1.7%
of local jail inmates were known to be
infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV).  At yearend 1999 correctional 
authorities reported that 24,607 State 
inmates and 1,150 Federal inmates were HIV 
positive.  At midyear 1999, when the last 
census was conducted, 8,615 local jail 
inmates were known to be HIV positive.

Of those known to be HIV positive in all
U.S. prisons, 6,642 were confirmed AIDS
cases, while 17,718 either showed symptoms 
of HIV infection or were asymptomatic. Of 
those in jail, 3,081 had confirmed AIDS.

During 1999, 242 State prisoners (20 per
100,000) died from AIDS-related causes,
down from 1,010 in 1995.  In 1999 about
1 in 12 State prison inmate deaths were
attributed to AIDS; in 1995 about 1 in 3. 
Between July 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999,
78 jail inmates (13 per 100,000) died from
AIDS-related causes.      

Data on HIV/AIDS for prison inmates were
provided by the departments of corrections 
in 50 States and the District of Columbia 
and by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Data 
for jail inmates were provided by 3,365 
locally administered confinement facilities. 

Number of HIV-infected prison 
inmates up slightly from 1997 
to 1999

At yearend 1999, 25,757 inmates in State
and Federal prisons were known to be
infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV).  Since 1997, among States that 
reported data in all three years, the 
number known to be HIV positive rose 6.4% 
from 23,779 to 25,296. 

On December 31, 1999, 24,607 State
prison inmates and 1,150 Federal inmates
were known to be HIV positive.  The
percent of the total prison population with
HIV/AIDS -- 2.1% in 1997, 2.2% in 1998,
and 2.1% in 1999 -- remained stable.  

HIV-positive inmates comprised 2.3% of
the State prison population in 1999 down
from 2.4% in 1995.  In Federal prisons,
HIV-positive inmates comprised 0.9% in
1999, unchanged from 1995.

HIV-infected inmates were concentrated
in relatively few States.  New York
(7,000), Florida (2,633), and Texas
(2,520) held the largest number of
HIV-positive inmates.  In 1999 these 
three States housed nearly half of all
HIV-infected inmates in State prisons.

Inmates in the Northeast had the
highest rates of HIV infection

Within the Northeast, 6.0% of the State
prison population were HIV positive in
1999, followed by 2.2% in the South, 1.0%
in the Midwest, and 0.9% in the West. 
New York had the highest percentage of
inmates known to be HIV positive (9.7%),
followed by the District of Columbia
(7.8%) and Rhode Island (6.9%).  

Six States (Maine, Montana, North
Dakota, South Dakota, West Virginia, and
Wyoming) reported 10 or fewer cases of
HIV-positive inmates in their prisons.  
In 1999 every State reported at least one
HIV-positive inmate.  Six States reported
that fewer than 0.5% of their inmate population 
were HIV positive.  Between 1998 and 1999 the
largest decrease of HIV-positive inmates
was reported in New York -- 7,000 in
1999, down from 7,500 in 1998.  The
largest increases were reported in Florida
(up 172), Maryland (134), and Texas
(127). 

The number of confirmed AIDS 
cases in U.S. prisons has increased 
every year since 1995

At the end of 1999, 6,642 inmates in U.S.
prisons had confirmed AIDS: 6,211 State
inmates and 431 Federal inmates.   

Confirmed AIDS cases made up 0.6% of
all inmates in State and Federal prisons. 
Of those known to be HIV-positive
inmates, over a quarter had confirmed
AIDS.

The States with the largest number of
confirmed AIDS cases were New York
(1,170), Texas (994), Florida (804), and
California (553).  Combined, these States
made up more than half of all confirmed
AIDS cases in State prisons. Nineteen
States reported having fewer than 10
confirmed AIDS cases in their prisons.

The District of Columbia (1.8%) reported
the highest percentage of confirmed
AIDS, followed by New York (1.6%),
Connecticut (1.5%), Maryland (1.4%), and
Massachusetts (1.3%).  In 16 States
confirmed AIDS cases comprised 0.1% or
less of State inmates.

Because some States each year did not
report the number of cases according to
the type of HIV infection, estimates of 
the number of confirmed AIDS cases were
made for those States to provide
comparable year-to-year data.  Based on
yearly estimates, the number of confirmed
AIDS cases increased from 6,809 in 1998
to 6,825 in 1999.  Overall, since 1995 
the estimated number of confirmed AIDS
cases has increased by 1,668 -- an
annual average increase of 7.3%.

Rate of confirmed AIDS higher 
among prison inmates than in 
U.S. general population

At the end of 1999, the rate of confirmed
AIDS in State and Federal prisons was 5
times higher than in the total U.S.
population.  About 60 in 10,000 prison
inmates had confirmed AIDS, compared
to 12 in 10,000 persons in the U.S.
population. In every year since 1995, 
the rate of confirmed AIDS has been 
higher among prison inmates than in the 
general population.

Methodology for source of data.
 
A greater percent of females than
males known to have HIV infection 

At yearend 1999 in State prisons, 21,431
male inmates and 2,300 female inmates
were known to be HIV positive.  Overall,
2.1% of male inmates and 3.4% of all
female inmates were known to be HIV
positive.  The rate of HIV infection was
higher among females than among males
in all regions and in most States.

Among all States, New York reported the
largest number of male and female
HIV-positive inmates (6,240 and 760,
respectively).  The second largest number
of HIV-positive male inmates were in
Florida (2,439) followed by Texas (2,238). 
The second largest number of HIV-positive 
female inmates were in Texas (282) followed 
by Florida (194). Eight States reported no 
female HIV-positive inmates, and every 
State reported at least one male HIV-positive 
inmate.

In nine States more than 5% of all female
inmates were known to be HIV positive. 
In three States over 20% of all female
inmates were known to be HIV-positive --
Nevada (30.6%), the District of Columbia
(22.4%), and New York (21.5%).  In all
States fewer than 10% of all male inmates
were reported to be HIV-positive.

Because some States in each year did not
report the number of HIV cases by
gender, estimates were made for those
States to provide comparable year-to-year
data.  Based on yearly estimates,
between 1998 and 1999 the number of
HIV-infected females decreased by 150
(from 2,552 to 2,402); the number of
infected male inmates increased 130
(from 22,045 to 22,175).  On average,
from 1995 to 1999 the estimated number
of male State prisoners infected with HIV
increased 1.2% annually, and the
estimated number of female prisoners,
1.9%.

While the estimated number of both male
and female HIV-positive inmates in State
prisons has increased since 1995, the
percentage of male HIV-positive inmates
has remained relatively stable, fluctuating
between 2.3% and 2.1%, and the
percentage of female inmates has
decreased from 4.0% in 1995 to 3.5% in
1999.

by gender from the most recent year
when data were provided.
 
AIDS-related deaths in State prisons
have dropped by more than 75% since
1995 

The number of State inmates who died of
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's
sarcoma, or other AIDS-related diseases
peaked in 1995 and has been steadily
decreasing.  Between 1995 and 1999 the
number of AIDS-related deaths decreased
768 from 1,010 to 242.   These AIDS
deaths accounted for 8% of all deaths
among State prisoners, down from 32% in
1995.

Between 1995 and 1999, the number of
AIDS-related deaths in State prisons has
decreased by more than 75%.  With the
introduction of protease inhibitors and
combination antiretroviral therapies, 
there has been vast improvement in the
effectiveness of HIV/AIDS care.

Despite the sharp decrease, AIDS-related
illnesses are still the second leading
cause of death in State prisons behind
natural causes other than AIDS.

Among Federal inmates, 16 died from
AIDS-related causes.  For every 100,000
inmates, 12 died from AIDS-related causes.  
These AIDS-related deaths accounted for 
6% of all deaths in Federal prison.

AIDS-related deaths accounted for 
about 11% of all deaths in State
prisons and 6% in Federal prisons 
in 1999

In 1999, for every 100,000 State and
Federal inmates, 24 died from
AIDS-related causes.  The most AIDS
deaths were reported in the South (115),
followed by the Northeast (64).  Together,
these two regions accounted for nearly
two-thirds of AIDS-related deaths in State
prisons.

Florida reported the largest number of
AIDS-related deaths (52), followed by
California (32), and New York (26). 
Twenty-two States reported having no
AIDS-related deaths.

AIDS-related deaths accounted for more
than half of all inmate deaths in Delaware
(62%), and more than a quarter in Florida
(29%), Massachusetts (29%), the District
of Columbia (26%), and Nevada (26%). 

AIDS deaths as a percent of all 
deaths in State prison more than 
twice that in the general population
 
The percentage of deaths because of
AIDS was about 2 times higher in the
State prison population than in the U.S.
general population age 15-54.  In 1998
about 1 in every 8 prisoner deaths were
attributable to AIDS-related causes
compared to about 1 in 20 deaths in the
general population.

19 States test all inmates either at
admission or while in prison for HIV

Data on HIV prevalence rates are
reported in the National Prisoners
Statistics series (NPS) by prison officials. 
The quality of the information reported
may vary by the circumstances under
which inmates were tested. Circumstances 
range from testing all inmates to testing 
only upon inmate request. 

Each State, the District of Columbia, and
the Federal Bureau of Prisons tested their
inmates for HIV based on certain criteria. 
Most jurisdictions (50) tested inmates if
they had HIV-related symptoms or if the
inmates requested a test.  Thirty-nine
States tested inmates after they were
involved in an incident, and 16 States
tested inmates who belonged to specific
"high-risk groups."

More than 8,500 jail inmates HIV
positive

On June 30, 1999, when the last Census
of Jails was conducted, 1.7% of jail
inmates were reported to be HIV positive. 
Prior to 1999, a census of jails was
conducted in 1993.  While the number
infected has increased from 6,711 in 1993
to 8,615 in 1999, the percent of the total
jail population with HIV/AIDS has
remained stable (1.8% in 1993). 

In 1999, jails in the South held the largest
number of HIV-positive inmates, followed
by the Northeast (3,822 and 3,105,
respectively).

Together, these two regions accounted for
80% of all jail inmates known to be HIV
positive.

On June 30, 1999, the District of
Columbia had the highest percentage of
jail inmates known to be HIV positive
(7.6%), followed by New York (4.3%), and
Massachusetts (4.0%).

Nearly half of all jail inmates known 
to be HIV positive were housed 
in 43 of the 50 largest jurisdictions

At midyear 1999, 43 of the 50 largest jail
jurisdictions held 3,987 inmates who were
known to be HIV positive. New York City
alone held 1,165 HIV-positive inmates,
accounting for almost 30% of those
inmates known to be HIV positive in the
50 largest jurisdictions. 

The HIV-infection rate was highest in the
largest jail jurisdictions.  More than 2% of
the inmates in the Nation's largest jail
jurisdictions were reported to be HIV
positive.  In jurisdictions with 500 or more
inmates, 1.9% were HIV positive; in
jurisdictions with 250 to 499 inmates, 1%;
and among those jails holding fewer than
250 inmates, about 1%.

1 in 12 deaths among jail inmates
attributable to AIDS

Between July 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999,
78 local jail inmates died from
AIDS-related causes.  These 78 deaths
accounted for 8.5% of all deaths in local
jails. 
 
The number of deaths due to
AIDS-related causes was highest in the
South (47), followed by the Northeast
(26).  The number of deaths in these two
regions accounted for 94% of all
AIDS-related deaths.  Florida reported the
greatest number of AIDS deaths (15),
followed by New York and Georgia (both
with 11).  Twenty-eight jurisdictions
reported having no HIV-related deaths.  

AIDS-related deaths were the third
leading cause of death in jails.  Natural
causes is the leading cause of death (with
385 in the 12-month period ending June
30, 1999), followed by suicide (324). 

The rate of death in jails due to
AIDS-related causes is lower than that in
State prisons.  Based on the average daily
population of jails, the rate of deaths 
was 13 per 100,000 inmates (compared to 20
per 100,000 in State prisons).

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The National Prisoner Statistics series
(NPS-1) includes yearend counts of
prisoners by jurisdiction, gender, race,
Hispanic origin, and admissions and
releases during the year.  The series
consists of reports from the departments
of corrections of the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, and the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons.  Since 1991 respondents 
have indicated the circumstances under 
which inmates are tested for HIV and have
provided the number of HIV-infected
inmates in their custody.

Census of Jails

The 1999 Census of Jails included 3,365
locally administered confinement facilities
that held inmates beyond arraignment and
were staffed by municipal or county
employees.  The census also included 47
jails that were privately operated under
contract to local governments.

Excluded from the census were temporary
holding facilities, such as drunk tanks 
and police lockups, that do not hold persons
after being formally charged in court
(usually within 72 hours of arrest).  Also
excluded were State-operated facilities in
Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii,
Rhode Island, and Vermont, which have
integrated jail-prison systems.
AIDS in the U.S. resident population

The number of persons with confirmed
AIDS in the U.S. general population (age
13 and over) was derived from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, yearend 
editions 1995-99.  For each year the number 
of active AIDS cases in the United States
was calculated by subtracting the
number of cumulative AIDS deaths for
people age 15 and older at yearend from
the cumulative number of total AIDS
cases for people age 13 and older at
yearend as listed in the HIV/AIDS
Surveillance Report.

The rate of confirmed AIDS cases in the
U.S. resident population was calculated
by dividing the annual totals for 
individuals with AIDS by the population 
estimates for the U.S. resident population 
of individuals 13 and older.  

AIDS-related deaths in the United 
States

The number of AIDS-related deaths for
persons age 15-54 was derived from the
CDC, HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report,
yearend editions.  Deaths in the U.S.
population for persons age 15-54 were
taken from the CDC, Monthly Vital
Statistics Report, Vol. 42, No. 2(S); 
Vol. 43, No. 12;  Vol. 43, No. 6(S); Vol. 
45, No. 3(S); and Vol. 45, No. 11(S); 
and from CDC, National Vital Statistics 
Report, Vol. 47, No. 9; Vol. 47, No. 25; 
and Vol. 48, No. 11.

AIDS-related deaths as a percentage of
all deaths in the U.S. population were
calculated by dividing the national
estimate of AIDS deaths of  persons age
15-54 by the national mortality estimates
of persons age 15-54 in a given year.
