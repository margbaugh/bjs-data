Highlights
             
From June 2000 to June 2002, the number of Federal 
law enforcement officers increased 19% at ATF, 11% 
at Customs, and 8% at INS
             
*  Duties for Federal officers included criminal 
investigation (40%), police response and patrol 
(22%), corrections (18%), noncriminal investigation 
and inspection (14%), court operations (4%), and 
security and protection (1%).

*  Three-fifths of Federal officers were employed 
by the INS (19,101), Bureau of Prisons (14,305), 
Customs Service (11,634), or FBI (11,248). Ten 
other agencies employed at least 1,000 officers.

*  INS (1,447) had the largest increase in number 
of officers. Next was the Veterans Health Administration 
(1,263), which continued its program to expand firearm
authority to its entire police force, followed by the 
Customs Service (1,112), and BOP (748). 

*  Twenty-one States and the District of Columbia had 
more than 1,000 Federal officers. Texas (13,374) and 
California (12,315) had the largest number. New
Hampshire (77) and Delaware (95) had the
fewest.

*  Nationwide, there were 32 Federal officers per 
100,000 residents.  Outside the District of Columbia, 
which had 1,421 per 100,000, State ratios ranged 
from 79 per 100,000 in Arizona and New Mexico to 5 
per 100,000 in Iowa.

*  Women accounted for 14.8% of Federal officers in 
2002. Minority representation was 32.4% in 2002, up 
from 30.5% in 1998.  Hispanic  or Latino officers 
comprised 16.8% of officers in 2002, and African
American or black officers, 11.7%.
-----------------------------------------------

As of June 2002, Federal agencies employed more than 
93,000 full-time personnel authorized to make arrests 
and carry firearms in the 50 States and the District 
of Columbia, according to a survey conducted by the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). Compared with 
June 2000, employment of such personnel increased 
by about 6%.  

The survey found that approximately 1,300 officers 
were employed in U.S. Territories as of June 2002. 
No data were obtained on Federal officers stationed 
in foreign countries.

The officer counts include supervisory and 
nonsupervisory personnel with  Federal
arrest authority who were also authorized
(but not necessarily required) to carry
firearms while on duty.  They exclude officers in 
the U.S. Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, 
Marines, and Coast Guard).  Because of classified 
information restrictions, Federal Air Marshals and 
CIA Security Protective Service officers are also 
excluded. Overall, 67 agencies are covered, including 
28 offices of inspector general.

The survey was conducted prior to the enactment of 
legislation creating the Department of Homeland 
Security (DHS). See page 5 for information on the 
effects of DHS on the organization of Federal law
enforcement agencies. 

The largest number of Federal officers, about 37,700, 
performed duties related to criminal investigation 
and enforcement (40%). (See job function category 
definitions in the appendix at <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/
abstracts/fleo02.htm>.) The next largest categories 
were police response and patrol with 20,500 (22%) 
and corrections with 16,900 (18%). 

About 12,800 officers performed duties related to 
noncriminal investigation and inspection (14%). 
Smaller numbers had duties related to court 
operations (4%) or security and protection (1%).    

Major employers of Federal officers

Department of Justice agencies

In June 2002 the largest employer of Federal 
officers with arrest and firearm authority in the 
United States was the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service (INS), with 19,101. (INS functions were 
moved to the Department of Homeland Security in 
2003.) 

About half (9,830) of INS officers worked for the 
U.S. Border Patrol. The Border Patrol duties 
included the detection and prevention of smuggling 
and illegal entry of aliens into the United States, 
with primary responsibility between the ports of
entry. Border Patrol officers worked along, and in 
the vicinity of, the 8,000 miles of U.S. boundaries. 

The INS employed 4,529 immigration inspectors with 
arrest and firearm authority at ports of entry. 
These officers are included in the noncriminal 
investigation and inspection category. INS also
employed 2,139 criminal investigators and
immigration agents responsible for investigating 
crimes under INS jurisdiction and 2,603 officers 
with detention and deportation duties.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), the second
largest employer of Federal officers, employed
14,305 correctional officers maintaining the security
of BOP institutions and the 139,000 inmates in
custody. Their duties include supervising inmates,
searching for contraband, and responding to
emergencies and disturbances. (See Methodological
note #1 at <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstracts/fleo02.htm>.)
 
The FBI had 11,248 full-time personnel with
arrest and firearm authority.  Nearly all were
FBI special agents, responsible for criminal
investigation and enforcement. The FBI
investigates more than 200 categories of
Federal crimes including bank fraud, embezzlement, 
kidnaping, and civil rights violations. It also 
has concurrent jurisdiction with the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA) over drug offenses under the 
Controlled Substances Act. 

The DEA had 4,020 employees with arrest and firearm 
authority as of June 2002. These special agents 
investigate major narcotics violators, enforce 
regulations governing the manufacture and dispensing
of controlled substances, and perform other functions 
to prevent and control drug trafficking.    

The U.S. Marshals Service, employed 2,646 officers 
with arrest and firearm authority. The Marshals 
Service receives all persons arrested by Federal 
agencies and is responsible for their custody and
transportation until sentencing. With BOP assistance, 
it transfers sentenced Federal inmates between 
facilities.

The Marshals Service also has jurisdiction over 
Federal fugitive matters concerning escaped 
prisoners, probation and parole violators, persons 
under DEA warrants, and defendants released on bond. 
The agency makes more than half of all Federal 
fugitive arrests.

Other Marshals Service responsibilities include 
managing the Federal Witness Security and Federal 
Asset Seizure and Forfeiture Programs, and security 
for Federal judicial facilities and personnel. 
Treasury Department agencies

The U.S. Customs Service employed 11,634 officers 
with arrest and firearm authority, the most of any 
agency in the Department of the Treasury. This 
included 8,167 inspectors and 3,467 criminal 
investigators. Customs Service officers interdict 
and seize contraband, process persons, vehicles, 
and items at more than 300 ports of entry, and
administer certain navigational laws.
   
The Customs Service has an extensive air, land, and 
marine interdiction force as well as an investigations 
component supported by its own intelligence branch. 
Customs investigates violations of more than 400
laws related to customs, drugs, export control, and 
revenue fraud.  Like the INS, the Customs Service 
became part of the Department of Homeland Security 
in 2003.
  
The next largest employer, the U.S. Secret Service, 
had 4,256 personnel authorized to make arrests and 
carry firearms. About two-thirds were special agents 
with investigation and enforcement duties primarily 
related to counterfeiting, financial crimes, 
computer fraud, and threats against dignitaries.

Most other Secret Service officers were in the 
Uniformed Division. These officers provide 
protection for the White House complex and other 
Presidential offices, the Main Treasury Building 
and Annex, the President and Vice President and 
their immediate families, and foreign diplomatic
missions. In 2003 the Secret Service was moved to 
the Department of Homeland Security. 

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), employed 2,855 
special agents with arrest and firearm authority 
within its Criminal Investigation Division, the law 
enforcement arm of the IRS charged with enforcing 
the Nation's tax laws. 
 
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), 
employed 2,335 full-time officers with arrest and 
firearm authority. ATF enforces Federal laws 
related to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, explosives, 
and arson. In 2003 ATF became a Justice Department 
agency. 

Other agencies with 500 or more officers

As of June 2002, the Federal Corrections and 
Supervision Division of the Administrative Office 
of the U.S. Courts employed approximately 4,500 
probation officers, all of whom have arrest 
authority. (See the box below). A total of 4,090 
were employed in districts where the court authorizes 
officers to carry firearms while on duty.  

About three-fifths of the 3,135 officers in the 
U.S. Postal Inspection Service were postal 
inspectors, responsible for criminal investigations 
covering more than 200 Federal statutes related to 
the postal system. The others were postal police
officers who provide security for postal facilities, 
employees, and assets, and who escort high-value 
mail shipments.  

The National Park Service employed 2,139 full-time 
personnel with arrest and firearm authority in June 
2002. This included 1,549 park rangers commissioned 
as law enforcement officers. Additional rangers 
serving seasonally were also commissioned officers 
but were considered part-time and excluded from the 
BJS survey.

The Park Service total also includes 590 U.S. park 
police officers. These officers work mostly in the 
Washington, D.C., area, but are authorized to 
provide police services for the entire National 
Park System.

The Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) employed 
1,605 officers with arrest and firearm authority 
as of June 2002. This was nearly 5 times as many 
as in 2000 as the VHA continued its program to 
expand firearm authority to its entire force. The
VHA employs about 2,400 police officers with arrest 
authority at its 173 medical centers. 

---------------------------------------------
Federal probation and pretrial services
officers
                         
As of June 2002, the Administrative Office of the 
U.S. Courts employed 4,516 probation officers and 
673 pre-trial services officers.  These officers 
are employees of the U.S. district court and are 
appointed by the judge they serve. They are 
supervised by the chief probation officer or chief 
pretrial services officer in their district.  

Federal probation officers supervise offenders 
placed on probation and supervised release. They 
also conduct presentence investigations to assess 
the risk to the community of future criminal
behavior, the harm caused by the offense, the need 
for restitution, and the defendant's ability to 
pay restitution. 

Probation officers have statutory authority to 
arrest supervisees for a  violation; however, 
under existing policy, they are encouraged to 
obtain an arrest warrant from the court, which 
is executed by the Marshals Service.

Federal pretrial services officers investigate 
defendants charged with an offense and submit 
reports to the court with recommendations for 
conditional release or pretrial detention. They also
supervise defendants released to their custody and 
monitor compliance with release conditions the court 
imposes.

Pretrial officers do not have statutory authority to 
make arrests. They are required to inform the court 
and the U.S. attorney of violations which may result 
in the issuance of an arrest warrant, which the U.S. 
Marshals Service executes.  

If it is allowed in their Federal judicial district, 
probation officers and pretrial services officers 
may carry a firearm for defensive purposes while 
on duty.  Before doing so, they must complete 
rigorous training and certification requirements,
provide objective justification, and be approved 
to do so on an individual basis. The following 
districts do not allow any officers to carry a 
firearm while on duty:

California, Central
Connecticut
Massachusetts
Tennessee, Middle
Virgin Islands
Virginia, Eastern
Wisconsin, Eastern
Wisconsin, Western

The U.S. Capitol Police employed 1,225 officers to 
provide police services for the U.S. Capitol grounds 
and buildings. In 1992 Congress granted the Capitol 
Police full law enforcement authority in an extended 
jurisdiction zone covering the area immediately 
surrounding the Capitol complex.

The Interior Department's U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service employed 772 full-time personnel with arrest 
and firearm authority.  Nearly 3 in 4 were refuge 
officers, with duties related to patrol and enforcement 
of Federal wildlife conservation and environmental laws 
in the National Wildlife Refuge system.  The others 
were special agents, who investigate violations of
Federal wildlife protection laws and treaties.

The General Services Administration (GSA)employed 
744 officers in its Federal Protective Service (FPS).  
These officers perform security, patrol, and

Agencies employing at least 100 but
fewer than 500 Federal officers

Agencies with 500 or more officers employed about 
87,000, or 93%, of the Federal officers covered by

general, 12 additional Federal agencies employed 
at least 100 personnel with arrest and firearm 
authority.

The U.S. Mint, a bureau of the Treasury Department, 
employed 375 officers within its Police Division as

patrol services for U.S. Mint facilities, including
safeguarding the Nation's coinage and gold bullion 
reserves. The Interior Department's Bureau of Indian 
Affairs employed 334 officers to provide police 
services in Indian country. Many tribal governments 
also operate their own police departments. (See

The National Railroad Passenger Corporation, better 
known as Amtrak, employed 327 full-time officers 
within its Police Division. These officers provide
police response and patrol, and investigative 
services for the national railroad system. 

The Department of Defense (DOD)employed 327 officers 
in its Pentagon Force Protection Agency (PFPA).  The
PFPA, formerly the Defense Protective Service (DPS), 
was established in May 2002 to expand the DPS mission 
of basic law enforcement and security to provide
force protection against the full spectrum of 
potential threats through prevention, preparedness, 
detection, and response measures. 

The PFPA provides services to the 280-acre "Pentagon 
Reservation" and numerous other DOD activities and
facilities in the National Capital Region. To meet 
its new requirements, the PFPA is expected to expand 
to more than double the size of its predecessor. 

The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management 
(BLM) employed 235 officers with arrest and firearm 
authority. Three-fourths were BLM rangers, providing

Federal Law Enforcement and the
Homeland Security Act of 2002

On November 25, 2002, President George W. Bush signed 
into law the Homeland Security Act, creating the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), a new Cabinet-
level Department that will plan, coordinate, and 
integrate U.S. Government activities related to 
homeland security.  
 
The legislation creates a new Office of Inspector General, 
and transfers all or part of 22 existing agencies to DHS. 
(For more information, see the DHS website,
<www.dhs.gov>.)  Most  transfers had occurred by 
March 1, 2003, with full integration during the 
following months. Several agencies employing officers 
with arrest and firearm authority are now part of
DHS.  

The following are transferred as distinct entities 
reporting directly to the DHS secretary:

U.S. Coast Guard -- Transferred from the Department of 
Transportation. In times of war, or on direction of the 
President, the Coast Guard will still be attached to the
Department of Defense, U.S. Navy.

U.S. Secret Service -- Transferred from the Department 
of the Treasury.

In addition to agencies or components that report 
directly to the Secretary, DHS includes five 
Directorates:  Border and Transportation Security, 
Emergency Preparedness and Response, Information
Analysis and Infrastructure, Science and Technology, 
and Management.

The Directorate  of Border and Transportation Security 
includes the following:

Federal Law Enforcement Training Center - transferred 
from the Department of the Treasury.

Federal Protective Service - transferred from the 
General Services Administration.

U.S. Customs Service (except for some revenue functions)- 
transferred from the Department of the Treasury.

Immigration and Naturalization Service - The INS is 
terminated, and its functions are transferred from 
the Department of Justice.

Transportation Security Administration (TSA)- TSA, which 
was created in November 2001 and includes the Federal
Air Marshals program, is transferred from the Department 
of Transportation.  

The Directorate of Border and Transportation Security 
will include two major new bureaus with law enforcement
duties:  The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP), with about 30,000 employees, will primarily 
perform border protection and inspections functions. 
It combines Customs Service and INS inspection services, 
the Border Patrol, and the Agricultural Quarantine
Inspection program. CBP is directed by the Customs 
commissioner.

The Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement(BICE) 
will enforce immigration and customs laws within the
U.S. interior. Its 14,000 employees are comprised 
primarily of Customs Service and INS special agents, 
INS detention and deportation officers, the INS 
Immigration Litigation Section, and Federal Protective
Service (FPS) employees. Customs air and marine 
interdiction functions, and intelligence components of 
INS, Customs, and FPS are also included.

Immigration and citizenship services formerly handled 
by the INS will reside with the new Bureau of Citizenship 
and Immigration Services (BCIS). BCIS will report 
directly to the DHS Deputy Secretary.

The Directorate for Emergency and Preparedness 
Response includes:  

Federal Emergency Management Agency (formerly 
independent).  

Also affected by the Homeland Security Act:

Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) -- Law 
enforcement functions transferred from the Department 
of the Treasury to the Justice Department.  Revenue 
functions remain at Treasury.  Legislation incorporates 
the Safe Explosives Act, creating new ATF enforcement 
powers related to explosives. The agency name has
changed to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
Explosives, though ATF initials will still be used.

As of June 2002, agencies in the Justice (55%) and 
Treasury (23%) Departments were the largest employers 
of Federal officers with arrest and firearm authority;
however, the Homeland Security Act made the Departments 
of Homeland Security (38%) and Justice (37%) the major
employers in 2003
----------------------------------------------

Offices of inspector general

Twenty-eight of the 57 statutory Federal offices of 
inspector general (IG) employed criminal investigators 
with arrest and firearm authority in June 2002. Overall,
these agencies employed 2,860 such officers.    

Offices of inspector general investigate criminal

in 1996 to 19,101 officers in 2002, a 54% increase.
***Footnote 1: From 2001 to 2002 the Transportation Security
Administration conducted a major expansion of the Federal
Air Marshals program, training and hiring thousands of
offices to provide security on commercial airline flights.
They are not included in the BJS survey because of 
classified information restrictions.***  This included a
81% increase in Border Patrol officers, from 5,441 to 
9,830.

Training for Federal officers

A majority of Federal officers receive some or all of 
their training through the Federal Law Enforcement Training 
Center (FLETC). Among the exceptions are special agents 
with the FBI and DEA, who complete basic training at their 
respective academies in Quantico, Virginia.

FLETC, a bureau of the Treasury Department at the time of 
the 2002 BJS survey, became a part of the Department
of Homeland Security during 2003. It serves more than 70 
Federal agencies, as well as State, local, and international 
law enforcement communities. FLETC has an annual budget 
of nearly $200 million.

About half of FLETC training instructors are permanent 
employees. The remainder are Federal officers on short-
term assignment from participating agencies.  
  
The basic training requirements for Federal officers 
varied by agency and by position within agencies. 
Overall, FLETC offers more than 100 different
agency-specific training programs. 

Among major employers, classroom training for criminal 
investigators ranged from about 8 weeks to 22 weeks. For
patrol officers, classroom training ranged from 4 weeks 
to 26 weeks. Field training requirements ranged from 2 
weeks to 6 months for patrol officers, and as long as 2
years for investigators.

During fiscal year 1970, its first year of operation, 
FLETC graduated 848 students.  In its first full year 
of operations at its current headquarters location at 
Glynco, Georgia, more than 5,000 graduated. In fiscal 
year 2002, more than 32,000 graduated, including about 
2,600 State and local officers.  

In fiscal year 2002, 69%, or 22,000, of FLETC graduates 
attended training at Glynco. The FLETC Office of Artesia
Operations (OAO) in New Mexico graduated about 6,000 
students.  OAO was established in 1990 to provide 
training for agencies that have large numbers of officers 
in the western United States such as INS and BOP.  

OAO also provides training for Federal Air Marshals, and 
was impacted greatly by the terrorist attacks of September 
11, 2001, as the number of such personnel trained went
from four in the year before the attacks to about 5,000 
in the year following.  

In 1995 a temporary FLETC satellite training campus was 
established in Charleston, South Carolina, to train INS
and Border Patrol officers as these forces expanded. This 
facility had 959 graduates during fiscal year 2002. 

A fourth training facility is under development in 
Cheltenham, Maryland, and will be used principally for 
in-service and re-qualification training for officers 
and agents in the Washington, D.C., area. It is also the 
new permanent home of the U.S. Capitol Police Training 
Academy.

The FLETC also provides a wide range of training courses 
at export training sites around the country, as well as 
at foreign training sites.

During fiscal year 2002 Federal agencies with 500 or more 
FLETC graduates included the Customs Service, 5,529; INS,
5,239; TSA, 4,997; BOP, 2,978; IRS, 1,225; Secret Service, 
989; Marshals Service, 979; and ATF, 721.  

The INS logged about 53,000 student hours of FLETC training, 
nearly twice as many hours as the next highest total of
28,521, for the U.S. Customs Service.
