On December 31, 2001, 2.0% of State prison inmates and 1.2% of 
Federal prison inmates were known to be infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Correctional authorities reported 
that 22,627 State inmates and 1,520 Federal inmates were HIV
positive. The number known to be HIV positive totaled 24,147, 
down from 25,333 at yearend 2000.

Of those known to be HIV positive in all U.S. prisons at yearend 
2001, 5,754 were confirmed AIDS cases, up from 5,696 in 2000. 
Among State inmates, 0.5% had AIDS; among Federal inmates, 0.4%.

During 2001, 256 State prisoners died from AIDS-related causes up 
from 185 in 2000. Excluding States with incomplete data on AIDS-
related deaths in 2000, the total number of AIDS-related deaths in 
2001 was 222. This increase was the first since the peak of 1,010 
AIDS-related deaths in 1995. In 2001, 8% of State inmate deaths 
were attributed to AIDS, down from 32% in 1995.  Among Federal 
prisoners 22 died from AIDS-related causes, up 1 from 2000.

This report is based on the 2001 National Prisoners Statistics 
(NPS-1). Data from the NPS were provided by the departments of 
corrections in 50 States and the District of Columbia and by the 
Federal Bureau of Prisons. 

Number of HIV-infected prison inmates at yearend 2001, 
down from 2000

At yearend 2001, 24,147 inmates in State and Federal prisons were 
known to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
down from 25,333 in 2000. Among State prison inmates, 22,627 were 
known to be HIV positive; among Federal inmates, 1,520. 

HIV-infected inmates were concentrated in a small number of States.  
New York (5,500), Florida (2,602), and Texas (2,388) held the 
largest number of HIV-positive inmates. These three States housed
nearly half of all HIV-infected inmates in State prisons in 2001. 
HIV-positive inmates comprised 2.0% of the State prison population 
in 2001, down from 2.4% in 1995. In Federal prisons HIV-positive 
inmates comprised 1.2% in 2001, the highest rate since reporting 
began in 1991. Overall, the percentage of the total prison 
population with HIV decreased from 2.0% in 2000 to 1.9% in 
2001.  

Inmates in the Northeast had the highest rate of HIV
infection

In the Northeast 4.9% of the prison population were known to be 
HIV positive in 2001, followed by 2.2% in the South, 1.0% in the 
Midwest, and 0.8% in the West.  New York had the highest 
percentage of inmates known to be HIV positive (8.1%), followed 
by Rhode Island (4.4`%) and Florida (3.6%).

Four States (Vermont, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming) 
reported 10 or fewer HIV-positive inmates in their prisons. In 
2001 every reporting jurisdiction held at least one HIV-
positive inmate.

---------------------------------------------------------
Nine States reported that fewer than 0.5% of their
inmate population were HIV positive. 

Between 2000 and 2001, 28 States reported a decrease in the 
number of HIV-positive inmates. The largest decrease was 
reported in New York -- 5,500 in 2001, down from 6,000 in 2000. 
Seventeen States and the Federal system reported an increase. 
The largest increases were reported in the Federal system (up
218), Georgia (212), Rhode Island (58), and New Jersey (33). 

A greater percentage of females than males with
HIV infection 

On December 31, 2001, 19,868 male inmates and 2,145 female inmates 
in State prisons were known to be HIV positive. Overall, 1.9% of 
male inmates and 2.9% of all female inmates were known to be HIV
positive. New York reported the largest numbers of male and female
HIV-positive inmates (5,030 and 470, respectively). The second 
largest numbers of HIV-positive male and female inmates were in 
Florida (2,203 and 399, respectively), followed by Texas (2,169
and 219, respectively). Six States (Maine, Vermont, North Dakota, 
South Dakota, Hawaii, and Wyoming)reported having no HIV-positive 
female inmates. Every reporting State had at least one HIV-
positive male inmate.

In nine States more than 5% of all female inmates were known to be 
HIV positive. In three States over 10% of all female inmates were 
known to be HIV positive -- New York (14.9%), Rhode Island (12.1%), 
and Nevada (12.0%). New York (with 7.8%) was the only State with
more than 5% of the male inmates known to be HIV positive.

Number of HIV-positive male and female inmates in
State prisons declined during 2001 

In States that did not provide a breakdown of the number of HIV 
cases by gender, estimates were made using the data reported from 
the most recent year. Based on these yearend estimates, the number 
of HIV-infected females in State prisons decreased from 2,472 to 
2,212 in 2001. The number of infected male inmates decreased from 
21,894 in 2000 to 20,415 in 2001.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The estimated numbers of both male and female HIV-positive 
inmates in State prisons decreased from 1995 to 2001. The 
percentage of male HIV-positive inmates decreased from 2.3% 
to 1.9%, as the percentage of female inmates fell from 4.0% 
in 1995 to 3.1% in 2001.

Confirmed AIDS cases in U.S. prisons increased
during 2001

At the end of 2001, 5,754 inmates in U.S. prisons had confirmed 
AIDS, up from 5,696 in 2000. Among those with confirmed AIDS, 
5,228 were in State prisons, and 526 were in Federal prisons.  

Confirmed AIDS cases made up 0.5% of inmates in State prisons 
and 0.4% of those in Federal prisons. Of those known to be HIV-
positive inmates, nearly a quarter had confirmed AIDS.

The States with the largest number of confirmed AIDS cases were 
New York (1,160), Texas (859), and Florida (677). Combined, these 
States held more than half of all confirmed AIDS cases in State 
prisons. The Federal system held 526 inmates with confirmed AIDS. 
Seventeen States reported having fewer than 10 confirmed AIDS 
cases in their prisons; 4 reported having none.

New York (1.7%) reported the highest percentage of confirmed 
AIDS, followed by Connecticut (1.5%), Rhode Island (1.4%), and 
Massachusetts (1.2%).  In 18 States confirmed AIDS cases 
comprised 0.1% or less of State inmates. 
--------------------------------------------------------------

During 2001, 20 States reported a decrease in the number of 
confirmed AIDS cases. Maryland, with a decrease of 112, had 
the largest drop in the number of confirmed AIDS cases, 
followed by Florida (down 91).  Seventeen States reported an 
increase in the number of confirmed AIDS cases, led by 
Illinois, up from 84 in 2000 to 159 in 2001.

Because some States each year did not provide a breakdown of 
the number of HIV cases by type of HIV infection, estimates of 
the number of confirmed AIDS cases were made for those States 
to provide comparable year-to-year data. Based on yearly 
estimates, the number of confirmed AIDS cases decreased from 
6,295 in 2000 to 6,286 in 2001.

Rate of confirmed AIDS 3 times higher among
prison inmates than U.S. general population

In every year since 1991, the rate of confirmed AIDS has been 
higher among prison inmates than in the general population.  
At yearend 2001 the rate of confirmed AIDS in State and Federal 
prisons was more than 3 times higher than in the total U.S.
population. About 49 in every 10,000 prison inmates had 
confirmed AIDS, compared to 14 in 10,000 persons in the U.S. 
general population. 

AIDS-related deaths in State prisons dropped 75%
from 1995 to 2001
 
The number of State inmates who died of Pneumocystis carinii 
pneumonia, Kaposis's sarcoma, or other AIDS-related diseases 
peaked in 1995 and steadily decreased until 2001. In 2001 the 
number of AIDS-related deaths increased for the first time 
since its peak in 1995. Overall, after 1995 the number of AIDS-
related deaths was down 754 from 1,010 in 1995 to 256 in 2001. 
AIDS-related deaths accounted for nearly 9% of all deaths among 
State prisoners in 2001,down from 32% in 1995.

The introduction of protease inhibitors and combination
antiretroviral therapies produced a substantial improvement 
in the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS care. See Hammett and Harmon, 
"Medical Treatment and a Continuum of Care" in 1996-1997 Update: 
HIV/AIDS, STDs and TB in Correctional Facilities (July 1999, 
NCJ 176344).

Among Federal inmates 22 died from AIDS-related causes, up from 
21 in 2000. In 2001 for every 100,000 inmates, 14 died from AIDS-
related causes. These AIDS-related deaths accounted for more than 
7% of all deaths in Federal prison. 

Number of AIDS-related deaths increased in 2001

The number of AIDS-related deaths increased by 71 from 185 in 
2000 to 256 in 2001. Part of this increase can be attributed to 
Indiana and Texas reporting in 2001, but not in 2000. Excluding 
these States with incomplete data on AIDS-related deaths for 
2000, the total number of AIDS-related deaths for 2001 was 222, 
an increase of 37 from 185 in 2000.

About 1 in 12 deaths in State prisons due to
AIDS-related illnesses

In 2001 for every 100,000 State inmates, 20 died from AIDS-related 
causes compared to 15 per 100,000 in 2000. The most AIDS deaths 
were reported in the South (134), followed by the Northeast (68). 
Together, these two regions accounted for more than three-quarters 
of AIDS-related deaths in State prisons.

Florida reported the largest number of AIDS-related deaths (39), 
followed by Texas (32) and New York (28). Twenty-one States 
reported having no AIDS-related deaths.

Relative to the number of inmates, Delaware had the highest rate 
of AIDS-related deaths (98 per 100,000 inmates), followed by New 
Jersey (68 per 100,000), Florida (54 per 100,000), Maryland (46 
per 100,000),and Colorado (41 per 100,000).

The percentage of deaths due to AIDS is more than 2 times higher 
in the prison population than in the U.S. general population age 
15-54. In 2000 about 1 in every 12 prisoner deaths were 
attributable to AIDS-related causes compared to fewer than 1 in 
25 deaths in the general population.

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The National Prisoner Statistics series (NPS-1)includes yearend 
counts of prisoners by jurisdiction, gender, race, Hispanic origin, 
and admissions and releases during the year. The series consists 
of reports from the departments of corrections of the 50 States,
the District of Columbia, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 
Since 1991 respondents have indicated the circumstances under 
which inmates are tested for HIV and have provided the number of 
HIV-infected inmates in their custody.

AIDS in the U.S. resident population

The number of persons with confirmed AIDS in the U.S. general 
population (age 13 and over) was derived from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HIV/AIDS Surveillance 
Report, yearend editions 1995-2001. For each year the number 
of active AIDS cases in the United States was calculated by 
subtracting the number of cumulative AIDS deaths for people age 
15 or older at yearend from the cumulative number of total AIDS
cases for people age 13 or older at yearend as listed in the 
HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report.

The rate of confirmed AIDS cases in the U.S. resident population 
was calculated by dividing the annual totals for individuals 
with AIDS by the population estimates for the U.S. resident 
population of individuals 13 or older prior to 2000 and 15 or 
older for 2000 and beyond.  

AIDS-related deaths in the United States

The number of AIDS-related deaths for persons age 15-54 was 
derived from the CDC, HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, yearend 
editions.  Deaths in the U.S. population for persons age 15-54 
were taken from the CDC, Monthly Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 
42, No. 2(S); Vol. 43, No. 12; Vol. 43, No. 6(S); Vol. 45, No. 
3(S); and Vol. 45, No. 11(S); and from CDC, National Vital 
Statistics Report, Vol. 47, No. 9; Vol. 47, No. 25; Vol. 48, 
No. 11; Vol. 49, No. 8; and Vol. 50, No. 15.

AIDS-related deaths as a percentage of all deaths in the U.S. 
population were calculated by dividing the national estimate 
of AIDS deaths of persons age 15-54 by the national mortality 
estimates of persons age 15-54 in a given year.

BJS Deaths in Custody Collections

In order to implement The Death in Custody Reporting Act of 
2000 (PL 106-297), BJS has developed four data collections 
of death records covering the Nation's criminal justice 
custodial populations.  BJS began collection from local jails 
in 2000, and added State prisons in 2001, State juvenile 
correctional agencies in 2002, and State and local law 
enforcement agencies in 2003.  These new collections are 
conducted on a quarterly basis and provide BJS with individual 
records for each death. Records include data on the deceased's 
individual characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race/Hispanic 
origin), criminal background (e.g., legal status, offenses, 
time in custody), and the death itself (e.g., cause, time, and 
location, medical conditions and treatment). As a result, these 
new collections will provide the public with a richer source of 
data on such deaths, and on a more frequent basis.
