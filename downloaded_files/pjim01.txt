Highlights
         
From yearend 1995 to 
midyear 2001  --
*  6-month growth rates for all States combined 
dropped from 4.8% in the first half of 1995 to
-0.1% in the last half of 2000.

*  The rate of incarceration in prison and jail 
increased from 1 in every 166 U.S. residents
to 1 in every 145.

*  State, Federal, and local governments had to
accommodate an additional 69,074 inmates per year 
(or the equivalent of 1,328 new inmates per week).

In the year ending June 30,
2001 --
*  The number of inmates held in jail  rose by 
10,091, in State prison by 10,954, and in
Federal prison by 9,245.  In the largest 
State prison systems, the total number of
inmates declined: Texas (down 3,661), California 
(down 525) and New York (down 2,553).  Florida (up 774)
became the third largest system.

On June 30, 2001  -- 
*  Privately operated prison facilities held 
94,948 inmates (up 4.9% since yearend 2000).

*  Local jails were operating 10% below their 
rated capacity. In contrast, at yearend 2000 
State prisons were operating  between 100%
and 115% of capacity, and Federal prisons 
were 31% above their rated capacity.

*  A total of 3,147 State prisoners, down 
from 3,896 at midyear 2000, were under age
18. A total of 7,613 persons under age 18 
were held in adult jails.
 
*  An estimated 12% of black males, 4% of 
Hispanic males, and 1.8% of white males in
their twenties and early thirties were in 
prison or jail.
  
*  There were 113 female inmates per 100,000 
women in the United States, compared to
1,318 male inmates per 100,000 men.
---------------------------------------

At midyear 2001 the Nation's prisons and jails 
incarcerated 1,965,495 persons.  Prisoners
in the custody of the 50 States, the District 
of Columbia, and the Federal Government
accounted for two-thirds of the incarcerated 
population (1,334,255 inmates).  The other 
third were held in local jails (631,240).

On June 30, 2001, 1,405,531 prisoners were 
under Federal and State jurisdiction, which
includes inmates in custody and persons 
under the legal authority of a prison system
but held outside its facilities. The number 
under State jurisdiction rose by 0.4% -- the
smallest annual growth rate in 28 years -- 
while the number under Federal jurisdiction 
rose by 7.2%.  Mississippi (up 12.5%), West 
Virginia (up 8.7%), and Vermont and Nebraska 
(both up 7.7%) had the largest percentage
increases.  Twelve States had decreases, 
including New Jersey (-9.6%), Massachusetts 
(-3.7%), and New York (-3.5%).

At midyear 2001 local jail authorities held 
or supervised 702,044 offenders. Ten percent 
of these offenders (70,804) were supervised
outside jail facilities in programs such as 
community service, work release, weekend 
reporting, electronic monitoring, and other
alternative programs.

More than 1.96 million inmates were 
in prisons and local jails

On June 30, 2001, 1,334,255 inmates were in 
the custody of State and Federal prison
authorities, and 631,240 inmates were in the 
custody of local jail authorities. These data 
were collected in the 2001 National Prisoner
Statistics  program and the 2001 Annual Survey 
of Jails. (See Methodology, page 13, for 
description of data collections.)

Since midyear 2000 the total incarcerated 
population has increased 1.6%.  Including
inmates in public and privately operated 
facilities, the number of inmates in State 
prisons increased 0.9%; in Federal prisons, 
7.0%; and in local jails, 1.6%. At midyear 
2001, 7.2% of inmates were held in Federal 
prison, up from 5.1% in 1990. 

Between 1995 and midyear 2001, the incarcerated 
population grew on average 4.0% annually. During 
this period the Federal and State prison 
populations and the local jail population grew 
at the average annual rates of 8.6%, 3.4%, and
3.7%, respectively.

In the 12 months before midyear 2001, the number 
of inmates in prison and jail rose an estimated 
30,505 inmates, or 587 inmates per week. Since 
yearend 1990, the total custody population has 
risen by 816,793 inmates, the equivalent of 
1,490 inmates per week.

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail 
in 2001 was 690 inmates per 100,000 U.S.
residents -- up from 686 at midyear 2000. At 
midyear 2001, 1 in every 145 U.S. residents 
were incarcerated.

U.S. prison population rose 1.1% -- 
the smallest annual growth rate 
since 1972

Between July 1, 2000, and June 30, 2001, the 
number of inmates under State jurisdiction grew 
0.4%, and the number under Federal jurisdiction, 
7.2%. Jurisdiction counts include prisoners in
custody and persons under the legal authority 
of a prison system while being held outside its 
facilities. Compared to the previous 12-month 
period ending June 30, 2000, State prison growth
rates were significantly smaller (down from 1.5%), 
while the Federal prison growth rate was
down from 9.3%.

Average growth,
1990-2001      55,265        5.8

In absolute numbers, the total increase of 
15,472 prison inmates between July 1, 2000,
and June 30, 2001, was the smallest 12-month 
increase in the decade and less than a third 
of the annual average growth (55,265) since 
1990.

About two-thirds of the growth in the prison 
populations during the 12 months ending June 
30, 2001, was accounted for by the Federal 
system (10,258 additional inmates). During this 
12-month period, several States experienced
growth, including Mississippi (12.5%), West 
Virginia (8.7%), Vermont and Nebraska (each
7.7%). Twelve States experienced a decline in 
their prison population.  New Jersey had the 
largest percentage decrease (-9.6%), followed 
by Massachusetts (-3.7%), New York (-3.5%), 
and Kansas (-2.7%).

Since 1995, State growth rates have 
dropped, while Federal rates have 
increased

Since January 1, 1995, 6-month growth rates for 
all States combined have dropped sharply (from 
4.8% in the first half of 1995 to -0.1% in the 
last half of 2000). The 0.6% growth between 
January and June 2001 offset the decline in the 
last 6 months of 2000.  Throughout the entire
6 1/2 years, State prison growth rates in the first 
half of each year have been substantially larger 
than rates in the second half.

During this time, Federal growth rates rose 
dramatically, reaching a peak of 6.0% in the
first 6 months of 1999. Although the Federal 
rates of growth in the first 6 months of 2000 
and 2001 dropped to 5.4% and 5.1% (respectively),
the absolute increases in the number of prisoners 
reached record levels.  In the first 6-months 
of 2001, the Federal system added 7,372 inmates,
the largest 6-month growth ever recorded in the 
number of inmates under Federal jurisdiction.

------------------------------------
Prison incarceration rates
have risen sharply since
1990

The incarceration rate of State and Federal 
prisoners sentenced to more than 1 year was 
472 per 100,000 U.S. residents on June 30, 
2001, down from 481 per 100,000 on June 30, 
2000. (See Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear
2000, NCJ 185989.)  The overall drop reflects 
the impact of shifting to the 2000 decennial 
census population estimates.  Midyear
incarceration rates prior to 2001 were based 
on estimates from the 1990 Census of Population 
and Housing. Using newly released estimates 
from the 2000 Census, the revised incarceration 
rate for midyear 2000 was 470 sentenced
prisoners per 100,000.

      Estimates (in 1000's) of    Number of sentenced inmates per
      U.S. resident population    100,000 residents at midyear
      1990 Census   2000 Census   1990 Census  2000 Census
1999    272,876                       468

2001    277,737      284,797          484         472

Twelve States led by Louisiana (795 sentenced 
prisoners per 100,000 State residents), Texas 
(731), Mississippi (689), and Oklahoma (669),
exceeded the national rate. Three States -- Maine 
(126), Minnesota (131), and North Dakota (158) 
-- had rates that were less than a third of the
national rate.  The District of Columbia, a 
totally urban jurisdiction, held 592 sentenced 
prisoners per 100,000 District residents at
midyear 2001. The number of sentenced inmates 
in the District of Columbia dropped from 
7,904 at yearend 2000 to 3,388 at midyear 
2001, as a result of an ongoing transfer of
responsibility for sentenced felons to the 
Federal system.

Since 1990 the number of sentenced inmates per
100,000 residents has risen from 292 to 472.  
During this period prison incarceration rates 
rose the most in the South (from 316 to 532) 
and West (from 277 to 414).  The rate in the 
Midwest rose from 239 to 370, and the rate 
in the Northeast rose from 232 to 305. The 
number of sentenced Federal prisoners per 
100,000 U.S. residents increased from 20 to 
46 over the same period.

Privately operated prisons held almost 
95,000 State and Federal inmates 

On June 30, 2001, 31 States, the District of 
Columbia, and the Federal system reported a
total of 94,948 prisoners held in privately 
operated facilities. These private facilities 
held 6.8% of all State and Federal inmates, 
up from 6.5% at yearend 2000.

The Federal system (with 18,185 inmates in 
private facilities), Texas (with 17,746),
and Oklahoma (with 7,023) reported the largest 
number at midyear 2001.  Four States   New 
Mexico (45%), Alaska (34%), Montana (30%), 
and Oklahoma (30%) -- and the District of 
Columbia (47%) had at least 30% of their 
prisoners in private facilities. Except for
Wisconsin (with 20% of its State inmates in 
private facilities) and New Jersey (with
9%), the use of private facilities was 
concentrated among Southern and Western
States.
---------------------------------------

Four States have more than 20% of 
their inmates held in other States or 
in Federal facilities

On June 30, 2001, 11,800 State prisoners 
nationwide had been placed in other States or
in Federal facilities   representing about 
0.9% of all State prisoners.  In addition to
housing inmates out of State to ease prison 
crowding, State correctional authorities often
house inmates under an interstate compact. Such
inmates may be housed in other States because 
of special security needs (e.g., for safekeeping 
from other inmates) or special inmate needs (e.g., 
housing inmates closer to their families).

At midyear 2001 Wisconsin placed the most inmates
(4,526), followed by Hawaii (1,225), Alaska (777) 
and Connecticut (657).  Vermont (24.3%), Hawaii 
(22.6%), Wyoming (22.6%), and Wisconsin (21.6%) had 
more than 20% of their prison population housed in 
facilities out of State or in the Federal system.     

Female prisoner population has 
more than doubled since 1990

From July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2001, the number 
of women under the jurisdiction of State and 
Federal prison authorities grew from 93,681 to 
94,336, an increase of 0.7%. The number of men 
rose 1.1%, from 1,296,378 to 1,311,195. At midyear 
2001 California, Texas, and the Federal systems 
housed nearly 4 of every 10 female inmates.

Since 1990 the annual rate of growth of female 
inmates has averaged 7.5%, higher than the 5.7% 
average increase of male inmates. While the
number of male prisoners has grown 80% since 
1990, the number of female prisoners has 
increased 114%.  By June 30, 2001, women 
accounted for 6.7% of all prisoners, up from 
5.7% in 1990.
   
Relative to their number in the U.S. resident 
population, men were about  15 times more
likely than women to be in a State or Federal 
prison.  On  June 30, 2001, the rate for
inmates serving a sentence of more than 1 year 
was 59 female inmates per 100,000 women in the 
United States, compared to 900 sentenced male 
inmates per 100,000 men.

Number of State inmates
under age 18 declining

A total of 3,147 State prisoners were under 
age 18 on June 30, 2001, down from 3,896 at
midyear 2000.  Overall, fewer than 1% of State 
inmates were under age 18. 

Florida (with 395) and Connecticut (with 330)
reported the largest number of prisoners under 
age 18 at midyear 2001, followed by New 
York (254), North Carolina (212), and 
Texas (208).  Except for South Carolina, 
all of the States with 100 or more inmates 
under the age of 18 at midyear 2000
reported the decline in their populations 
during 12 months ending June 30, 2001. Five
States reported increases   New Hampshire 
(from 0 to 4), New Jersey (from 20 to 28),
Delaware (from 19 to 26), Alaska (9 to 16) 
and Idaho (4 to 8).

Ohio                      81       106      -23.6

Among States, Louisiana had the 
highest prison incarceration rate; 
Maine, the lowest

At midyear 2001 the 10 jurisdictions with the 
largest prison populations had under their 
jurisdiction 844,535 inmates, or 60% of the
Nation's total prison population. Texas 
(164,465), California (163,965) and the Federal 
system (152,788) accounted for a third of the
population.  The 10 States with the smallest 
prison populations held a total of 25,701 
inmates, 1.8% of the Nation's total prison 
population. 

Louisiana had the highest prison incarceration 
rate (795 sentenced inmates per 100,000 residents), 
followed by Texas (731), Mississippi (689), and 
Oklahoma (669). Five States had prison incar-
ceration rates below 200, led by Maine (126), 
Minnesota (131), and North Dakota (158).

Growth slows as rising State prison 
releases outpace admissions

Underlying the dramatic slowdown in the rate 
of growth in State prison populations has
been a rise in prison releases. During 2000, 
570,966 sentenced prisoners were released 
from State prisons, up from 526,905 in 1998-- 
an increase of 8.4%.  At the same time, total 
admissions to State prison rose by 1.7% (from
572,779 in 1998 to 582,232 in 2000).

In 37 of the 44 States reporting comparable 
data the difference between annual admissions
and releases was reduced. In 11 States the 
number of releases increased while admissions 
dropped; in 18 States releases increased faster 
than admissions; and in 8 States releases 
decreased more slowly than admissions. 
 
Overall, State prison release rates dropped 
from 37 per 100 inmates in 1990 to 31 per 100
in 1995 and then remained nearly unchanged 
(reaching 32 per 100 in 2000).  However, as 
a result of increasing total prison populations, 
the absolute number of releases increased 25% 
(from 455,139 in 1995 to 570,966 in 2000). 
(See Prisoners in 1999, NCJ 183476.)

Prior to 1998 growth in prison admissions 
reflected increasing numbers of offenders 
returning for parole violations. Between 1990 
and 1998, the number of returned parole 
violators increased 54% (from 133,870 to 
206,751), while the number of new court
commitments increased 7% (from 323,069 to 
347,270). The number of parole violators
returned to prison in 2000 totaled 203,569; 
the number of new court commitments,
350,431.  (See Trends in State Parole, 
1990-2000, NCJ 184735.)

*Based on inmates with a sentence of more  
than 1 year.

At midyear the Nation's jails
supervised 702,044 persons

As defined in this report, jails are locally 
operated correctional facilities that
confine persons before or after adjudication.  
Inmates sentenced to jail usually have
a sentence of 1 year or less, but jails also 
incarcerate persons in a wide variety of other
categories.  (See box below.)

Based on the 2001 Annual Survey of Jails, the 
Nation's local jails held or supervised
702,044 offenders on June 29, 2001.  Jail 
authorities supervised 10% of these offenders 
(70,804) in alternative programs outside the 
jail facilities.  A total of 631,240 persons 
were housed in local jails.

------------------------------------
Jails --

*  receive individuals pending
arraignment and hold them
awaiting trial, conviction, or
sentencing

*  readmit probation, parole,
and bail-bond violators and
absconders

*  temporarily detain juveniles
pending transfer to juvenile
authorities

*  hold mentally ill persons
pending their movement to
appropriate health facilities

*  hold individuals for the
military, for protective custody,
for contempt, and for the
courts as witnesses

*  release convicted inmates to
the community upon
completion of sentence

*  transfer inmates to Federal,
State, or other authorities

*  house inmates for Federal,
State, or other authorities
because of crowding of their
facilities

*  sometimes operate
community- based programs
as alternatives to incarceration

*  hold inmates sentenced to
short terms (generally under 1
year).
---------------------------------------

Among persons under community supervision by 
jail staff in 2001, nearly 25% were required 
to perform community service (17,561) and 20% 
to participate in a weekend reporting program 
(14,381). Fourteen percent of offenders in the 
community were under electronic monitoring; 9% 
were under other pretrial supervision; 7% were 
in a drug, alcohol, mental health, or other 
type of medical treatment program; and 7% were 
in a work release or other alternative work 
program.

Number of jail inmates rose 10,100 
in 12 months ending June 29, 2001 

Between July 1, 2000, and June 29, 2001, the 
number of persons held in local jail facilities 
grew 1.6% -- from 621,149 to 631,240. The 12-
month increase was well below the average growth
(3.7%) from midyear 1995 to midyear 2001. The 
1.6% growth in 2001 was the smallest annual 
increase in the last decade.  In absolute
numbers, the total increase of 10,091 inmates 
in 2001 was less than the increase in 2000

continue to rise

Since 1990 the Nation's jail population on a 
per capita basis has increased over a third.  
During this period the number of jail inmates 
per 100,000 residents rose from 163 to 222.

1990           405,320        163

When offenders under community supervision 
by jail authorities are included with those 
in custody, the rate was 247 offenders per 
100,000 U.S. residents at midyear 2001.

A total of 7,613 persons under age 18 were 
housed in adult jails on June 30, 2001 
Eighty-nine percent of these young inmates 
had been convicted or were being held for 
trial as adults in criminal court.  

The average daily population for the year 
ending June 30, 2001, was 625,966, an 
increase of 1.2% from 2000 and 22.8% from 
1995.

Characteristics of jail inmates
changing slowly

Male inmates made up 88.4% of the local jail 
inmate population at midyear 2001- over 2 
percentage points lower than at midyear 1990.  
During the 12-month period ending June 29, 
2001, the number of female inmates rose 3.1%,
while the percent of male inmates rose 1.5%.  
On average the adult female jail population 
has grown 6.3% annually since 1990, while the
adult male inmate population has grown 3.8%. 

At midyear 2001 a majority of local jail 
inmates were black or Hispanic.  White
non-Hispanics made up 43.0% of the jail 
population; black non-Hispanics, 40.6%;
Hispanics, 14.7%; and other races (Asians, 
Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and 
Alaska Natives), 1.6%.

Relative to their number of U.S. residents, 
men were nearly 8 times more likely than
women to have been held in a local jail on 
June 29, 2001. Black non-Hispanics were 5
times more likely than white non-Hispanics, 
over 21/2 times more likely than Hispanics,
and 11 times more likely than persons of 
other races to have been in jail.

On June 29, 2001, an estimated 58.5% of the
Nation's adult jail inmates were awaiting court 
action on their current charge. An estimated
258,700 adults held in local jails were serving 
a sentence in jail, awaiting sentencing, or
serving time for a probation or parole violation.

At midyear 2001, 90% of jail
capacity was occupied

In the 12 months ending June 29, 2001, more 
beds than inmates were added to the Nation's 
jails.  At midyear 2001 the rated capacity of 
the Nation's local jails was estimated at 
699,309, an increase of 21,522 in 12 months. 

Rated capacity is the maximum number of beds 
or inmates allocated by State or local rating 
officials to each jail facility. The growth 
in jail capacity during the 12-month period 
ending on June 29, 2001, was less than the
average growth of 25,591 beds every 12 months 
since midyear 1995, and was less than the 
growth in beds during 2000 (25,466). 

As of June 29, 2001, 90% of the local jail 
capacity was occupied.**Note: On December 31, 
2000, State prisons were operating between 
100% and 115% of capacity, while Federal 
prisons were operating at 31% above capacity.  
See Prisoners in 2000, August 2001, NCJ
188207.**  As a ratio of all inmates housed 
in jail facilities to total capacity, the
percentage occupied decreased by 14 percentage
points from 1990 to 2001. At midyear 1990 
local jails operated at 4% above their rated 
capacity.

Jail jurisdictions that on average held 
between 500-999 inmates reported the highest
occupancy rates.  At midyear 2001 occupancy 
was 90% of rated capacity in jail
jurisdictions with an average daily population 
of 1,000 or more inmates, compared to 67% in 
those with fewer than 50 inmates.

The 50 largest jail jurisdictions 
housed a third of all jail inmates 

On June 29, 2001, the Nation's 50 largest 
jail jurisdictions held 32.6% (205,875) of 
all jail inmates. Twenty-two States had at 
least one jurisdiction which ranked in the 
top 50 for average daily population. States 
with more than one jurisdiction among the 
Nation's 50 largest jurisdictions are 
California (10), Florida (7), Texas (7), 
Georgia (3), Ohio (3), Pennsylvania (3), and 
Tennessee (2).

The two jurisdictions with the most inmates, 
Los Angeles County and New York City,
together held approximately 34,200 inmates, or 
5.4% of the national total.  

Twenty-three jurisdictions among the 50 largest
experienced a decrease in the number of inmates 
held between July 1, 2000, and June 29, 2001.  
Jurisdictions with the largest decreases
were Oklahoma County, Oklahoma (down 22.4%),
Harris County, Texas (down 21.1%), Tarrant 
County, Texas (down 16.6%), Shelby County,
Tennessee (down 13.0%), and San Diego County, 
California (down 10.2%).

The jurisdiction with the largest increase 
in jail population was Reeves County, Texas, 
whose population was up 75.7% and whose rated 
capacity increased by 87.1% (as a result of a 
new addition to the jail).  Other jail 
jurisdictions with substantial population
increases were Essex County, New Jersey (up 
21.2%), King County, Washington (up 17.0%), 
and York County, Pennsylvania (up 16.0%).  

Nineteen of the 50 largest jail jurisdictions 
operated at over 100% of their rated capacity. 
On June 29, 2001, Clark County, Nevada, operated 
at 171% of their capacity; Franklin County, 
Ohio, operated at 143%; and Maricopa County, 
Arizona, operated at 134% of capacity.

An estimated 12% of black males 
in their twenties and early thirties 
were in prison or jail in 2001

When total incarceration rates are estimated 
separately by age group, black males in their
twenties and thirties are found to have high 
rates relative to other groups. Among the more 
than 1.96 million offenders incarcerated on
June 30, 2001, an estimated 601,800 were black 
males between the ages of 20 and 39.

Expressed in terms of percentages, 13.4% of 
black non-Hispanic males age 25 to 29 were in 
prison or jail, compared to 4.1% of Hispanic
males and about 1.8% of white males in the same 
age group. 

Although incarceration rates drop with age, 
the percentage of black males age 45 to 54 in
prison or jail in 2001 was an estimated 3.4% -- 
nearly twice the highest rate (1.9%) among
white males (age 30 to 34).

Female incarceration rates, though significantly 
lower than male rates at every age, reveal
similar racial and ethnic disparities.  Black
non-Hispanic females (with a prison and jail rate 
of 380 per 100,000) were 3 times more likely than 
Hispanic females (119 per 100,000) and 5 1/2
times more likely than white females (67 
per 100,000) to be incarcerated in 2001.  
These differences among white, black, and 
Hispanic females were consistent across all 
age groups.

Among black non-Hispanic females, the rate 
was highest (1,389 per 100,000) among those 
age 30 to 34. This rate was only slightly 
lower than the highest rate among white 
males (1,934 per 100,000). 

Black incarceration rate highest 
in Wisconsin; Hispanic rate highest 
in New Hampshire

Louisiana led the Nation at midyear 2001 with 
1,013 prison and jail inmates per 100,000 State 
residents, followed by Texas (966) and Georgia 
(952) (table 16). Maine (222), Minnesota (225),
and Vermont (226) held the fewest inmates 
relative to their State populations.

When incarceration rates by State are estimated 
separately by gender, race, and Hispanic origin, 
male rates are found to be 11 1/2  times higher 
than female rates; black rates 6 times higher 
than white rates; and Hispanic rates 2 times
higher than white rates. The largest differences 
in incarceration rates between men and women are 
in Massachusetts (18 times higher for men) and 
Maine (17 times higher for men). The largest 
differences in rates between whites and blacks 
are in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Minnesota 
(approximately 13 times higher for blacks),
and between whites and Hispanics in Connecticut  
and Pennsylvania (7 times higher for Hispanics), 
Massachusetts and North Dakota (6 times higher).

Wisconsin led the Nation with an estimated 
4,058 black prison and jail inmates per
100,000 black State residents, followed by Iowa 
(with 3,302) and Texas (3,287). New Hampshire 
with 1,747 Hispanic inmates per 100,000 Hispanic
residents, Pennsylvania (1,680), and Connecticut
(1,434) had the highest Hispanic rates. 

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics (NPS)

The Bureau of Justice Statistics, with the U.S.
Census Bureau as its collection agent, obtains
yearend and midyear counts of prisoners from 
departments of correction in each of the 50
States, the District of Columbia, and the 
Federal Bureau of Prisons. 

In an effort to collect comparable data 
from all jurisdictions, NPS distinguishes 
between prisoners in custody from those under 
jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, 
a State must hold that person in one of its 
facilities. To have jurisdiction, a State has 
legal authority over the prisoner. Prisoners 
under a State's jurisdiction may be in the 
custody of a local jail, another State's 
prison, or other correctional facility such 
as a privately operated institution. Some 
States are unable to provide both custody and 
jurisdiction counts. (See National Prisoner 
Statistics jurisdiction notes.)

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined 
in locally administered confinement facilities 
who are under the jurisdiction of local authori-
ties. NPS counts include all inmates in State-
operated facilities in Alaska, Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, 
which have combined jail-prison systems.

Annual Survey of Jails, 2001

In each of the years between the full censuses, 
a sample survey of jails is conducted to
estimate baseline characteristics of the Nation's
jails and the inmates housed in these jails.

Based on information from the 1999 Census of 
Jails, a sample of jail jurisdictions was
selected for the 2001 survey. A jurisdiction 
is a county (parish in Louisiana) or
municipal government that administers one or 
more local jails.  The sample included all
jail facilities (948) in 878 jurisdictions.

In drawing the sample, all multi-jurisdictional 
(47) jails were included in the sample
with certainty.  These jails are operated 
jointly by two or more jurisdictions.  Other
jurisdictions (357) were included automatically 
in the sample if their jails held juvenile 
inmates on census day and had an average daily
population of 250 or more inmates, or if their 
jails held only adults and had an average daily 
population of 500 or more. 

The remaining jurisdictions were stratified 
into two groups: jurisdictions with jails 
holding at least one juvenile on June 30, 1999, 
and jurisdictions with jails holding adults 
only.  Using stratified probability sampling,
474 jurisdictions were then selected from 10 
strata based on the average daily population 
in the 1999 census.


Data were obtained by mailed and web-based 
survey questionnaires.  After follow-up
phone calls to respondents, the response rate 
for the survey was 100% for critical items 
such as rated capacity, average daily 
population, and number of inmates confined.

Survey estimates have an associated sampling 
error because not all jurisdictions were 
contacted for the survey. Different samples 
could yield some-what different results. 
Standard error is a measure of the variation 
among the estimates from all possible samples, 
stating the precision with which an estimate 
from a particular sample approximates the 
average of all possible samples. The estimated 
relative sampling error for the total number 
of persons under the jurisdiction of jail 
authorities of 702,044 on June 29, 2001, 
was 0.47%; for persons held in the custody 
of jail authorities of 631,240 was 0.43%.  

Estimating incarceration rates by 
gender, race and Hispanic origin

The number of prison and jail inmates by 
State was estimated for men, women, whites, 
blacks, and Hispanics. Estimates for midyear 
2001 were produced by combining custody data 
from the National Prisoners Statistics 
(NPS1-A) and from the 1999 Census of Jails.  
The following procedures were used:

Jail custody counts by State were estimated 
for 2001 using the certainty jurisdictions in 
the 2000 and 2001 Annual Survey of Jails. These 
jurisdictions (covering 71% of all inmates)
provide estimates of growth in 41 of the 45 
States and the District of Columbia that
operate local jails. In States without certainty 
jails regional growth rates were applied.

Estimates by gender were calculated by 
multiplying the gender distribution in 
1999 by the 2001 State jail totals and
then adjusting for the increase in percent 
female in 2001. The jail  estimates were 
then added to prison custody counts
(including inmates held in private 
facilities). 

Jail counts by race and Hispanic origin 
for 2001 were estimated using the totals
aggregated by State in 1999, converting 
them to percentages, and multiplying
by the 2001 State totals. The estimates 
were then adjusted for the changes in
race/Hispanic origin since 1999.

Estimates of prisoners by race and Hispanic 
origin were obtained by estimating
Hispanic counts in States reporting race 
counts only. The revised distributions by
race/Hispanic origin were converted to 
percents and multiplied by the custody
counts in 2001. 

Incarceration rates were calculated by 
dividing the inmate estimates for each
group by the latest available resident 
population data. For all inmates, State 
resident population figures were
available for July 1, 2001. For rates by 
gender, race, and Hispanic origin, State
population data were based on the 2000 
Census as enumerated on April 1, 2000.
