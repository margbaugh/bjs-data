"Note: National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) crime rates are normally reported per 100,000 persons but were recalculated for this report to align with the reporting of National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) crime rates per 1,000 persons. NIBRS violent and property crime rates are calculated per 1,000 persons. NCVS violent crime rates are calculated per 1,000 persons, and NCVS property crime rates are calculated per 1,000 households. See the FBI’s Crime Data Explorer [https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/nibrs-estimates] to review the confidence intervals associated with each of the NIBRS crime estimates. See Criminal Victimization, 2022 [https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/criminal-victimization-2022] (NCJ 307089, BJS, September 2023) for NCVS standard errors.",,,,,,,,

"c/NIBRS defines burglary as forcible entry, unlawful entry where no force is used, or attempted forcible entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft. The NCVS defines burglary as the unlawful or forcible entry or attempted entry of places, including a permanent residence, other residence (e.g., a hotel room or vacation residence), or other structure (e.g., a garage or shed) where there was a completed or attempted theft.
