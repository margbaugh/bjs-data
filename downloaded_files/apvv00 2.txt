Research shows that victimization rates 
differ by the age of the victim. In 
general the younger the victim, the higher 
the rate of fatal and nonfatal violence 
(rape, robbery, sexual assault, and assault) 
experienced. While this pattern is stable, 
the relative difference of victimization 
rates among the age groups and year-to-year 
changes in victimization rates experienced
by each age group is not.

In general the long-term trends for fatal 
and nonfatal violence are similar for people 
in most age groups.

Nonfatal victimization 

Prior to 1979, during most of the 1980's and 
since 1998, persons age 12-17 and 18-24 have 
been victims of nonfatal violence at similar 
rates.  For a number of years, 1976-2000, 
persons age 12-17 experienced violent crime 
at the highest rates, while for other years 
persons age 18-24 were victimized at the 
highest rates.

Persons age 12-17 and age 18-24 were 
victimized at greater rates than those of 
ages 25 or older each year, 1976-2000.

Persons in every age category except 
50-64 were victimized in 2000 at the 
lowest rates recorded since 1976.  

For persons age 12-17, nonfatal violent 
victimization fluctuated in the 1970's 
and early 1980's, and climbed beginning 
in 1987 to a peak rate in 1993. Since 
1993 rates have declined. 

Nonfatal violence against persons age 
18-24 increased to more than 100 
victimizations per 1,000 persons in 1979 
and in 1982. Following a period of 
relatively stable rates, they increased 
to the peak rate of 115 victimizations per 
1,000 persons in 1991. In general, since 
1994 the victimization rate has fallen.  

For persons age 25-34 the rate of violence 
fluctuated during the 1970's and early 1980's, 
peaking in 1982.  After a brief decline,
rates stabilized between 1984 and 1994. Since 
1994 rates have generally fallen.   

Nonfatal violence against persons age 35-
49 fluctuated slightly in the 1970's and 
early 1980's, reaching a peak of 47 
victimizations per 1,000 persons in  1981. 
Between 1981 and 1993, rates were relatively 
stable. Since 1994 rates have steadily 
declined. 

Nonfatal violence rates for persons age 
50-64 and 65 or older fluctuated slightly, 
1976-2000. Rates of violence against those 
age 50-64 were statistically similar in 
1976 and 2000.  For those age 65 or older, 
rates in 2000 were lower than those in 1976.

Homicide

In 2000 persons age 18-24 were murdered at 
a rate higher than all other age categories.  
Persons in this age group experienced 
homicides at the highest rates since 1986. 
Prior to 1986 persons age 25-34 were victims 
of homicide at the highest rate of all age 
categories. 

In general homicide rates for those age 35-49, 
50-64 and 65 or older declined steadily, 1976-
2000. In contrast the murder rate of persons 
age 25-34 increased from 1976 to 1980.  

Between 1980 and 1985 murder rates 
decreased, then rose from 1985 to 1991.  
Since 1991 murder rates of persons age
25-34 have decreased to the current 
rate - the lowest rate recorded for this 
age group.
   
The most dramatic change in homicide rates 
occurred for those age 18-24. Beginning in 
1986, the murder rate of persons age 18-24 
increased to the peak rate of 24 murders per 
100,000 persons in the early 1990's. Since 
1995 murder rates of persons age 18-24 have 
declined steadily. 

Homicide rates for persons age 12-17 remained 
relatively low and stable during the late 
1970's and early 1980's.  From 1985 to 1991, 
rates peaked and stabilized until 1995. Since 
1996 homicide rates have fallen and are 
currently at levels that were seen in the
1970's.
