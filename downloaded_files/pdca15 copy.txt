Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003
***************************************

****************************************
PREA Data Collection Activities, 2015
****************************************

The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA; P.L. 108-
79) requires the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to carry out,
for each calendar year, a comprehensive statistical review and
analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape. The act
further specifies that the review and analysis shall be based on
a random sample, or other scientifically appropriate sample of
not less than 10% of all prisons, and a representative sample of
municipal prisons.

In 2014, more than 7,600 prisons, jails, community-based
facilities, and juvenile correctional facilities nationwide were
covered by PREA. The act requires the Attorney General to
submit—no later than June 30 of each year—a report that lists
institutions in the sample and ranks them according to the
incidence of prison rape. BJS has developed a multiple-measure,
multiple-mode data collection strategy to fully implement
requirements under PREA.

****************************************************
DATA COLLECTIONS AND ANALYSES DURING 2014 AND 2015 
****************************************************

The Survey of Sexual Victimization (SSV), formerly known
as the Survey of Sexual Violence, collects data annually from
administrative records on the incidence of sexual victimization
in adult and juvenile correctional facilities. The first of a 
series of data collections implemented to meet PREA mandates, 
this collection began in 2004. The survey includes measures of 
five different types of sexual victimization and is administered 
to a sample of at least 10% of all correctional facilities 
covered under PREA. It collects additional detail on the 
characteristics of substantiated incidents of sexual 
victimization. 

The administrative records surveys provide a basis for the
annual statistical review required under PREA. The surveys
include all federal and state prison systems, as well as 
facilities operated by the U.S. Military and Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE). The surveys also include 
representative samples of jail jurisdictions, privately operated 
adult prisons and jails, and jails in Indian country. Each year, 
the SSV also includes all state-owned or -operated juvenile 
facilities and a representative sample of locally and privately 
operated juvenile facilities.

Results from the SSV for juvenile facilities are expected in
September 2015.

BJS published two reports in January 2014: Sexual
Victimization Reported by Adult Correctional Authorities,
2009–11 (NCJ 243904) and Survey of Sexual Violence in
Adult Correctional Facilities, 2009–11 - Statistical Tables
(NCJ 244227).

Among the findings--

* Administrators of adult correctional facilities reported
8,763 allegations of sexual victimization in 2011, a
statistically significant increase over the 8,404 allegations
reported in 2010 and 7,855 in 2009.

* The number of allegations has risen since 2005, largely due
to increases in prisons, where allegations increased from
4,791 allegations to 6,660 in 2011 (up 39%).

* In 2011, 902 allegations of sexual victimization (10%) were
substantiated (i.e., determined to have occurred upon
investigation).

* State prison administrators reported 537 substantiated
incidents of sexual victimization in 2011, up 17% from
459 in 2005.

* About 52% of substantiated incidents of sexual
victimization in 2011 involved only inmates, while 48% of
substantiated incidents involved staff with inmates.

* Injuries were reported in about 18% of incidents of
inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization and in less than
1% of incidents of staff sexual victimizations.

* Females committed more than half of all substantiated
incidents of staff sexual misconduct and a quarter of all
incidents of staff sexual harassment.

During 2014, BJS modified the SSV, implemented changes
for the 2013 collection year, and successfully completed the
2013 collection. BJS--

* revised the SSV definitions to synchronize the language
with the PREA standards (while preserving the ability to
measure long-term trends)

* added sexual harassment by another inmate as another
category of sexual victimization (to be consistent with the
PREA standards, 28 C.F.R. Part 115)

* added new response categories and expanded existing
categories to reduce responses reported in the “other,
specify” category

* added transgender and intersex as gender categories (for
gender identity of victim)

* expanded the sample of local and privately operated
juvenile facilities (from 330 to 530) to improve the
precision of annual estimates.

The National Inmate Survey (NIS) gathers data on the
prevalence and incidence of sexual assault in adult prison
and local jail facilities, as reported by inmates. The inmates
use audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI)
technology with a laptop touchscreen and an audio feed
to maximize inmate confidentiality and minimize literacy
issues. The first NIS (NIS-1) was conducted in 2007; the
second (NIS-2), in 2008–09; and the third (NIS-3), in
2011–12.

The NIS-3 was conducted in 233 state and federal prisons,
358 local jails, and 15 special confinement facilities operated
by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the
U.S. Military, and correctional authorities in Indian country.
A total of 92,449 inmates age 18 or older participated in the
survey, including 38,251 prison inmates, 52,926 jail inmates,
573 ICE detainees, 539 inmates in military facilities, and
160 inmates in Indian country facilities. The survey was
also administered to 527 juveniles ages 16 to 17 held in state
prisons and 1,211 juveniles ages 16 to 17 in local jails.

The first report from NIS-3 was issued in May 2013: Sexual
Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates,
2011–12 (NCJ 241399). During 2014, BJS issued additional
tabulations for this report—Supplemental Tables: Prevalence
of Sexual Victimization among Transgender Adult Inmates.
By combining results from NIS-1, NIS-2, and NIS-3, BJS was
able for the first time to provide accurate estimates of the
rates of sexual victimization among transgender inmates.

Among the findings--

*  An estimated 35% of transgender inmates held in prisons
and 34% held in local jails reported experiencing one or
more incidents of sexual victimization by another inmate
or facility staff in the past 12 months or since admission,
if less than 12 months.

* About a quarter of transgender inmates in prisons (24%)
and jails (23%) reported an incident involving another
inmate. Nearly three-quarters (74%) said the incidents
involved oral, anal, vaginal penetration, hand jobs, or
other nonconsensual sexual acts.

* When asked about the experiences surrounding
their victimization by other inmates, 72% said they
experienced force or threat of force and 29% said they
were physically injured.

* Transgender inmates reported high levels of staff sexual
misconduct in prisons (17%) and jails (23%). Most
transgender inmates who had been victimized reported
that the staff sexual misconduct was unwilling (75%),
and that they experienced force or threat of force (51%)
or were pressured by staff (66%) to engage in the sexual
activity.

* Among those victimized by staff, more than 40% of
transgender inmates in prison and jails said they had
been physically injured by the staff perpetrator.

The National Survey of Youth in Custody (NSYC)
provides facility-level estimates of youth reporting sexual
victimization in juvenile facilities. The first NSYC (NSYC-1)
was conducted between June 2008 and April 2009, and the
second (NSYC-2) was conducted between February 2012
and September 2012.

The NSYC-2 was conducted in 273 state-owned or -operated
juvenile facilities and 53 locally or privately operated
facilities that held adjudicated youth under state contract.
The survey was completed by 8,707 adjudicated youth
sampled from at least one facility in every state and the
District of Columbia.

BJS released the first report from NSYC-2 in June 2013:
Sexual Victimization in Juvenile Facilities Reported by Youth,
2012 (NCJ 241708). During 2014, BJS and Westat (the
NSYC data collection agent) initiated further analyses of the
NSYC-2 data to identify the key contextual and individual
factors related to youth sexual victimization. Analyses of
the NSYC-2 Facility Survey examine the impact of facility
and staff sizes, staff and youth composition, staff screening
methods, and security measures. BJS will derive additional
measures of facility-level characteristics from the youth
self-reports. These measures will include facility assault rates, 
fear of assault in the facility, attitudes of youth toward
staff, gang activity in the facility, and the nature and extent 
of inappropriate staff behavior with youth. The second report
will include a multilevel analysis of the relationships among
facility and housing unit characteristics, youth-level risk
factors, and self-reported sexual victimization.

During 2014, BJS and RTI International (the NIS data
collection agent) also initiated further analyses of the
NIS-3 data. Similar to the analyses of sexual victimization
in juvenile facilities, this work explores facility-level
predictors of inmate-on-inmate and staff-on-inmate sexual
victimization. The analyses draw on facility-level data from
past BJS prison facility censuses, the American Correctional
Association’s annual facility directory, and information
from the rosters provided by each facility sampled in the
NIS-3 collection. In addition, key facility composition
and climate measures are derived from the NIS-3 inmate
survey responses. BJS will issue a second report from NIS-3
that describes the contextual circumstances surrounding
sexual victimization and provides a multilevel analysis of
the relationships between facility- and individual-level
characteristics and self-reported sexual victimization.

In addition to providing a fuller understanding of sexual
victimization in adult and juvenile correctional facilities, 
the ongoing contextual research is mandated under PREA, in
Sec. 4c(3). The act requires the Attorney General to—

**use established statistical methods to adjust the data as
necessary to account for differences among institutions
in the representative sample, which are not related to
the detection, prevention, reduction and punishment of
prison rape, or which are outside the control of the State,
prison, or prison system, in order to provide an accurate
comparison among prisons. Such differences may
include the mission, security level, size, and jurisdiction
under which the prison operates.**

When released in 2016, the adult and juvenile facility
reports will address the differences and examine facility- 
and individual-level variations after these differences 
have been statistically controlled.

BJS RECEIVES 2014 POLICY IMPACT AWARD 
******************************************

On May 17, 2014, BJS and its contractors, RTI International,
Westat, NORC at the University of Chicago, and the
U.S. Census Bureau, received the 2014 Policy Impact
Award from the American Association for Public Opinion
Research (AAPOR) at its 69th Annual Conference in
Anaheim, California. AAPOR is the leading association
of survey research professionals. The Policy Impact Award
acknowledges that a key purpose of opinion and other
survey research is to facilitate better informed decisions.
AAPOR selected the PREA team for its outstanding work
developing a state-of-the-art multiple-measure, multiple-mode
approach that relied on both victim self-report surveys
and administrative records.

When the U.S. Congress passed PREA, it required BJS to
measure sexual victimization in correctional facilities. At
the time, there was little agreement on a methodology that
would generate accurate estimates. Both inmate self-reports
of sexual victimization and administrative documents
from prisons and jails were considered high risk for both
overreporting and underreporting of incidents.

The BJS-led team actively reached out to all stakeholders
as it developed protocols, measurement strategies, and
reporting criteria. The team established definitions of sexual
victimization that would hold true for each survey and
facility; addressed complex concerns, such as protecting
respondents from retaliation by other inmates or facility
staff; set statistical standards for defining high-rate 
facilities; and developed a plan for disseminating the findings.

The 14 separate reports on prison rape released by BJS
since 2004 have been extensively covered by the media,
researchers, and public interest groups at the local, state, 
and national level. The award citation states--

**The findings, and their extensive publicity, have triggered
special investigations by governors and state legislatures
and immediate changes in policies and plans of action.
Findings from the project are now cited extensively in the
training received by correctional administrators on how
to prevent and respond to prison rape. Without these
data, national standards for best practices to eliminate
rape and other related violence among prisoners could
not have been promulgated.**
