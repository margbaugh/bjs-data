Highlights

* Juries in the 75 largest counties disposed of
12,000 tort, contract, and real property cases
during the 12-month period ending June 30, 1992. 
Jury cases were 2% of the 762,000 tort, contract,
and real property cases disposed by State courts of
general jurisdiction in the Nation's most populous
counties.

* Most of the cases decided by a jury were tort
cases (79%). 

* The vast majority of plaintiffs (88%) in jury
cases were individuals.  

* Among jury case defendants, half were businesses
and less than a third were individuals.  

* Among jury tort cases, plaintiffs won in 74% of
toxic substance cases, 60% of auto tort cases, 41%
of product liability cases and 30% of medical
malpractice cases.  

* In about half of all the jury cases, the jury
found in favor of the plaintiff and awarded in the
12-month period an estimated $2.7 billion in
compensatory and punitive damages.  The median
total award for a plaintiff was $52,000.  

* Punitive damages were awarded in 6% of the jury
cases with a plaintiff winner.

* During the 12 months, juries disposed of 360
product liability cases.  Plaintiffs won 142 cases. 
Of the 142, punitive damages were awarded in 3
product liability cases.     

* Of the 403 medical malpractice cases with a
plaintiff winner, punitive damages were awarded in
13 cases.  In 4 of these 13 cases, the punitive
damage award was over $250,000. 

Over a year-long period ending June 30, 1992,
juries in State general jurisdiction courts in the
Nation's largest 75 counties decided an estimated
12,000 tort, contract, and real property rights
cases. Thirty-three percent of these cases were
automobile accident suits, 11% were medical
malpractice, and 5% were product liability and
toxic substance cases.  

Plaintiffs won 52% of the cases and juries awarded
these plaintiffs $2.7 billion in damages, of which
10% were punitive damages.  The average time from
the filing of the complaint to the jury verdict was
2.5 years.

These are some of the main findings from a study of
civil jury trial cases in State courts involving
tort, contract, and real property rights
claims--the three types that together comprise the
vast majority of civil jury trial cases. The sample
of civil jury trial cases excluded civil cases
outside the three types, Federal trials, trials in
State general jurisdiction courts outside the 75
largest counties, jury trials in State limited
jurisdiction courts and bench trials (trials by a
judge rather than a jury).

Over the year-long period ending June 30, 1992,
State courts of general jurisdiction in the
Nation's 75 largest counties disposed of an
estimated 762,000 tort, contract, and real property
rights cases.  Jury trials accounted for 2% or
about 12,000 of these cases (table 1).  (Estimates
for the total number of tort, contract, and real
property cases disposed of were derived from data
collected by the BJS Civil Justice Survey of State
Courts, 1992.  This survey consists of two
datasets.  The first dataset contains a
representative sample of the 762,000 tort,
contract, and real property cases disposed by State
courts of general jurisdiction in the Nation's 75
largest counties during the 12-month period ending
June 30, 1992.  Table 1 and the BJS Special Report,
"Tort Cases in Large Counties" (NCJ-153177), are
based on this dataset.  The second dataset consists
of a representative sample of the approximately
12,000 civil cases which were disposed by a jury
trial during the same period.  All remaining tables
in this report are based on this dataset of jury
cases.)   

Jury size and decision rules are determined by
State law and vary across the States.  For example,
28 States and the District of Columbia permit civil
juries smaller than 12.  Thirty-three  States do
not require a unanimous civil jury verdict. (See
appendix table 1.)  

Cases that reach jury trial

An estimated 79% of civil jury trials in the
Nation's 75 largest counties involved a tort
action, 18% were contract cases, and 2% real
property rights cases (table 2).  

Automobile torts accounted for 33% of all jury
trial cases, premises liability 17%, and medical
malpractice 11%.    Product liability and toxic
substance cases were 5%.

Type of litigants:  plaintiffs

The vast majority (88%) of all jury cases involved
individuals exclusively as plaintiffs (table 3). 
(Each civil jury trial case, regardless of the
number of plaintiff types involved, was given one
of four plaintiff designations:  hospital,
business, government or individual.)  Businesses
were plaintiffs in 11% of all cases; government
agencies 2%, and hospitals 0.1%.  Businesses were
more likely to be the plaintiff in a contract (36%)
than a tort (5%) case.

Note: Data for jury trial case types were available
for 99.5% of all cases.  Detail may not sum to
total because of rounding.  Data presented in
tables 1 and 2 are drawn from different samples and
therefore, exact case totals do not match.  See
foonote number 1 on page 2. *Data for toxic
substance cases, a specific type of product
liability case, were collected and reported as a
separate category. 
-------------------------------------------------

Type of litigants:  defendants

The composition of defendants in jury trials
differed from that of plaintiffs.  (Each case,
regardless of the number of defendant types, was
given a single defendant designation among the four
possible.)  Half the cases had a business as the
defendant.  Specifically, a business was the
defendant in all or nearly all of the following
case types:  toxic substance (100%), product
liability (99%), buyer plaintiff (88%), and 
employment (80%) cases.

Overall, less than a third of all cases had an
individual as the defendant.  Individuals were
about half (53%) the defendants in auto tort cases. 
Among medical malpractice cases,  hospitals
comprised 64% of defendants.  A government agency
was the defendant in nearly 29% of intentional tort
cases.

Who sues whom?

The most common type of civil jury case involved an
individual suing a business (44% of all cases, 44%
of tort cases, and 47% of contract cases) (table
4). 

Thirty-two percent of tort cases involved an
individual suing an individual, compared to 12% of
contract cases.  In nearly half (46%) of real
property cases, a business, government agency, or
other organization sued a corporation. 

Jury verdicts

Overall, juries found the defendant liable 52% of
the time (table 5).  (In civil cases, the plaintiff
must prove the key elements of the case by a
"preponderance of the evidence."  This standard is
less stringent  than "beyond a reasonable doubt,"
the standard used in criminal cases.)  The
likelihood of plaintiff success varied by the type
of civil case.  Plaintiffs won in 63% of contract
cases, 50% of tort cases, and 31% of real property
cases. 

In greater detail, plaintiffs were most successful
in toxic substance (74%), rental/lease agreement
(73%), and contract cases with seller plaintiff 
(71%); and least successful in mort-gage
foreclosure (20%), eminent domain (21%), and
medical malpractice (30%).  (See Methodology for
definition of case types page 11.)

Jury awards

Both tort and contract cases typically involve a
compensatory award for economic (sometimes called
special) damages, which include all financial
losses that are the result of  the defendant's
conduct.  Tort cases also can include a
compensatory award for noneconomic (sometimes
called general) damages, which include awards for 
pain and suffering and emotional distress. 
Distinct from compensatory damages are punitive
damages.  Punitive damages are almost exclusively
reserved for tort claims in which the defendant's
conduct was grossly negligent or intentional.

Juries in large counties awarded altogether $2.7
billion in compensatory and punitive damages to
plaintiff winners in 1992 (table 6). The median
recovery for all cases was $52,000. 

--------------------------------------------------
Jury cases with total final awards of $1 million or
more

Tort, contract, and real property cases disposed by
a jury trial in the Nation's 75 largest counties
during a 1-year period resulted in a total final
award of $1 million or more in each of 459 cases,
or 3.8% of all 12,000 jury cases.  In the vast
majority of these $1 million or more cases (97%) a
plaintiff, rather than a defendant in a
counterclaim, received the award.  

Medical malpractice (23%) and automobile tort (21%)
cases were the most prevalent types among cases
with a jury award of $1 million or more.  

The types of defendants in these large award cases
differed from those in torts with smaller awards.

Medical malpractice--

* A hospital was the defendant in 72% of the $1
million-plus cases compared to 56% of the cases in
which the plaintiff was awarded less than $1
million.

Automobile tort--

* Businesses (53%) and government agencies (29%)
together comprised over three-fourths of the
defendants in $1 million-plus cases. 

* An individual was the defendant in 52% of the
cases with an award under $1 million, compared to
18% of the cases in which the plaintiff was awarded
$1 million or more.
------------------------------------------------

About a quarter (22%) of the final awards to
plaintiff winners were in excess of $250,000.  Half
of the plaintiff winners in product liability cases
were awarded total damages over $250,000. 

About 8% of plaintiff winners received final awards
of $1 million.   The largest proportion of these $1
million-plus awards was in medical malpractice
cases (25%) followed by product liability cases
(15%).  

In tort cases, individual plaintiffs were just as
successful whether they sued an individual (53%) or
a business (54%) (table 7).  In contract cases,
individual plaintiffs won more often when they sued
an individual (69%) rather than a business (58%).  

Individual plaintiff winners received larger final
award amounts when the defendant was a business
rather than an individual.   When a business was
the defendant, the award amount exceeded $250,000
in 25% of cases.  When an individual was the
defendant, the award amount exceeded $250,000 in 8%
of the cases.

Punitive damages 

Juries included punitive damages as part of the
overall award in 6% of the cases in which the
plaintiff won.  (In 25 States, before punitive
damages can be awarded, the jury must find "clear
and  convincing evidence" and in 1 State "beyond a
reasonable doubt" that the defendant's conduct was
wanton, malicious, extremely or grossly negligent,
or oppressive in character.  Eight States require
plaintiffs to remit a portion of their punitive
damages award to the public treasury.  Twelve
States require bifurcation; that is, separate
trials for compensatory and punitive damages.  In
nine States that require bifurcation, the award is
determined by a jury and in the remaining three
States, the amount is determined by a judge.

Quiet Revolution Revisited:  An Empirical Study of
the Impact of State Tort Reform of Punitive Damages
in Products Liability,"  in Justice System Journal,
16(2): 21-44, 1993.)  

Punitive damages accounted for about 10% of all
money awarded to plaintiffs.  (Four States--New
Hampshire, Louisiana, Nebraska, and Washington--do
not permit punitive damages to be awarded and one
State--Massachusetts--permits punitive damages to
be awarded only when authorized by statute.  In
States that do allow punitive damages to be
awarded, many have enacted legislation to cap 
punitive damages at a specific   dollar amount,
such as $350,000.  Other States have capped 
punitive damages to a certain proportion of the
compensatory damages.  Source:  Koenig and Rustad,
1993.)  

The median punitive award was $50,000 (table 8). 
Twenty-four percent of punitive damage awards were
over $250,000, and 12% were $1 million or more.

Punitive damages were awarded to plaintiff winners
in 30% of slander/libel cases, 27% of employment
cases, 21% of fraud cases, and 19% of intentional
tort cases.  Six percent of plaintiff winners in
toxic substance cases and 2% in product liability
cases were awarded punitive damages.

Nearly 55% of the punitive damage awards in the 13
toxic substance cases were over $1 million.  
Employ- ment-related contract cases involving
punitive damages always included an associated tort
claim (for example, discrimination or harassment). 
Approximately $133 million in punitive damages were
awarded in connection with employment-related
cases.  The $133 million damages awarded accounted
for 50% of the total $268 million awarded for
punitive damages. 

In 43% of the civil jury cases which awarded
punitive damages to the  plaintiff, the punitive
amount exceeded the compensatory amount (table 9). 
In 22% of cases with punitive damages, the punitive
award amount was at least twice as much as the
compensatory award. 

--------------------------------------------------
Role of contributory negligence

In 13% of civil cases in which a jury awarded
compensatory damages to the plaintiff, the damages
were reduced because the plaintiff had contributed
to the negligence that led to loss or injury.  The
reduction totalled approximately $84 million. 
(This total does not include reductions in the 3
sites for which data on reduced awards were
unavailable:  Fairfax County, Va., Alameda County,
Calif.,, and Marion County, Ind.)

States differ in the role played by a plaintiff's
own negligence in determining whether, or the
extent to which, the defendant is liable for a
plaintiff's damages.

Based on these differences, States are classified
below into one of four categories.  (Whether a
State was classified as modified comparative
negligence, pure comparative negligence, pure
contributory negligence, or mixed rule depended on
general characteristics of its civil laws.  If the
focus were on specific types of civil cases, the
classification might differ from what is shown
here.  States do not always use the same decision
rules for each type of civil case.)
 
Modified comparative negligence  

Nine states have a modified comparative negligence
rule (the "50% bar to recovery" rule) which
stipulates that the plaintiff can recover damages
only  if he or she is less negligent than the
defendant.

Arkansas     North Dakota 
Colorado     Utah 
Idaho        West Virginia 
Kansas       Wyoming 
Maine             

Eighteen states use a modified comparative
negligence rule (the "51% bar to recovery" rule) in
which in the plaintiff can recover damages only if
he or she is not more negligent than the defendant.

Connecticut     New Hampshire 
Hawaii          New Jersey 
Illinois        Ohio 
Indiana         Oklahoma 
Iowa            Oregon 
Massachusetts   Pennsylvania 
Montana         Texas 
Minnesota       Vermont 
Nevada          Wisconsin 

Pure comparative negligence

Thirteen states use a pure comparative negligence
rule under which a plaintiff can recover damages to
the extent that the defendant is responsible for
the plaintiff's injuries.

Alaska       Mississippi 
Arizona      Missouri 
California   New Mexico 
Florida      New York 
Kentucky     Rhode Island 
Louisiana    Washington 
Michigan             

Pure contributory negligence

Six states use a pure contributory negligence rule
that bars recovering damages from the defendant if
the plaintiff's own negligent conduct contributed
in any way to his or her own injuries.  

Alabama     North Carolina 
Delaware    South Carolina 
Maryland    Virginia 

Mixed rules

Four states have a blend of rules that do not fit
into any single general category and are therefore,
classified as having mixed comparative negligence
rules.

Compensatory and punitive damage awards for
"defendants"

In cases with claims and counterclaims, the
distinction between plaintiff and defendant becomes
less clear.  Therefore, it is possible that one
party originally named as a defendant countersues
the plaintiff and actually wins damages.  In 1.2%
of all tort, contract, and real property cases
concluded by jury trial in State general
jurisdiction courts in the Nation's largest 75
counties during a 1-year period ending June 30,
1992, the defendant won in a countersuit.

Defendants in tort, contract, and real property
jury cases won  $162 million in compensatory and
punitive damages on counterclaims.  

Of these counterclaim cases won by defendants, 19%
were seller plaintiff, 16% auto torts, 14% buyer
plaintiff, and 12% fraud.

Defendants who won on counterclaims and were
awarded punitive damages comprised 4% of all cases
where punitive damages were awarded.  These
defendants were awarded $55 million in punitive
damages in jury trial cases.  Two-thirds of these
cases involved fraud.  The largest punitive amount
awarded in a counterclaim was $18 million to 11
defendants in a case involving negligence and a
contract dispute.
--------------------------------------------------
Product liability cases:   Jury verdicts and
punitive damages

In State courts of general jurisdiction in the
Nation's 75 largest counties, juries disposed of
360 product liability cases during a 12-month
period ending June 30,1992.  The 360 are about 3%
of the 12,000 civil cases (tort, contract, and real
property) disposed by a jury trial.

Juries decided in favor of the plaintiff in 41% of
the product liability cases and awarded a total of
$103 million in compensatory and punitive damages
to these 142 plaintiff winners.  In 3 of the 142
plaintiff winner cases, punitive damages were
awarded.  The total punitive damages awarded in
these three cases was $40,000. 

In 1991-92 juries rendered verdicts in 287 toxic
substance cases in the Nation's 75 largest
counties.  Plaintiffs won 74% or 202 cases,
receiving an average total award of over $500,000. 
In 13 cases punitive damages were awarded. 
Punitive damages totaled $26 million in the 13
cases.  (The court records did not reflect whether
the award was paid or whether an appeal was
entered.)  

The BJS survey finding that relatively few product
liability jury verdicts resulted in punitive damage
awards is consistent with previous findings in
studies of jury verdicts.  Findings from three such
studies are summarized below:  

* In a review of 24,000 jury verdicts in Cook
County, Illinois and San Francisco County,
California from 1960-1984, a RAND Corporation study
identified 6 jury trials in which punitive damages
were awarded in product liability cases.  Source: 
Mark Peterson,  A. S. Sarma, and M. Shanley,
Punitive Damages:  Empirical Findings (Santa
Monica, Calif.:  RAND Corporation, 1987).   

* Daniels and Martin (1990) reviewed  more than
25,000 jury verdicts in 47 jurisdictions from
1981-85.  They found 967 product liability cases,
in which 34 were awarded punitive damages.  Source: 
Stephen Daniels and Joanne Martin, "Myth and
Reality in Punitive Damages," in Minnesota Law
Review 75/1, 1990. 
 
* Using a variety of data collection methods,
Koenig and Rustad (1993) located 355 punitive
damage verdicts in product liability jury trial
cases across the Nation from 1965 to 1990.  Their
search focused on personal injury cases and did not

355 cases, 95 cases involved asbestos.  Source:

Case processing time

The mean case processing time from  filing of the
complaint to jury verdict was 30 months and the
median was 24.7 months (table 10). Toxic substance
and medical malpractice cases had a mean processing
time of about 3 years.  Product liability cases
took on average 2.5 years from the filing of the
complaint to jury trial verdict. 

County-specific data

The volume of jury trials, percentage of plaintiff
winners, final awards, and punitive damage award
amounts varied across the individual State courts
sampled in this project (appendix tables 2-3).

Many factors contribute to these differences
including State civil justice laws and the types of
cases disposed by jury trial.

Methodology

Sample

The sample used in this project is a 2-stage
stratified sample with 45 of the 75 most populous
counties selected at the first stage.  The 75
counties were divided into 4 strata based on
aggregate civil disposition data for 1990 obtained
through telephone interview with court staff in the
general jurisdiction trial courts.  In stratum 1
(14 counties with the largest number of civil case
dispositions), every county was selected.  Stratum
2 consisted of 15 counties with 12 chosen randomly. 
From strata 3, 10 of the 20 counties were selected.
Nine of the 26 counties in stratum 4 were included. 

At the second stage, for 38 of the jurisdictions,
all tort, contract, and real property rights cases
disposed by jury verdict between July 1, 1991, and
June 30, 1992, were selected. In the other 7
jurisdictions, a random sample of about 300 cases
or half the jury trial cases (whichever yielded
more cases) were included in the sample.  The final
sample consisted of 6,504 tort, contract, and real
property jury trial cases.

Sampling error

Since the data in this report came from a sample, a
sampling error (standard error) is associated with
each reported number.  In general, if the
difference between two numbers is greater than
twice the standard error for that difference, there
is confidence that for 95 out of 100 possible
samples a real difference exists and that the
apparent difference is not simply the result of
using a sample rather than the entire population. 
All differences discussed in this report were
statistically significant at or above the 95
percent confidence level.

Data recording and unobtainable information

For each sampled case, a standard coding form was
manually completed by court staff on-site to record
information about the litigants, case type,
pro-cessing time and award amounts.  

Information for which data were not available or
collected included the cost of litigation for the
parties involved, as well as for others, actual
disbursement of awards, the type and extent of the
personal injury, if any, and the number of cases
that were appealed. 

Final award and punitive damage amounts

Two ways of calculating averages are used to
describe final award and punitive damage amounts to
plaintiff winners.  Means are sensitive to a few
very large or small award amounts in a
distribution.  The median, the middle value in the
range of award amounts, is not influenced by
extreme values.  Median final award and punitive
damage amounts are nearly always smaller than
corresponding means.

Civil case type definitions:

Torts--Claims arising from personal injury or
property damage caused by negligent or intentional
act of another person or business,  Specific tort
case types include : automobile accident;  premises
liability (injury caused by the dangerous condition
of residential or commercial property); medical
malpractice (by doctor, dentist, or medical
professional); other professional malpractice
(e.g.. by engineers, architects); product liability
(injury or damage caused by  defective products);
toxic substance (injury caused by toxic
substances); libel/slander (injury to reputation);
intentional tort (e.g., vandalism, intentional
personal injury); and other negligent acts.  

Contracts--Cases which include all allegations of
breach of contract.  Specific case types include:
seller plaintiff  (sellers of goods or services,
including lenders, seek payment of money owed to
them by a buyer, including  borrowers);  buyer
plaintiff (purchaser of goods or services seeks
return of their money, recision of the contract, or
delivery of the specified goods delivered);
mortgage contract/foreclosure (foreclosures on real
property, commercial, or residential; because the
title to real property is transferred to the lender
if the claim is successful it could be included
under real property cases); fraud ( financial
damages incurred due to intentional or negligent
misrepresen-tation regarding a product or company;
also considered a type of tort claim, but because
it arises out of commercial transactions, it was
included under contracts); employment claim (claim
involving employment or hiring process, including
claims of employment discrimination; workman's
compensa-tion claims, handled primarily through
administrative process, are not included);
rental/lease agreement; and other contract claims
(including partnership claims, stockholder claims,
and subrogation issues). 

Real property--Any claim regarding ownership of
real property (excluding mortgage foreclosures,
which are included under contracts).  Specific
categories used include:  eminent domain
(condemnation of real property to obtain for public
use); other real property (any other claim
regarding title to or use of real property).
