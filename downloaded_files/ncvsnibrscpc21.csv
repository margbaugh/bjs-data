"Note: National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) crime rates are calculated differently. NIBRS-based crime rates are normally reported per 100,000 persons but were recalculated for this report to align with the reporting of NCVS crime rates per 1,000. NIBRS violent and property crime rates are calculated per 1,000 persons, and NCVS property crime rates are calculated per 1,000 households. See the FBI's Crime Data Explorer at https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/home for NIBRS standard errors. See Criminal Victimization, 2021 (NCJ 305101, BJS, September 2022) for NCVS standard errors.",,,,,,,
