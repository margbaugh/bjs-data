Highlights

From 1992 to 2000, the number of full-time
sworn personnel employed by State and local
law enforcement agencies increased by about
100,000, or 16%

*  As of June 2000, nearly 18,000 State and 
local agencies employed the equivalent of at 
least 1 full-time sworn officer with general 
arrest powers.  These agencies had more than 
1 million full-time employees, including 
708,022 sworn personnel.

*  The number of full-time State and local
sworn personnel nationwide in June 2000
was about 44,000, or 7%, more than in 1996, 
and about 100,000, or 16%, more than in 1992.

*  In 2000, State and local agencies employed 
more than 425,000 uniformed officers whose 
regularly assigned duties included responding 
to calls for service. More than 131,000 sworn 
personnel were designated as community policing 
officers.

*  About 15% of sworn personnel primarily
handled criminal investigations.  About 8%
primarily performed jail-related duties, and
3% handled court-related duties such as
providing court security or serving civil
process.

*  Seventy-seven agencies employed 1,000
or more sworn personnel.  This included 47
local police departments, 17 State police or
highway patrol agencies, 12 sheriffs' offices,
and 1 special jurisdiction police agency.  

*  The largest agency, the New York City
Police Department, had 40,435 full-time
sworn personnel as of June 2000.  The
largest sheriff's office, in Los Angeles
County, had 8,468 officers, and the largest
State agency, the California Highway Patrol,
6,678.    
---------------------------------------------------

As of June 2000, State and local governments 
in the United States operated 17,784 full-time 
law enforcement agencies -- those that employed 
at least one full-time sworn officer with 
general arrest powers or the equivalent in 
part-time officers.
 
The total included 12,666 general purpose
local police departments, 3,070 sheriffs'
offices, the 49 primary State law enforcement 
agencies, 1,376 State and local agencies with 
a special geographic jurisdiction or special 
enforcement responsibilities, and 623 county 
constable offices in Texas.

Overall, these State and local law enforcement 
agencies employed 1,019,496 persons on a 
full-time basis.  This total included 708,022 
full-time sworn personnel (69%) and 311,474 
nonsworn (or civilian) personnel (31%).  These 
agencies also had about 99,000 part-time 
employees, including nearly  43,000 part-time 
sworn personnel.

These findings resulted from the 2000 Census 
of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, 
sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
(BJS) and the Office of Community Oriented 
Policing Services (COPS).

The BJS Census of State and Local 
Law Enforcement Agencies

To ensure an accurate sampling frame for
its Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey,
BJS periodically sponsors a census of State
and local law enforcement agencies.  The
2000 census included State and local
agencies employing the equivalent of least
one full-time officer with general arrest
powers.  This report summarizes the
findings of the census, which was
co-sponsored by COPS.

As in 1992 and 1996, the 2000 census
collected data on the number of sworn and
nonsworn personnel, including both full-time
and part-time employees.  Data were
collected from agencies that employed at
least one sworn officer or the part-time
equivalent at the time of the census.  The
reference period for all data is the pay
period that included June 30, 2000.

State and local law
enforcement agencies

By type of agency, general purpose local
police departments were the largest
employer with 565,915 full-time employees
as of June 2000.  Of this total, 440,920, 
or 78%, were sworn personnel with general
arrest powers.  Sheriffs' offices accounted
for 293,823 full-time employees, of which
164,711 (56%) were sworn officers.

The 49 primary State law enforcement
agencies operating in each State except
Hawaii employed 87,028 persons full time. 
Of these employees, 56,348, or 65%, were
full-time sworn personnel.

Agencies with a special geographic
jurisdiction or special enforcement
responsibilities employed 43,413 full-time
sworn personnel and had 69,650 full-time
employees overall. (See table 14 for types
of special jurisdictions). 

From June 1996 to 2000, the number of
full-time State and local law enforcement
employees in the United States increased
about 97,500, or 10.6%.  The number of
full-time sworn personnel was up about
44,500, an increase of 6.7%.  Civilian
employment rose 53,000, or 20.5%.

In 2000 full-time employment was up
173,000, or 20.4%, compared to 1992.  
This included about 100,000, or 16.4%, 
more sworn personnel, and 73,000, or 
30.7%, more civilians. 

In June 2000 there were 362 full-time State
and local law enforcement employees per
100,000 residents nationwide, an increase
of 5.9% from 1996, and 9.6% more than in
1992.  This included 252 sworn personnel
per 100,000 residents, an increase of 2.4%
from 1996 levels, and 6.3% from 1992.  The
ratio of nonsworn personnel per 100,000
residents increased 19.4% from 1992 to
2000, including a 15.1% rise from 1996 to
2000. 

State and local sworn personnel

Fifty-nine percent of full-time State and
local sworn employees were assigned to
patrol duty on a regular basis.  About in 
1 in 7 sworn personnel were assigned to
investigative duties.  Approximately 1 in 
11 primarily performed duties related to 
jail (5.4%) or court (3.7%) operations.  
Duties of other State and local law 
enforcement officers, but not broken down 
here, included administration, training, 
and technical support. 

Size of agencies 

As of June 2000, of the 17,784 State and
local law enforcement agencies operating,
1,032, or 6%, employed 100 or more full-time 
sworn personnel.  This included 77 agencies 
with 1,000 or more officers.

The majority of agencies employed fewer than 
10 full-time officers (52%), and nearly a 
third, about 5,600 in all, employed fewer
than 5 (31%).  These smaller agencies
included 1,907, 11% of agencies overall,
with just 1 full-time officer and 231, 1% 
of all agencies, with only part-time officers.
 
Although State and local agencies with 100
or more full-time sworn officers accounted
for just 6% of all agencies, they employed
63% of all State and local full-time sworn
personnel.  The 77 agencies with 1,000 or
more officers accounted for 220,512, or
31.1%, of all full-time sworn personnel.  

The 77 largest agencies rarely used
part-time sworn officers, accounting for 
just 0.3% of all such personnel nationwide. 
Nearly half (47%) of part-time sworn
personnel were employed by agencies with
fewer than 10 full-time officers, and about
two-thirds (68%) worked for agencies with
fewer than 25 full-time officers.

State-by-State comparisons

Texas (1,800) had the most full-time State
and local law enforcement agencies.  The

(see box on page 14). Pennsylvania (1,166)
had the next highest number of agencies,
followed by Illinois (886) and Ohio (845). 

California had the most full-time State and
local law enforcement employees, about
116,000.  Other States with 50,000 or more

North Dakota (1,755).

Nationwide, there were 362 full-time sworn
personnel per 100,000 residents.  The
District of Columbia (859), Louisiana (527),
and New York (500) had the most.  West
Virginia (229), Kentucky (237), and Vermont
(240) had the least. 

California (73,762) had the most full-time
sworn personnel employed by State and
local agencies, followed closely by New
York (72,853).  Next were Texas (51,478),
Illinois (39,847), and Florida (39,452). 
Vermont (1,034) had the fewest officers.

After the District of Columbia (693), the 
ratio of full-time sworn personnel per 100,000
residents was highest in Louisiana (415). 
The next highest ratios were in New York
(384), New Jersey (345), and Illinois (321). 
The lowest ratios were in Vermont (170) and
West Virginia (174).  Nation-wide, the ratio
was 252 per 100,000.

The per capita ratio of uniformed officers
whose regular duties included responding to
calls for service were highest in the District
of Columbia (357 per 100,000 residents),
New York (240), and Wyoming (200). It was
lowest in Oregon (104) and Washington (108).  
The overall ratio for the Nation was 151 per 
100,000.  

Local police departments

As of June 2000, there were 12,666 general
purpose local police departments operating
in the United States.  Municipal governments 
operated the vast majority of these agencies.  
The remainder were county, tribal, or regional
(multi-jurisdictional) police.

As of June 2000, full-time employment by
local police departments was up  about
44,000, or 8.4%, compared to June 1996. 
The number of full-time sworn personnel
increased  about 30,000, or 7.3%.  The
number of civilian employees in local police
departments rose about 14,000, or 12.6%.

In 2000, the number of full-time local police
employees was up by about 87,000, or 18.2%, 
compared to 1992. This included about 66,000, 
or 17.7% more sworn personnel and about 
21,000, or 20.1%, more civilian personnel. 

Size of local police departments

A total of 567, or 4.5%, of local police
departments employed 100 or more full-time
sworn personnel. Included in these larger
agencies were 47 with 1,000 or more officers.  
In contrast, 56.2% of departments employed 
fewer than 10 full-time officers. Included 
among these smaller agencies were 1,366 (10.8%) 
that employed only 1 full-time officer, and 
199 (1.6%) that relied solely on part-time 
officers. 

Agencies with fewer than 10 full-time
officers employed about 6% of all full-time
local police officers.  About three-fifths
(61%) of all full-time local police officers
worked in an agency with 100 or more officers, 
and nearly half (48%) worked for an agency 
with at least 250 officers. 

The 47 departments with 1,000 or more
officers employed 34.2 % of all full-time 
local police officers.  These agencies employed
just 0.3% of all part-time sworn personnel,
but 27% of part-time civilian personnel.

Functions of local police officers

About 64% of full-time sworn local police
personnel primarily performed patrol duties,
while 16% primarily handled criminal
investigations.  This Included personnel in
other functional areas such as administration, 
training, and technical support with those 
responding to calls and investigating crimes.  
Nearly all local police officers were working 
in the area of law enforcement operations. Less 
than 2% had regularly assigned court-related 
(0.7%) or jail-related (0.6%) duties.

The largest local police departments 

As of June 2000 the New York City Police
Department (NYPD) was the Nation's
largest local police department -- and its
largest law enforcement agency of any kind
-- with 53,029 full-time employees, including
40,435 sworn officers.  Twenty-three NYPD
officers were killed in the line of duty as a
result of the terrorist attacks of September
11, 2001. 

Other cities with police forces of more than
5,000 full-time officers included Chicago
(13,466), Los Angeles (9,341), Philadelphia
(7,024), and Houston (5,343).  In 2000
about 1 in 11 full-time local police officers
nationwide worked for the NYPD, and about
1 in 6 worked for one of the five largest
forces.

The largest county police departments in the
U.S. included the Nassau County (NY)Police with 
3,038 full-time officers, the Miami-Dade (FL) 
Police (3,008), and the Suffolk County (NY) 
Police (2,564).  From June 1996 to 2000, the NYPD
reported the largest change in number of
officers of any State or local police department.  
During this period, the Nation's largest police 
force expanded by 3,622 officers.  

By percent change, the departments with
the largest increases were those serving
Memphis (34.1%), Las Vegas (27.8%), New
Orleans (24.0%), Austin (20.9%), and
Newark (20.0%).  Decreases in force size
occurred in Pittsburgh (10.2%), Honolulu
(9.5%), St. Louis (8.7%), Suffolk County
(6.6%), and Milwaukee (5.1%).

Departments in Large Cities, 1990-2000,
NCJ 175703 for more information on the
Nation's largest municipal police agencies.)

State-by-State comparisons

As of June 2000 Pennsylvania had the most 
full-time general purpose local police
departments (1,015).  Next were Texas
(737), Illinois (729), and Ohio (712).  
Other States with more than 400 local
police departments included New Jersey
(484), Michigan (450), Missouri (449), and
Wisconsin (417).  Excluding the District of
Columbia, Hawaii (4) had the least local
police departments, followed by Nevada
(28) and Delaware (33).  

Local police departments in the State of
New York had 74,737 full-time employees,
more than in any other State.  California was
second with 52,541.  Other States with more
than 25,000 full-time local police employees
were Texas (40,321), Illinois (34,382),
Florida (29,922), and New Jersey (25,114). 
Four States had fewer than 1,000 full-time
local police employees:  Vermont (735),
North Dakota (844), Wyoming (907), and
Montana (983).

After the District of Columbia (781), New
York ranked highest among the States in
terms of local police employees per 100,000
residents, with 394. Other States with 250 or
more local police employees per 100,000
residents included New Jersey (298), Illinois
(277), Hawaii (276), Massachusetts (263),
and Rhode Island (262).

New York (58,588) was the only State with
more than 50,000 full-time local police
officers.  California ranked second with
37,674 officers.  The other States with more
than 15,000 full-time local police officers
were Texas (30,525), Illinois (27,452), New
Jersey (21,046), Florida (21,035),
Pennsylvania (18,913), and Ohio (16,956).

In terms of full-time police officers per
100,000 residents, New York (309) was
second only to the District of Columbia
(631).  Other States with 200 or more local
police officers per 100,000 residents
included New Jersey (250), Illinois (221),
Massachusetts (218), Hawaii (215), and
Rhode Island (205). 

Sheriffs' offices

In June 2000 sheriffs' offices had about
36,000 more full-time employees than in
1996, an increase of 14.0%.  This included
an increase of about 12,000, or 7.7%, in
sworn personnel, and an increase of about
24,000, or 23.2%, in nonsworn employees.

In 2000 sheriffs' offices had 68,000, or
30.4%, more full-time employees, compared
to 1992.  Civilian employment rose by about
40,000, or 45.4% during this time, while the
number of sworn personnel increased by
approximately 28,000, or 23.2%. 

These increases, which are larger than
those for local police, were influenced to
some extent by the fact that about 4 in 5
sheriffs' departments are responsible for 
jail operations.  The Nation's jail inmate
population in June 2000 was 20% larger
than in June 1996, and 40% larger than in
June 1992.  (See the BJS Bulletin, Prison
and Jail Inmates at Midyear 2000, NCJ
185989).

Size of sheriffs' offices 

As of June 2000, of the 3,070 full-time
sheriffs' offices operating nationwide, 323,
or 10.5%, employed at least 100 full-time
sworn personnel. This included 12 agencies 
with 1,000 or more full-time sworn personnel.  
About a third (32.5%) of sheriffs' offices 
employed fewer than 10 full-time sworn 
personnel, and 25 agencies (0.8%) had just 
1 full-time officer. 

The 12 sheriffs' offices employing 1,000 or
more sworn personnel accounted for about
a sixth of full-time sheriffs' employees. 
About 62% of  all full-time sheriffs'
employees worked for an agency with 100
or more employees, including 64% of sworn
personnel. 

Functions of sheriffs' deputies

Nearly all sheriffs' offices are responsible
for responding to citizen calls for service. 
As of June 2000, 40% of sheriffs' deputies
were regularly assigned to patrol duty. 
Another 12% were assigned to investigative 
duties.  

In addition to handling calls for service,
about four-fifths of sheriffs' offices operate
1 or more jails.  Nearly all have court-related 
responsibilities such as the serving of process 
and court security.  In 2000, 22% of full-time 
sheriffs' deputies were assigned to jail-related 
duties, while 13% primarily performed court-
related duties.  In this latter category, about
two-thirds of officers were assigned to court 
security, and a third to process serving.  

The largest sheriffs' offices 

As of June 2000 the largest sheriff's office in
the Nation, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department, employed 8,438 full-time sworn
personnel.  Twenty-seven percent of that agency's 
full-time sworn personnel were assigned to patrol, 
and 8% to criminal investigations.  Nearly half 
were assigned to jail operations (27%) or court 
security (18%).

The second largest sheriff's office, with
5,309 full-time sworn personnel, was the
Cook County (IL) Sheriff's Office.  Most of
the officers in that agency were assigned to
duties related to jail or court operations.

Overall, 8 of the 25 largest sheriffs' offices, 
including 6 of the 10 largest, were in
California.  All of these agencies reported
that more than a fourth of their deputies had
regular patrol assignments.  All of them also
had a significant percentage of sworn
personnel assigned to jail-related duties. 

Another 5 of the 25 largest sheriffs' offices
were in Florida.  All of these agencies had at
least a third of their deputies assigned to
patrol operations; however, only the Palm
Beach County Sheriff's Office also operated
a jail. 

Of the three major categories of law
enforcement, jail operations, and court
operations, 13 of the 25 largest sheriffs'
departments had the largest number of
sworn personnel assigned to law enforcement, 
and 12 had the largest number assigned to 
jail duties.

State-by-State comparisons

residents nationwide.  The highest ratios
were in Wyoming (61), Florida (52), Louisiana 
(52), and Montana (51).

Primary State law 
enforcement agencies 

In June 2000, the 49 primary State law
enforcement agencies had 87,028 full-time
employees.  This was about 3,300, or 3.9%,
more than in 1996.  There were 56,348
full-time sworn personnel in 2000.  This was
about 1,800, or 3.2%, more than in 1996. 
Civilian employment rose by approximately
1,500, or 5.2%, during this period.  In 2000,
overall employment was up by about 8,500,
or 10.8%, compared to 1992.  This included
increases of about 5,100, or 19.9%, in
nonsworn employees, and of about 3,400,
or 6.4%, in sworn personnel.

In 2000, 69% of the full-time sworn personnel 
in State law enforcement agencies were patrol 
officers and 11% were investigators. Less than 
1% were assigned to court-related duties.

Seventeen agencies employed 1,000 or more full-
time sworn officers, and 34 employed at least 
500 such officers.  The largest, the California 
Highway Patrol, had 9,706 full-time employees 
including 6,678 full-time sworn personnel. The 
next largest were the Texas Department of Public 
Safety (7,025 and 3,119) and the Pennsylvania
State Police (5,694 and 4,152).  

The smallest agencies in terms of sworn
personnel were the North Dakota Highway
Patrol (126), the Wyoming Highway Patrol
(148), and the South Dakota Highway Patrol

Special jurisdiction agencies

In June 2000, nearly 1,400 State and local
law enforcement agencies with special
geographic jurisdictions or special
enforcement responsibilities were operating
in the United States.  These agencies had
43,413 full-time sworn personnel.  

About two-thirds (67%) of full-time sworn
personnel primarily handled patrol duties,
while 16% were criminal investigators. 
Approximately 1% were responsible for
court-related duties. 

More than 11,000 full-time police officers
serving public 4-year and 2-year colleges
and universities accounted for more than a
fourth of all sworn personnel serving special
jurisdictions.  Another 3,200 were police
officers for public school districts.  Agencies
