***********************************************     
On December 31, 2010, state and federal correctional
authorities had jurisdiction over 1,612,395 prisoners, a
decrease of 5,575 prisoners from yearend 2009 (figure 1). The
combined U.S. prison population decreased 0.3% in 2010, the
first decline since 1972. The 2010 imprisonment rate for the
nation was 500 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 U.S.
residents, which is 1 in 200 residents.

The statistics in this report are drawn from the Bureau of
Justice Statistics' (BJS) National Prisoner Statistics (NPS)
series, which annually collects data on prisoner counts and
characteristics, as well as admissions, releases, and
capacity, from the 50 states and the Federal Bureau of
Prisons. The 2010 NPS collection is the 85th in a series
begun in 1925.
********************************************
HIGHLIGHTS

* The overall U.S. prison population declined in 2010 for
the first time since 1972. State and federal prisoners
numbered 1,612,395 at yearend 2010, a decrease of 0.3% (5,575
prisoners) from yearend 2009.
                                         
* The federal prison population increased by 0.8% (1,653
prisoners), while the number of prisoners under state
authority declined by 0.5% (7,228 prisoners).

* Half of state departments of corrections (25) reported
decreases in their prison populations during 2010. California
(down 6,213) reported the largest decline in absolute
numbers, while Rhode Island (down 8.6%) reported the largest
percentage decrease.

* During 2010, prison releases (708,677) exceeded prison
admissions (703,798) for the first time since BJS began
collecting jurisdictional data in 1977.

* The stability in prison release rates and expected time
to be served indicates that the change in the state prison
population between 2009 and 2010 was the result of a decrease
in state prison admissions.

* The imprisonment rate was 500 inmates per 100,000 U.S.
residents in 2010, continuing the decline since imprisonment
rates peaked at 506 per 100,000 in 2007.

* In 2009, the most recent data available, 53% of state
prison inmates were serving time for violent offenses,
19% for property, 18% for drug, and 9% for public order
offenses.

* About half (51%) of federal inmates in 2010 were serving
time for drug offenses, 35% for public-order offenses
(largely weapons and immigration), and less than 10% each for
violent and property offenses.

* States held 2,295 inmates under age 18 in custody at
midyear 2010, down from 2,779 at midyear 2009. A reported
95,977 non citizens were held in state custody at midyear
2010, down from 97,133 at midyear 2009.
*************************************************

State correctional authorities had jurisdiction over
1,402,624 prisoners at yearend 2010, down slightly (0.8% or
10,881 prisoners) from yearend 2009 (table 1, figure 2). The
federal prison population reached 209,771 prisoners at
yearend 2010, up 0.8% (1,653 prisoners) from 2009. This is
the smallest percentage growth in the federal prison
population since 1980, when the federal population actually
decreased 7.6%. (Not shown in the table.)

Half of state departments of corrections (25)reported
decreases in their prison populations during 2010 (appendix
table 1). California (down 6,213)reported the largest decline
in absolute numbers, followed by New York (down 2,031) and
Michigan (down 1,365. The decline in these states (9,609) was
partly offset by increases in other states. Illinois (up
3,257) reported the largest increase in absolute numbers,
followed by Texas (up 2,400) and Arkansas (up 996).

Among state prisons, Rhode Island (down 8.6%) reported the
largest percentage decrease in the size of the prisoner
population during 2010, followed by Vermont (down 6.4%)
and Kentucky (down 5.1%).***Footnote 1 1In Rhode Island and
Vermont prisons and jails form one integrated system. Data
include jail and prison populations.***The 2010 decline in
these states contrasts with their average annual change
between 2000 and 2009, when Rhode Island had an average
annual prison population growth of 1.2%,Vermont averaged 3.0%
growth, and Kentucky averaged 4.2%.

During 2010, Iowa reported the largest percentage increase
(7.3%) in its state prison population, followed by Illinois
(up 7.2%), and Arkansas (up 6.5%. The population increases in
these states are substantially higher than their average
annual growth between 2000 and 2009, when Iowa had an average
annual population growth of 1.1%, the Illinois population
remained stable, and Arkansas averaged 2.7% growth (figure
3).

The imprisonment rate declined in 2010

The nation's imprisonment rate in 2010 was 500 sentenced
prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents, or 1 in 200 residents
(not shown in a figure). This was down from the 2009 rate of
504 prisoners per 100,000 or 1 in 198 residents. About 27%
of the decrease in the imprisonment rate was due to the
decline in the number of sentenced prisoners, and the
remaining 73% was due to the increase in the U.S. resident
population. Since 2007, the imprisonment rate has declined
each year, after reaching a peak of 506 per 100,000.

Between 2009 and 2010, the imprisonment rate for federal
prisoners remained at 61 per 100,000 U.S. residents, while
the state imprisonment rate declined from 444 to 439 per
100,000 (figures 4 and 5; appendix table 9). Compared to the
1990s when the state imprisonment rate increased 60%, from
272 inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents in 1990 to 434 per
100,000 in 1999, the state imprisonment rate has 
been relatively consistent during the 2000s, fluctuating
around 430.

Imprisonment rates decreased in 34 states during 2010, stayed
the same in the federal system, and increased in 16 states
(not shown in table or figure). Wisconsin (down 27 prisoners
per 100,000 state residents) reported the largest
imprisonment rate decline, followed by Kentucky (down 20),
and California (down 19). Arkansas (up 30 prisoners per
100,000 state residents) reported the largest increase in
imprisonment rate, followed by Illinois (up 24) and Iowa and
West Virginia (each up 17).

At yearend 2010, the male imprisonment rate for the nation
was 943 per 100,000 male residents (down from 952 at yearend
2009). The female imprisonment rate was unchanged at 67 per
100,000 female residents (appendix table 9).

Releases from prison exceeded admissions; however, both
declined during 2010

In 2010, both admissions to and releases from prison
decreased. Admissions were down 3.8% and releases were down
2.9% (figure 6). For the first time since BJS began
collecting jurisdictional data in 1977, releases from prison
(708,677) exceeded admissions to prison (703,798), resulting
in an overall decline in the prisoner population (table 2).

State prison admissions decreased 3.8% (down 25,746
admissions) during 2010. Among the 31 states with fewer
admissions in 2010, several large states led the trend.
California had the greatest decline in the number of
admissions (down 10,762 admissions or 8.3%), followed by
Florida (down 5,264 or 13.8%), Illinois (down 3,402
or 9.0%), and Ohio (down 2,265 or 8.4%) (appendix table 10a).
However, the overall decline in admissions was partly offset
by increases in several states, including Texas (up 2,476
admissions or 3.5%) and Louisiana (up 2,251 or 15.1%).

Releases from state prison decreased by 22,839 (down 3.4%),
led by some of the same states that experienced a
decline in admissions. Illinois released 6,979 fewer
prisoners (down 18.3%), California 6,951 fewer (down 5.4%),
and Florida 4,518 fewer (down 12.2%). Louisiana had the
largest increase in the number of prisoners released during
the year (up 2,338 or 15.7%), followed by Kentucky (up 1,824
or 12.9%). Federal prison admissions decreased 3.6% in 2010,
while releases increased 3.5%. There were 1,767 more
sentenced federal prisoners released in 2010 than in 2009.

Decline in state prison admissions was led by a decrease in
parole violators admitted in California

Most offenders enter prison in one of two ways. About
two-thirds are admitted as new court commitments.
New court commitments include admissions into prison of
offenders convicted and sentenced by a court, usually to a
term of more than 1 year, including probation violators
and persons with a split sentence to incarceration followed
by court-ordered probation or parole. About a third of
new court commitments were admitted because they violated a
condition of supervised release. Parole violators include all
conditional release violators returned to prison for either
violation of conditions of release or for new crimes. Both
types of admissions declined in 2010.

New court commitments to state prison totaled 408,845 in
2010, a 3.5% decrease (14,628 fewer admissions) from 2009.
The decrease in new court commitments accounted for more than
half of the total decline in the number of state prison
admissions in 2010 (table 3). Florida (down 5,165 from 2009),
Illinois (down 4,593), and California (down 3,405) accounted
for nearly 90% of the decrease in new court commitments
among state prison systems (not shown).

In addition to new court commitments, 227,311 parole
violators returned to state prison. This number represents a
decrease of 10,408 (4.4%) from 2009 and accounts for about
40% of the total decline in the number of state prison
admissions during 2010 (table 3). California admitted 7,357
fewer parole violators in 2010, accounting for about
three-quarters (71%) of the total decrease in such admissions
among states (not shown.

The decrease in releases from state prisons was divided
between conditional and unconditional releases Most offenders
are released in one of two ways. About three-quarters are
released conditionally (i.e., released to parole or another
form of supervised release). About a quarter are released
unconditionally (e.g. expiration of sentence or commutation).
The 3.4% overall decrease in state prisoner releases during
2010 (down 22,839 prisoners), was due partly to fewer
conditional releases (down 10,738 or 2.1%) and partly to
fewer unconditional releases (down 10,727 or 6.6%). (See
type of releases in Definition of Terms.) greater decrease in
admissions resulted in a decline in the overall prison
population (table 4). Illinois (down 7,922 conditional
releases) and California (down 6,900) had the largest
declines in conditional releases, partially offset by
increases in Virginia (up 8,278). The decrease in
unconditional releases during 2010 is largely attributable to
Virginia (down 8,301 due in part to a change in
reporting methods) and Florida (down 2,818) (not shown).

Decline in admissions accounted for decrease in state prison
population, as time served by state prisoners remained
relatively unchanged

The mean expected time to be served in state prisons from
arrival to release was constant between 2009 and 2010.
The stability in expected time to serve in prison cannot
account for the decline in the number of prisoners under
state correctional authorities (table 5).

Nationwide state prisoners could expect to serve about 2
years from arrival to release in 2010, as mean expected time
to be served has been relatively constant from 2000 through
2010. This measure of time served does not account for
differences in expected time served between the two types of
admissions (new court commitments versus parole violator).
Given the stability in release rates and expected time to be
served, the change in the state prison population between
2009 and 2010 must be the result of the decrease in the
number admitted into state prisons. Within admission types,
the decline in new court commitments accounted for more than
half of the overall decline in admissions, and fewer
admissions from the courts indicates either a decrease in the
probability of a prison sentence, given conviction, or a
decrease in the number of convictions. Data on these two
measures are not yet available for 2010.

Other selected findings--

* The sentenced male prison population decreased by 2,716, or
0.2% (appendix table 6); the sentenced female population
decreased by 727, or 0.7% (appendix table 8).

* Males had an imprisonment rate of 943 per 100,000 male U.
S. residents, 14 times higher than the rate for females (67
per 100,000 female U.S. residents) (appendix table 9).

* At yearend 2010, black non-Hispanic males had an
imprisonment rate (3,074 per 100,000 U.S. black male
residents) that was nearly 7 times
higher than white non-Hispanic males (459 per 100,000)
(appendix table 14).

* Black non-Hispanic females (133 per 100,000 U.S. black
female residents) had an imprisonment rate nearly 3
times that of white non-Hispanic females (47 per 100,000)
(appendix table 14).

* An estimated 7.3% of black males ages 30-34 were in state
or federal prison (appendix table 15).

* At yearend 2009 (the most recent data available), males
sentenced to more than 1 year incarcerated in state prison
for violent offenses (54%), followed by property (18%), and
drug offenses (17%) (appendix table 17b).

* More than a third (36%) of females sentenced to more than 1
year were incarcerated for violent offenses. Property
offenses (30%) and drug offenses (26%) were the next most
prevalent offenses (appendix table 17b).

table 25 for state-level definitions of noncitizen).   

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

Begun in 1926 under a mandate from
Congress, the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program
collects annual statistics on prisoners at yearend. The
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) sponsors the survey,
and the U.S. Census Bureau serves as the data collection
agent. BJS depends entirely on the voluntary participation of
state departments of corrections and the Federal Bureau of
Prisons for NPS data.

The NPS distinguishes between prisoners in custody and
prisoners under jurisdiction. To have custody of a
prisoner, a state or federal prison must hold that inmate in
one of its facilities. Jurisdiction over a prisoner means
state or federal officials have legal authority over that
prisoner regardless of where the prisoner is incarcerated or
supervised.
Some states are unable to provide counts that distinguish
between custody and jurisdiction. (See Jurisdiction Notes to
determine which states did not distinguish between custody
and jurisdiction counts.)

The NPS jurisdiction counts include persons held in prisons,
penitentiaries, correctional facilities, halfway houses,
boot camps, farms, training or treatment centers, and
hospitals. Counts also include prisoners who are--

* temporarily absent (less than 30 days), out to court, or on
work release;

* housed in privately operated facilities, local jails, other
state or federal facilities; and/or serving concurrent
sentences for more than one correctional authority.    

The NPS custody counts include all inmates held within a
state's facilities, including inmates housed for other
states. The custody counts exclude inmates held in local
jails and in other jurisdictions. With a few exceptions,
the final custody counts reported by BJS include inmates held
in privately operated facilities.

The NPS has historically included counts of inmates in the
combined jail prison systems of Alaska, Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The District of
Columbia (D.C.) has not operated a prison system since
yearend 2001. Felons sentenced under the D.C. criminal
code are housed in federal facilities. Jail inmates in D.C.
are included in the Annual Survey of Jails. Some previously
published prisoner counts and the percentage change in
population include D.C. jail inmates for 2001, the last year
of collection.

Admissions include new court commitments, parole violator
returns, and other conditional release violator returns;
transfers from other jurisdictions; returns of prisoners
absent without leave (AWOL), with or without a new sentence;
escape returns, with or without a new sentence; returns from
appeal or bond, and other admissions. For reporting purposes,
BJS admission counts exclude transfers from other
jurisdictions, AWOL returns, and escape returns.

Releases include unconditional releases (i.e., expirations of
sentence, commutations, and other conditional releases),
conditional releases (i.e., probations, supervised mandatory
releases, discretionary paroles, and other conditional
releases), deaths, AWOLs, escapes from confinement, transfers
to other jurisdictions, releases to appeal or bond, and other
releases. For reporting purposes, BJS release counts exclude
AWOLs, escapes, and transfers to other jurisdictions.

BJS allows respondents to update data they previously
submitted. This report includes the most recently reported
data for 2009 and 2010. Additional information about the NPS,
including the data collection instrument, is available on the
BJS website at www.bjs.gov.

Estimating imprisonment rates by age, sex, and race/Hispanic
origin

Estimates of the total number of sentenced prisoners on
December 31, 2010, by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin
were generated by creating separate totals for federal and
state prisons and then combining them.

Federal prisoner data used to calculate age, race, and
offense distributions are obtained from the BJS Federal
Justice Statistics Program (FJSP). The FJSP obtains prisoner
data from the Federal Bureau of Prisons. These data include
individual-level records of prisoners in federal facilities
as of September 30. Specifically, the FJSP provides counts of
sentenced federal inmates by age, sex, race, Hispanic origin,
and offense.

Federal prisoner estimates were generated by calculating
ratios of FJSP race counts within each sex to the FJSP
sex count (e.g., FJSP white male total divided by FJSP male
total). This ratio was then multiplied by the NPS counts
of sentenced federal prisoners within the appropriate sex
(e.g., NPS male total), resulting in FJSP-adjusted NPS
count for each sex-race combination (e.g., NPS white males,
adjusted to match the ratio of whites in the male
FJSP population).

Each sex-race count was then multiplied by the ratio of FJSP
age category count within the sex-race combination to the
FJSP total count within the sex-race combination (e.g., FJSP
18-19 year old white males divided by FJSP white males). The
resulting product yielded the FJSP-adjusted NPS counts for
each sex-race combination by age group (e.g., 18-19 year-old
white male prisoners in the federal prison system).

Estimated state prisoner counts were generated by calculating
the ratio of the various NPS jurisdiction race totals
within each sex to the NPS jurisdiction sex total (e.g., NPS
black female total jurisdiction divided by NPS female
total jurisdiction) and multiplying the result by the NPS
sentenced prisoner count for the sex (e.g., NPS sentenced
female total). Once this was completed for each sex-race
combination, a ratio adjustment was applied to the resulting
totals so they summed to the proper sentenced jurisdictional
total (e.g., estimated sentenced prisoner counts for white
females, black females, and other females summed to the NPS
sentenced female prisoner count). A similar ratio adjustment
was applied to the NPS jurisdiction counts to create
sentenced prisoner counts by race. Once these totals were
created, a method similar to the one used with federal
prisoners was employed, adjusting National Corrections
Reporting Program (NCRP) data by age, sex, race, and
Hispanic origin to match the estimated NPS sentenced prisoner
counts for each sex-race combination.***Footnote 3The NCRP
data used in 2010 are improved from prior years in their
completeness and timeliness. Use caution when comparing
totals and imprisonment rates by age, sex, and race/Hispanic
origin over time***.

The resulting totals were finally ratio adjusted so the
totals within each sex-race category matched the NPS
sentenced prisoner counts, adjusted for the difference
between administrative race data and the self-reported race
data from the 2008-2009 National Inmate Survey. ***Footnote 4
Prior year administrative data were adjusted to the 2004
Survey of Inmates in State and Local Correctional
Facilities.*** As described above, the resulting totals were
combined with the federal prisoner counts to create estimates
of the total number of sentenced prisoners on December 31,
2010, by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin.

Age-specific imprisonment rates for each age-sex-race group
were calculated by dividing the estimated number of
sentenced prisoners within each age group by the estimated
number of U.S. residents in each age group on January
1, 2011. The result was multiplied by 100,000 and rounded to
the nearest whole number. Totals by sex include all
prisoners and U.S. residents regardless of race or Hispanic
origin. Detailed race and Hispanic origin imprisonment rates
exclude persons identifying as two or more races. 

Calculating release rates and mean time served

Mean expected time to be served was estimated using two
methods that take into account growth in the prison
population (table 5). The measure of expected time to be
served is an estimate of mean time to be served by
persons entering prison. This measure differs from other
estimates that are based on the actual time served by
persons released from prison. Research has shown that
estimates of time served for exiting cohorts are biased
estimates of time served for persons entering prison,
especially when prison population size is changing or the
number of admissions is changing. (For example, see
Patterson, E.J. and S.H. Preston (2008). "Estimating Mean
Length of Stay in Prisons: Methods and Applications," Journal
of Quantitative Criminology, 24, 33-49.)

The adjustment for growth in the prison population reduces
bias in estimates of time served based only on exits. The
two adjusted measures of expected time served were a
growth-adjusted release rate measure and a growth-adjusted
entry rate measure. The growth-adjusted exit rate measure
applies the mean rate of growth in the prison population to
the reciprocal of the release rate, or--

Mean expected time served=(Pt Pt-1)/r/Rt

Where:

t=year

P=the number of sentenced prisoners

r=mean growth rate, calculated as

ln(Pt/Pt-1)

R=number of releases

The entry rate estimate of mean time to be served, corrected
for growth, was estimated as follows.

1/[(Pt/At)*(1-rAp)]

Where t, P, and r are as above, and At= the number of
sentenced admissions, and Ap equals the mean duration of the
prison population, that is mean time served from admission
until yearend. Estimates of mean duration of the prison
population came from NCRP data.

Prison capacities

State and federal correctional authorities provide three
measures of their facilities' capacity: design capacity,
operational capacity, and rated capacity. Estimates of the
prison populations as a percentage of capacity are based on a
state or federal custody population. In general, state
capacity and custody counts exclude inmates held in private
facilities, although six states include prisoners held in
private facilities as part of the capacity of their prison
systems: Georgia, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma,
and New Mexico. For these states, prison population as a
percent of capacity includes private facilities.

**********************************************
NPS jurisdiction notes

Alabama--Operational capacity represents physical capacity to
hold inmates, but is not based on staffing, programs, and
services.

Alaska--Prisons and jails form one integrated system. Data
include jail and prison populations unless otherwise
specified. Jurisdiction totals include individuals in
electronic and special monitoring programs. Noncitizen data
include only offenders known to be noncitizens and do not
include offenders of unknown citizenship.

The Alaska Department of Corrections was unable to provide
admissions and releases by type. These counts were imputed
using a ratio adjustment based on the 2009 admission and
release data reported by the state. Capacity counts were not
provided in 2010; the 2009 capacity counts were imputed by
BJS at the the state's request.

Arizona--Population counts are based on custody data and
inmates in contracted beds. The Arizona Department of
Corrections added about 4,000 state beds rated as operational
capacity and some inmates previously housed out of state or
in private facilties were transferred to state beds. This
transfer is reflected in the change between 2009 and 2010 in
the private and noncitizen counts.

California--Jurisdiction counts include felons who are
temporarily absent (i.e., housed in local jails, out to
court, or in hospitals) and include offenders in the
California Civil Addict Program (CAP) who are temporarily
absent and typically returned to prison within 30 days. The
CAP is a drug abuse treatment program offering treatment both
onsite and offsite.

Colorado--Population counts for prisoners with a sentence of
more than 1 year include an undetermined number of prisoners
with sentences of 1 year or less. Counts include 259 male and
11 female inmates in the Youthful Offender System, which was
established primarily for violent juvenile offenders.
Mandatory releases have increased due to a legislative
revision that went into effect July 2009. Operational and
design capacity do not include privately run facilities.
Noncitizen is defined as foreign born.

Connecticut--Prisons and jails form one integrated system.
Data include jail and prison populations unless otherwise
specified. Legislation in July 1995 abolished the capacity
law. The capacity of a facility is a fluid number based upon
the needs of the department. The needs are dictated by
security issues, populations, court decrees, legal mandates,
staffing, and physical plant areas or facilities that are
serving other purposes or have been decommissioned. The
actual capacity of a facility is subject to change.

Delaware--Prisons and jails form one integrated system. Data
include jail and prison populations unless otherwise
specified. Capacity counts include halfway houses under the
Department of Corrections.

Federal Bureau of Prisons--Counts include inmates housed in
secure facilities through private contracts and subcontracts.
They also included 8,629 inmates held in nonsecure privately
operated community corrections centers and 2,548 offenders on
home confinement. Expirations of sentence include good
conduct releases that usually have a separate and distinct
term of supervision. The Federal Bureau of Prisons does not
house inmates under age 18 in federal facilities; 142 such
inmates were housed in contract facilities.

Florida--Noncitizen counts includes both confirmed and
suspected alien inmates.

Georgia Population counts exclude an undetermined number of
inmates housed in local jails, awaiting transfer to prison.
Counts may not compare to previous years due to a data system
conversion.

The Georgia Department of Corrections (GDC) was unable to
provide jurisdiction counts of admissions by type or releases
by type. Jurisdiction counts by race, type of admission, and
