The total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of
Federal or State adult correctional authorities was
1,440,655 at yearend 2002. During the year the States 
added 30,088 prisoners, and the Federal prison system 
added 6,535 prisoners. Overall, the Nation=s prison 
population grew 2.6%, which was less than the average 
annual growth of 3.6% since yearend 1995.  

The rate of incarceration in prison at yearend 2002
was 476 sentenced inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents -- 
up from 411 in 1995. About 1 in every 110 men and 1 in 
every 1,656 women were sentenced prisoners under the 
jurisdiction of State or Federal authorities. Overall, 
the United States incarcerated 2,166,260 persons at 
yearend 2002.  This total represents persons held in -- 
-- Federal and State prisons (1,361,258, which
excludes State and Federal prisoners in local jails)
-- territorial prisons (16,206)
-- local jails (665,475)
-- facilities operated by or exclusively for the
Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement,
formerly the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service (8,748)
-- military facilities (2,377) 
-- jails in Indian country (1,912 as of midyear 2001)
-- juvenile facilities (110,284 as of October 2000).

1 in every 143 U.S. residents in prison or jail at
yearend 2002  

On December 31, 2002, 1,361,258 inmates were in the 
custody of State and Federal prison authorities, and 
665,475 were in the custody of local jail authorities. 
Since yearend 2001 the total incarcerated population 
has increased 72,084, or 3.7% -- just over the average 
annual increase  since 1995 (3.6%). Including inmates 
in public and privately operated facilities, the number 
of inmates in State prisons increased 2.5% during 2002; 
the number in Federal prisons, 5.8%; and in local jails, 
5.4%. 

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail was 701
inmates per 100,000 residents in 2002, up from 601
in 1995.  At yearend 2002, 1 in every 143 U.S. residents 
were incarcerated in State or Federal prison or a local 
jail.

U.S. prison population rose 2.6% during 2002 --
the largest annual growth rate since 1999

In 2002 the growth in the number of inmates under State 
or Federal jurisdiction (2.6%) was more than twice the  
percentage increase recorded during 2001 (1.1%). The 
population under the jurisdiction of State and Federal 
authorities increased by 36,623 inmates during 2002, 
higher than the increase in 2001 (up 15,521). 

The prison population has grown an average of 45,000 
inmates per year (3.6%) since yearend 1995. However, 
the overall growth of the Nation's prison population 
has dropped from  6.7% in 1995 to 2.6% in 2002, with 
a low of 1.1% growth in 2001.  

Since January 1, 1995, 6-month growth rates for State 
prisoners have declined.  Growth rates in the first 
half of each year have been substantially larger than 
rates in the second half, except for 2002 when the 
rate was 1.2% for both 6-month periods. At the same 
time, Federal growth rates rose, reaching a peak of 
6.0% in the first 6 months of 1999. Since then, growth 
in the first half of each year slowed (to 5.1% in 2001 
and 3.0% in 2002). 

17 States reported increases of at least 
5% during 2002; 9 States had decreases 

Between January 1 and December 31, Maine experienced the 
largest increase (up 11.5%), followed by Rhode Island 
(8.6%), and Connecticut, Colorado, and Minnesota (all up 
7.9%). Nine States experienced a decline in prison 
populations. Alaska had the largest decline (down 3.8%), 
followed by Illinois (down 3.7%), Delaware (down 3.2%), 
and Massachusetts (down 2.4%).

In absolute numbers of inmates, 5 jurisdictions grew
by at least 2,000 inmates during 2002. The Federal
system (up 6,535), experienced the largest growth,
followed by California (up 2,873), Florida (up 2,806),
Pennsylvania (up 2,106), and Virginia (up 2,067).  

Overall, inmates under jurisdiction in the West grew
by 3.0%, followed by those in the South (2.5%) and in
the Northeast and Midwest (both 1.9%). In the same
period, the Federal system grew 4.2%. 

In the last 6 months of 2002, the State prison
population rose by over 15,000 inmates 

Between July 1 and December 31, 2002, the number
of inmates under State jurisdiction increased 1.2%
(from 1,261,414 inmates to 1,277,127, compared to a
-0.5% decrease in the last 6 months of 2001. The
Federal population grew at a slower rate, up 1.1%
since midyear 2002. In the last 6 months of 2002, the
Federal population rose 1,847, compared to an
increase of 4,688 inmates in the first 6 months.

Since 1995 the sentenced inmate population in State
prisons has grown 24%. During this period 12 States
increased their populations at least 50%, led by North
Dakota (up 88%), Idaho (up 86%), and Oregon (up
85%).  Between 1995 and 2002 the Federal system
reported an additional 59,377 inmates sentenced to
more than a year, an increase of 71%. 

The number of female prisoners increased 4.9%
-- double that of men, 2.4% -- during 2002

During 2002 the number of women under the jurisdiction 
of State or Federal prison authorities increased 4.9%, 
compared to a 0.2% drop in 2001. The number of men in  
prison rose 2.4%, up from 1.2% the previous year.  At 
yearend 2002 there were 97,491 women and 1,343,164 men 
in State or Federal prisons.

From 1995 to 2002 the average annual rate of growth
of the female inmate population was 5.2%, higher
than the average 3.5% increase in the male inmate
population. Since 1995 the total number of male
prisoners has grown 27%; the number of female
prisoners 42%. By yearend 2002 women accounted
for 6.8% of all prisoners, up from 6.1% in 1995. 

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident population, 
men were about 15 times more likely than women to be in 
a State or Federal prison.  At yearend 2002 there were 
60 sentenced female inmates per 100,000 women, compared 
to 906 sentenced male inmates per 100,000 men.

Over a third of female prisoners held in the 3
largest jurisdictions

Texas (13,051), the Federal system (11,234), and
California (10,050) held more than a third of all
female inmates. Oklahoma (with 131 sentenced female 
inmates per 100,000 female residents), Mississippi 
(126), Louisiana (96), and Texas (96) had the highest 
female incarceration rates. States with the lowest 
female incarceration rates were concentrated in the 
Northeast -- Rhode Island and Massachusetts (each 
with 11 sentenced female prisoners per 100,000 female 
residents) and Maine (12). 

Since 1995 the number of female prisoners under Federal 
jurisdiction has increased 52%, from 7,398 to 11,234 
while the number under State jurisdiction has increased 
41%, from 61,070 to 86,257. 

At yearend 2002, 1 in every 1,656 women and 1 in every 
110 men were incarcerated in a State or Federal prison. 

Privately operated prisons held 6.5% of State 
and Federal inmates in 2002

At yearend 2002, 31 States and the Federal system
reported a total of 93,771 prisoners held in privately
operated facilities. Private facilities held 5.8% of all
State prisoners and 12.4% of Federal prisoners. Among 
States, Texas (with 16,773 State inmates housed in 
private facilities) and Oklahoma (with 6,470) reported 
the largest number in 2002. Five States -- New Mexico 
(43%), Alaska (31%), Wyoming (30%), Montana (29%), and 
Oklahoma (28%) --  had at least 25% of their prison 
population housed in private facilities. 

Except for Wisconsin (with 16% of its State inmates
in private facilities) and New Jersey (9%), the use of
private facilities was concentrated among Southern
and Western States. Overall, 8.0% of State inmates
in the South and 6.2% of inmates in the West were in
privately operated facilities at the end of 2002,
compared to 1.8% in the Northeast and 2.7% in the
Midwest. 

In 2002 local jails held about 5% of State and
Federal prisoners 

At the end of 2002, 32 States and the Federal system
reported a total of 71,256 State and Federal prisoners 
held in local jails or other facilities operated by 
county or local authorities.  These inmates held in
local jails represented 4.9% of all prisoners in 2002.  

Louisiana had the largest percentage of its State
inmate population housed in local jails (45%). Due to
a partnership with the Louisiana Sheriff’s Association
and local authorities, 16,048 State inmates in
Louisiana were housed in local jails at yearend 2002.
Five other States -- led by Tennessee (27%) and
Kentucky (23%) -- had at least a fifth of their
population housed in local jails.

The region which utilized local jails to hold prisoners
most often was the South (with 10.2% of prisoners in
local jails), followed by the West (1.8%), the Northeast 
(1.3%), and the Midwest (0.7%). 

25 States and Federal system operating at or
above highest capacity

To estimate the capacity of their prisons, jurisdictions
were asked to supply three measures for capacity at
yearend 2002: rated, operational, and design capacities. 
These measures were defined as follows:

Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned 
by a rating official to institutions within the
jurisdiction.

Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can 
be accommodated, based on a facility's staff, existing 
programs, and services.

Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners 
or architects intended for the facility. 

Twenty-two jurisdictions provided only 1 measure or
the same figure for each measure. For the 28
jurisdictions with more than 1 reported type of
capacity, estimates of population as a percent of
capacity are based on the highest and lowest figures
provided.

At yearend 2002, 24 States reported that they were
operating below 100% of their highest capacity, and
25 States and the Federal prison system reported
operating at 100% or more of their highest capacity.
Idaho, which was operating at 71% of its highest
capacity, reported the lowest percent of capacity
occupied. Delaware, 116% over lowest reported
capacity, and Alabama, 101% over, had the highest
percent of capacity occupied. 

At yearend 2002 the Federal prison system was
operating at 33% over capacity. Overall, State
prisons were operating at between 1% over their
highest capacity and 17% above their lowest
capacity.

Immigration and Customs detainees rose during
2002 

The U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(BICE), formerly the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service (INS), reported 21,065 detainees on December 31, 
2002, up from 19,137 at yearend 2001. Over half of these 
detainees (11,317) were held in Federal and State prisons
and local jails, and about a third were held in BICE-
operated facilities (5,087) and private facilities
under exclusive contract to the BICE (1,936).

Among the 21,065 BICE detainees for immigration
violations at yearend 2002, 10,763 had been
convicted of criminal offenses, and 1,725 had
pending criminal cases (not shown in table).
Detainees convicted of violent offenses (31.6%)
and drug offenses (31.4%) constituted the largest
groups under BICE jurisdiction, followed by property
offenses (14.7%), and public-order offenses (12.6%). 

Prisoners held by military authorities dropped
2.4% 

There were 2,377 prisoners under military jurisdiction
at yearend 2002. Fifty-seven percent of the prisoners
held by the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps and
Coast Guard had sentences of 1 year or more. At
yearend 2002 the Army’s Disciplinary Barracks, Fort
Leavenworth, Kansas, and five other local or regional
Army facilities held the largest share of all inmates
under military jurisdiction (41%). The 11 Navy
facilities held nearly 34% of all inmates; the 6 Marine
Corps facilities held 20% of all inmates; and the 36
Air Force facilities held 5% of all inmates.

The total operational capacity of the 59 military
confinement facilities was 3,249 (not shown in a
table). At yearend 2002 these facilities were
operating at 73% of their operational capacity. About
86% of prisoners held by the Army, Air Force, Navy,
and Marine Corps were convicted inmates; 14% were
unconvicted persons whose cases had not been
tried. 

At yearend 2002, 16,206 inmates held in U.S.
Territories, up 2.1%

The U.S. Territories and Commonwealths  - American Samoa, 
Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and Virgin 
Islands -- reported 16,206 inmates in custody of their 
prison systems at yearend 2002, an increase of 2.1% since 
2001.  

Three-quarters of the total territorial prison population
(or 12,296) had a sentence of more than 1 year. Since 
1995 the number of sentenced prisoners held in U.S. 
Territories has grown 31%, compared to the 24% increase 
in the number of sentenced State prisoners.

Relative to the resident populations in the Territories,
the rate of incarceration was 286 prisoners per 100,000 
residents -- less than two-thirds of the combined rate 
of the 50 States. Of the 5 Territories, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands had the highest prison incarceration rate (360 
inmates per 100,000 residents), followed by Puerto Rico 
(with 294). Puerto Rico, the largest of the Territories, 
had the most sentenced prisoners (11,371 at yearend 2002), 
up from 11,020 in 2001.  

More black males than white males among State
and Federal inmates at yearend 2002

At yearend 2002, black males (586,700) outnumbered white 
males (436,800) and Hispanic males (235,000) among inmates 
with sentences of more than 1 year. Black inmates 
represented an estimated 45% of all inmates with sentences 
of more than 1 year, while white inmates accounted for 34%
and Hispanic inmates, 18%.

Although the total number of sentenced inmates rose
sharply (up 27% between 1995 and 2002), there were only 
small changes in the racial and Hispanic composition of 
the inmate population.

An estimated 10% of black males, age 25-29, in
prison in 2002

When incarceration rates are estimated separately by
age group, black males in their twenties and thirties
are found to have high rates relative to other groups. 
Expressed in percentages, 10.4% of black males age
25 to 29 were in prison on December 31, 2002, compared 
to 2.4% of Hispanic males and about 1.2% of white males 
in the same age group. Although incarceration rates drop 
with age, the percentage of black males age 45 to 54 in 
prison in 2002 was nearly 2.3% -- only slightly lower 
than the highest rate (2.4%) among Hispanic males (age 
30 to 34)and more than twice the highest rate (1.3%) 
among white males (age 30 to 34). 

Female incarceration rates, though substantially
lower than male incarceration rates at every age,
reveal similar racial and ethnic disparities. Black
females (with an incarceration rate of 191 per
100,000) were more than twice as likely as Hispanic
females (80 per 100,000) and 5 times more likely
than white females (35 per 100,000) to be in prison
on December 31, 2002. These differences among white, 
black, and Hispanic females were consistent across 
all age groups.
 
Growth linked to increasing number of inmates 
in State prison for violent offenses

Between 1995 and 2001 the distribution of the four
major offense categories -- violent, property, drug,
and public-order offenses --hanged slightly among
State prisoners. 

The percentage of State prisoners serving time for
property and drug offenses dropped while the
percentage held for violent and public-order offenses
rose.

In absolute numbers, an estimated 596,100 inmates in
State prison at yearend 2001 were held for violent
offenses, 159,200 for murder, 155,300 for robbery,
118,800 for assault, and 118,500 for rape or other
sexual assaults.  In addition, 233,000 inmates were held
for property offenses, 246,100 for drug offenses, and
129,900 for public-order offenses. Overall, the largest
growth in State inmates between 1995 and 2001 was
among violent offenders. From 1995 to 2001 the number 
of violent offenders grew 130,800, while the number of 
drug offenders grew 30,600. As a percentage of the 
total growth, violent offenders accounted for 63% of 
the growth; drug offenders 15%; property offenders 2%; 
and public-order offenders 20%. 

Sources of growth differ among men and women
and among white, black, and Hispanic inmates

The increasing number of violent offenders accounted for 
64% of the total growth among male inmates and 49% among 
female inmates. Public-order offenders accounted for 
another 21% of the total growth among male inmates and 
16% of the growth among female inmates.

The growth attributed to drug offenders has decreased 
from that of previous years (Prisoners in 2001, <www.ojp.
usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/p01.htm>).  From 1995 to 2001 drug 
offenders accounted for 13% of total growth among female 
inmates and 15% of growth among male inmates.  

Property offenders accounted for 22% of female population 
growth from 1995 to 2001, but dropped by an estimated 200 
offenders among males.  The sources of population growth 
also differed among white, black, and Hispanic prisoners. 
Overall, violent offenders accounted for the largest source 
of growth for all groups -- among white State inmates 
(59%), black inmates (57%), and Hispanic inmates (82%).
The increasing number of drug offenses accounted for 23% 
of the total growth among black inmates and 18% of the 
growth among white inmates.  

Changing Federal prison population related to
drug and immigration offenses

Prisoners sentenced for drug offenses constituted the
largest group of Federal inmates (55%) in 2001, down 
from 60% in 1995.  On September 30, 2001, the date of 
the latest available data in the Federal Justice 
Statistics Program, Federal prisons held 78,501 
sentenced drug offenders, compared to 52,782 in 1995.  

Between 1995 and 2001, the number of Federal inmates 
held for public-order offenses increased 133%, most of 
which was accounted for by the increase in immigration 
offenses (up 339%). The number of immigration offenders 
rose from 3,420 in 1995 to 15,012 in 2001. By September 
30, 2001, immigration violators represented over 10% of
Federal inmates.

In addition Federal inmates held for a weapons offense 
increased 68.4% from 1995 to 2001, from 7,446 to 12,539. 
Weapons offenders accounted for over 9% of the overall 
growth in this period. 
   
Violent offenders under Federal jurisdiction increased
41% from 1995 to 2001, and accounted for almost 9% of 
the total growth during the period.  Homicide offenders 
increased 121%, from 1,068 in 1995 to 2,364 in 2001. 

While the number of offenders in each major offense
category increased, the number incarcerated for a
drug offense accounted for the largest percentage of
the total growth (48%), followed by public-order
offenders (38%).   

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), with the U.S.
Census Bureau as its collection agent, obtains yearend 
and midyear counts of prisoners from departments of 
correction in each of the 50 States and the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons. 

In an effort to collect comparable data from all
jurisdictions, National Prisoner Statistics (NPS)
distinguishes prisoners in custody from those under
jurisdic-tion. To have custody of a prisoner, a State
must hold that person in one of its facilities. To have
jurisdiction means that a State has legal authority
over the prisoner. Prisoners under a State=s
jurisdiction may be in the custody of a local jail,
another State=s prison, or other correctional facility.
Some States are unable to provide both custody and
jurisdiction counts. (See National  Prisoner Statistics
jurisdiction notes, 12/31/02, <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/
bjs/abstract/p02.htm>.)

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in
locally administered confinement facilities who are
under the jurisdiction of local authorities. NPS counts
include all inmates in State-operated facilities in
Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, 
and Vermont, which have combined jail-prison systems. 
At yearend 2001, the Federal Bureau of Prisons assumed 
responsibility for housing all sentenced felons in the 
District of Columbia. As a result, inmates in the District 
of Columbia, previously included in the NPS counts as 
prisoners in combined prison-jail systems, were 
reclassified as jail inmates and included in BJS jail 
statistics. (See Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 2002,
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/pjim02.htm>.) 

Military corrections statistics

BJS obtains yearend counts of prisoners in the
custody of U.S. military authorities from the
Department of Defense Corrections Council. The
council, comprised of representatives from each
branch of military service, adopted in 1994 a
standardized report (DD Form 2720) with a common
set of items and definitions. This report provides
information on persons held in U.S. military
confinement facilities inside and outside the
continental United States, by branch of service, sex,
race, Hispanic origin, conviction status, sentence
length, and offense.  It also includes data on the
number of facilities, and their design and rated
capacities.

Other inmate counts

BJS obtains yearend counts of persons detained by
the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(BICE), an agency within the Department of
Homeland Security. BICE, formerly the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, holds
persons for immigration violations in Federal, State,
and locally operated prisons and jails, as well as in
private facilities under exclusive contract and in
BICE-operated facilities. 

In 1995 BJS began collecting yearend  counts of
prisoners from the departments of correction in the
three U.S. Territories (American Samoa, Guam, and
U.S. Virgin Islands) and two U.S. Commonwealths
(Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico). These
counts include all sentenced and unsentenced
inmates for whom the Territory or Commonwealth
government had legal authority (inmates under
jurisdiction) and all inmates who were physically
located in prison or jail facilities (inmates in custody).
