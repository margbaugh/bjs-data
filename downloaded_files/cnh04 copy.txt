Highlights

By Patsy Klaus
BJS Statistician

The percentage of U.S. households experiencing 
one or more crimes dropped from 25% in 1994 to 
14% in 2004

* Both violent and property crimes declined 
between 1994 and 2004.

* Households with at least one member who
experienced a violent crime declined from
7% in 1994 to 3% in 2004.

* Households experiencing property crimes
declined from 21% in 1994 to 12% in 2004.

* In 2004 about 16 million households
experienced one or more property crimes 
or had a member age 12 or older who
experienced one or more violent crimes.

* About 1 in every 27 households in 2004
were either burglarized or had a member
age 12 or older who was a victim of a
violent crime committed by a stranger. The
portion of households affected by these
crimes has fallen since 1994, but did not
change between 2003 and 2004.

* In 2004 about 1 in 250 households included 
a member victimized by a intimate partner, 
such as a spouse, ex-spouse, boyfriend, or 
girlfriend.

* About 5% of households had at least one
incident of vandalism in 2004.  Over 5.6
million households were vandalized during
this period.
-------------------------------------------

In 2004, 14% of households in the United
States, accounting for 16 million
households, experienced 1 or more violent
or property victimizations as measured by
the National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS).  These crimes include rape/sexual
assault, robbery, aggravated and simple
assault, purse snatching or pocket
picking, household burglary, motor vehicle
theft, and property theft.

In 2004, 3% of households had a member age
12 or older who experienced one or more
violent crimes. Simple assault was the
type of violent crime sustained by most
households. Twelve percent of households 
experienced one or more property crimes, 
with theft the most widely sustained. 
There were no real differences between 
2003 and 2004 in the percentage of 
households experiencing total crimes.

Both violent and property crime declined
between 1994 and 2004. The percentage of
U.S. households experiencing one or more
crimes dropped from 25% in 1994 to 14% in
2004. 

Fourteen percent of U.S. 
households experienced one or 
more crimes in 2004 
  
About 16 million households experienced 1
or more of the victimizations measured by
the NCVS, an ongoing household survey that
collects information about crimes both
unreported and reported to police. These
victimized households made up about 14% of
the 115.8 million households in the United
States. 

About 3% of households had an adolescent
or adult member who was victimized by one
or more crimes of violence during the
year. NCVS interviews all members of a
household age 12 or older and does not
estimate victimizations of children
younger than 12. The measured violent
crimes, which include rape, sexual
assault, robbery and simple and aggravated
assault, affected members of about 1 in
every 34 U.S. households. There were no
significant changes in violent crimes in
any of the categories between 2003 and
2004. About 2.3 million households had
members who experienced simple assault,
the most frequently encountered crime of
violence. Simple assault does not result
in serious injury and does not involve a
weapon.  

About 12% of all households in 2004
experienced one or more property crimes,
such as household burglary, motor vehicle
theft or property theft. Theft, affecting
1 in 10 households, was the most frequently 
encountered property crime.

There was some evidence that the percentage 
of households victimized by overall property 
crime decreased between 2003 and 2004. There 
was no change for household burglary, motor 
vehicle theft or property theft for these 
years. 

Few households experienced the 
same type of crime more than 
once

For the households-victimized-by-crime
measure, households that experienced the
same type of crime more than once were
counted only once for that victimization. 

In 2004, about 1% of households had members 
victimized by more than one type of violence, 
including rape, sexual assault, robbery, 
and assault. About 1% of households were 
victimized by both violent and property 
crimes. Such households were counted once 
in the violent crime measure, once in the 
property crime measure, and once in the 
overall measure. 

------------------------------------------
Vandalism of residences or other property
owned by an individual remains unchanged
Over 5.6 million households, 4.8% of all
U.S. households had at least one incident
of vandalism in 2004. First compiled by
the NCVS in 2000, vandalism is not
included in the overall measure of
households experiencing victimization. If
vandalism is included in the overall measure, 
the total percentage of households experiencing 
crime increases from 14% to 17%. There was 
no change in the percentage of households 
affected by vandalism between 2003 and 2004.
------------------------------------------

"Crimes of high concern" were 
experienced by 4% of households

Violence by strangers or household burglary 
are often cited as the most fear provoking 
crimes. The portion of these crimes has 
fallen since 1994 but did not change between 
2003 and 2004. About 1 in every 27 households 
experienced household burglary or had a 
household member who experienced violence 
by a stranger during 2004. About 4.3 
million households experienced these 
"crimes of high concern" in 2004.

Intimate partner violence affected 
about 1 in 250 households during 
2004

Less than 1% of all households experienced
intimate partner violence, which is
violence committed by a current or former
spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend). Intimate 
partner violence declined between 1994 and 
2004, but did not change between 2003 and 
2004. One or more members of about 458,000 
households experienced at least one intimate 
partner victimization during 2004. 

Black and Hispanic households 
were more vulnerable to crime 

In 2004 households headed by blacks were
more likely to experience crime (16%) 
than those headed by whites (14%).
Households headed by Hispanics were more
likely to sustain one or more crimes than
those headed by non-Hispanics (17% vs.
14%).

Prevalence of crime was higher for 
urban households, large households, 
and those in the West 

Households in urban areas (18%) were more
likely to experience one or more crimes
than suburban households (13%) and rural
households (12%) in 2004.

Household size affected the likelihood of
experiencing criminal victimization in
2004. Twenty-five percent of households 
with six or more persons experienced one 
or more crimes compared with 20% of 
households made up of four or five persons, 
14% of households with two or three persons, 
and 9% of one-person households.

Households located in the West were more
likely to experience one or more crimes
when compared with households in other
regions of the country. 

Prevalence of crime in households 
decreased from 1994 to 2004

About 14% of households experienced one or
more crimes in 2004, compared to about 25%
households in 1994. The percentage of 
households experiencing either violent or 
property crime also declined. In 2004, about 
3% of households had a member who experienced 
at least one violent crime, compared with 7% 
in 1991994.  For property crimes, 12% of households 
were affected in 2004, compared to 21% in 1994.

Methodology

This Bulletin presents data on non-lethal
violence and property crimes from the
National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS). In 2004, 84,360 households and
149,000 individuals age 12 or older were
interviewed. For the 2004 NCVS data
presented here, the response rate was
91.3% of eligible households and 85.5% of
eligible individuals.  

The households-victimized-by-crime measure
counts each household once for the calendar 
year, regardless of the number of times a 
household experienced a particular type of 
crime. For the overall indicator, household-
based crime estimates are derived from NCVS 
statistics on rape/sexual assault, robbery, 
assault, personal theft, household burglary,
household theft, and motor vehicle theft.
A household is counted if anyone in the
household experienced one or more of any
of these crimes within the year. For
categories such as violent crime by a
stranger or intimate partner crime, a
household is counted if person(s) in the
households were victimized one or more
times by that particular type of crime.

Detailed information about the construction 
of the households-victimized-by-crime 
measure, as well as data about households 
in prior years, is available in Crime and 
the Nation's Households, 2000, with Trends,
1994-2000 <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/
