Highlights
                 
In the year ending June 30, 2004 --

*  The number of inmates in custody in local jails rose 
by 22,689; in State prison by 15,375; and in Federal 
prison by 10,095.

*  The smaller State prison systems had the greatest
percentage increase: Minnesota (up 13.2%) and Montana
(up 10.5%). 

At midyear 2004 --

*  A total of 2,477 State prisoners were under age 18. 
Local jails held a total of 7,083 persons under age 18.

*  State and Federal correctional authorities held 91,789
noncitizens, up from 90,566 (1.4%) at midyear 2003.

*  In both jails and prisons, there were 123 female inmates
per 100,000 women in the United States, compared to 1,348 
male inmates per 100,000 men.

*  An estimated 12.6% of black males, 3.6% of Hispanic
males, and 1.7% of white males in their late twenties were
in prison or jail.

*  Local jails were operating 6% below their rated capacity.
In contrast, at yearend 2003 State prisons were estimated
to be at capacity to 16% above capacity, and Federal prisons 
were 39% above their rated capacity.

*  Privately operated prison facilities held 98,791 inmates
(up 3.4% since yearend 2003). The Federal system reported 
the largest increase among inmates in private prisons 
(up 2,641).
--------------------------------------------
                 
At midyear 2004 the Nation's prisons and jails incarcerated
2,131,180 persons. Prisoners in the custody of the 50
States and the Federal system accounted for two-thirds of
the incarcerated population (1,410,404 inmates). The other
third were held in local jails (713,990), not including
persons in community based programs.

On June 30, 2004, 1,494,216 prisoners were under Federal
and State jurisdiction, which includes inmates in custody
and persons under the legal authority of a prison system
but held outside its facilities. During the 12-month period
ending June 30, 2004, the number under State jurisdiction
rose 1.6%, while the number under Federal jurisdiction
rose 5.1%. Minnesota (up 13.2%), Montana (up 10.5%), 
Arkansas (up 8.9%), and Kentucky (up 8.5%) had the largest 
percentage increases. Twelve States had decreases, including 
Alabama(-6.7%), Connecticut (-2.5%), Ohio(-2.3%), and New 
York (-2.0%). 

At midyear 2004 local jail authorities held or supervised
784,538 offenders.  Nine percent of these offenders
(70,548) were supervised outside jail facilities in 
programs such as community service, work release, weekend
reporting, electronic monitoring, and other alternative
programs. 

Incarceration rate for Nation reaches 
726 per 100,000 residents 

On June 30, 2004, 1,410,404 inmates were in the custody of 
State and Federal prison authorities, and 713,990 inmates 
were in the custody of local jail authorities. In the
first 6 months of 2004, the Nation's prison population
increased 24,079 (1.7%). These data were collected in the
2004 National Prisoner Statistics program and the 2003
Annual Survey of Jails. (See Methodology, page 11, for a
description of data collections.)  

Since midyear 2003 the total incarcerated population has
increased 2.3% (table 1). Including inmates in public and
privately operated facilities, the number of inmates in 
State prisons increased 1.3%; in Federal prisons, 6.3%; 
and in local jails, 3.3%. At midyear 2004, Federal prisons
(including all secure and non-secure public and private
facilities) held 8.3% of all inmates, up from 5.6% in 1995. 
Between yearend 1995 and midyear 2004, the incarcerated
population grew an average of 3.5% annually. 

During this period the Federal and State prison populations
and the local jail population grew at the average annual
rates of 7.8%, 2.7%, and 4.1%, respectively.

In the 12 months before midyear 2004, the number of inmates 
in prison and jail rose an estimated 48,452 inmates, or 932 
inmates per week. 

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail in 2003 was 
726 inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents -- up from 716 at
midyear 2003. At midyear 2004,  1 in every 138 U.S.
residents were in prison or jail.

Federal system growth continues to outpace 
that of States  

The rate of growth of the State prison population slowed
between 1995 and 2001 and then began to rise. During this
time, the percentage change in the first 6 months of each
year steadily decreased, reaching a low of 0.6% in 2001,
and then rose to 1.5% in 2004. The percentage change in
the second 6 months of each year showed a similar trend,
resulting in an actual decrease in State prison 
populations for the second half of 2000 and 2001.  

Since 1995 the Federal system has grown at a much higher 
rate than the States, peaking at 6% growth in the first 
6 months of 1999. In the first 6 months of 2004, the
number of Federal inmates increased 3.6% (more than
twice the rate of State growth). 

Some of the Federal growth since 1999 has been the result
of the transfer of responsibility for housing sentenced
felons from the District of Columbia. The transfer to
Federal facilities was completed by yearend 2001. Since
then, the Federal system has continued to receive
sentenced felons from DC Superior Court. 

In absolute numbers, the total increase of 30,019 State 
and Federal prison inmates between July 1, 2003, and June 
30, 2004, was significantly lower than the growth during 
the previous 12-month period (44,260 inmates).

The percentage change from midyear 2003 to midyear 2004 
(2.1%) was also smaller the 2002-03 increase (3.1%). The 
average annual growth from 1995 to 2004 was 3.4%. 

Federal system accounts for over 25% 
of inmate population increase

Over a quarter of the growth (28%) in the Nation's prison
population during the 12 months ending June 30, 2004,
was accounted for by the 8,749 additional inmates under
jurisdiction of the Federal system. During this 12-month
period, several States also experienced substantial growth,
including Minnesota (13.2%), Montana (10.5%), and
Arkansas (8.9%).

Twelve States experienced a decline in their prison
population. Alabama had the largest percentage decrease
(-6.7%), followed by Connecticut(-2.5%), Ohio (-2.3%),
and New York (-2.0%). 

----------------------------------------------
Prison incarceration rates continue to rise

The incarceration rate of State and Federal prisoners
sentenced to more than 1 year was 486 per 100,000 U.S.
residents on June 30, 2004, up from 482 per 100,000 on
December 31, 2003. At midyear 2004, 12 States led by
Louisiana (814 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 State
residents), Texas (704), and Oklahoma (684), exceeded
the national rate. Nine States, including Maine (149),
Minnesota (169), and North Dakota (189) -- had rates 
that were less than half of the national rate.

Overall, the State incarceration rate rose about 14%
between yearend 1995 and midyear 2004, from 379 to 433
prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents. At the same time,
the Federal incarceration rate rose almost 66%, from 
32 to 53 prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents.

Since yearend 1995 the total number of sentenced inmates
per 100,000 residents has risen from 411 to 486. During
this period prison incarceration rates rose the most in 
the Midwest (from 310 to 378), followed by the West 
(from 358 to 421) and the South (from 483 to 543). The 
rate in the Northeast decreased slightly from 301 to 299. 


A quarter of inmates in private facilities 
held for Federal system 

In the first 6 months of 2004, the number of prisoners held
in privately operated facilities increased from 95,522 to
98,791, an increase of  3.4% (table 3). Overall, private
facilities held 6.6% of all State and Federal inmates, up
from 6.5% at midyear 2003. The Federal system (24,506),
Texas (16,906), Oklahoma (5,675), and Tennessee (5,121)
reported the largest number of inmates in private 
facilities at midyear 2004. Five States, all in the West, 
had at least a quarter of their prisoners in private 
facilities. 
-------------------------------------------------

Female inmate population continues 
to rise at a faster rate than male 
inmate population 

From June 30, 2003, to June 30, 2004, the number of women 
under the jurisdiction of State and Federal prison
authorities grew from 100,384 to 103,310, an increase of
2.9%. The number of men rose 2.0%, from 1,363,813 to
1,390,906. At midyear 2004, California, Texas, Florida, 
and the Federal system housed 4 of every 10 female 
inmates.

Since 1995 the annual rate of growth in the number of
female inmates has averaged 5.0%, higher than the 3.3%
average increase of male inmates. Women accounted for
6.9% of all inmates at midyear 2004, up from 6.1% at
yearend 1995.

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident population,
men were almost 15 times more likely than women to be
incarcerated in a State or Federal prison. On June 30,
2004, the rate for inmates serving a sentence of more 
than 1 year was 63 female inmates per 100,000 women in 
the United States, compared to 923 sentenced male 
inmates per 100,000 men. 

Number of State inmates under age 
18 continues to decline

A total of 2,477 State prisoners were under age 18 on 
June 30, 2004, down nearly 10% from 2,740 at midyear 
2003. The number of minors held in State prisons peaked 
in 1995 at 5,309, and has since decreased every year. 
Overall, 0.2% of all State prisoners were under age 18.

Eight States reported more than 100 prisoners under age
18 at midyear 2004, led by Connecticut (321), New York
(225), Florida (214), and Texas (210). Three of these
States reported an increase in their under age 18
populations held in prison during the 12 months ending
June 30, 2004, while the rest experienced declines. 

Six states reported no inmates under age 18, and another
twelve states had fewer than 10 inmates under age 18. 
At midyear 2004, 62% of noncitizen prisoners held in
State facilities; 38% in Federal facilities 

On June 30, 2004, 91,789 noncitizens were in the custody
of State or Federal correctional authorities, up from 
90,566 at midyear 2003. Overall, 6.5% of State and Federal
inmates at midyear 2004 were not U.S. citizens. The
noncitizen prisoner population increased between 1998
and 1999, and since then has remained nearly stable,
increasing about 3.4% between midyear 1999 and midyear
2004. 

At midyear 2004, 34,422 Federal inmates were noncitizens,
representing over 20% of all prisoners in Federal custody.
California (17,890), Texas (9,048), New York (8,027),
Florida (4,834), and Arizona (3,924) held over 75% of 
all noncitizens confined in State prison. Noncitizen 
prisoners accounted for over 10% of the prison 
populations of Arizona, New York, Nevada, and 
California.

Growth continues as rising admissions 
outpace releases

From 2000 to 2003 admissions to State prison rose 9.1%
(from 581,487 in 2000 to 634,149 in 2003). During 2003,
612,185 sentenced prisoners were released from State
prisons, up from 569,599 in 2000 -- an increase of 7.5%.

Admissions to the Federal prison system increased 19.6%
between 2000 and 2003 (from 43,732 to 52,288); releases
increased 25.2% (35,259 to 44,135). The number of
admissions to Federal prison in 2003 exceeded releases
by more than 8,000 inmates.

New court commitments on the rise 

Prior to 1998 growth in prison admissions reflected
increasing numbers of offenders returning for parole
violations. Between 1990 and 1998, the number of
returned parole violators increased 54% (from 133,870 
to 206,152), while the number of new court commitments
increased 7% (from 323,069 to 347,270). 

However, since 1998 parole violators returned to prison
increased by less than 2%, while new court commitments
rose 15.1%. 

At midyear the Nation's jails supervised 
784,538 persons

As defined in this report, jails are locally operated
correctional facilities that confine persons before or 
after adjudication. Inmates sentenced to jail usually 
have a sentence of 1 year or less, but jails also 
incarcerate persons in a wide variety of other 
categories. (See box below.) 

Based on the 2004 Annual Survey of Jails, the Nation's
local jails held or supervised 784,538 offenders on June
30, 2004. Jail authorities supervised 9% of these offenders
(70,548) in alternative programs outside the jail 
facilities. A total of 713,990 persons were housed in 
local jails.

---------------------------------------------
Jails --
*  receive individuals pending arraignment and hold 
them awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing

*  readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators 
and absconders

*  temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to 
juvenile authorities

*  hold mentally ill persons pending their movement 
to appropriate health facilities

*  hold individuals for the military, for protective 
custody, for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses

*  release convicted inmates to the community upon
completion of sentence

*  transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other 
authorities

*  house inmates for Federal, State, or other 
authorities because of crowding of their facilities

*  sometimes operate community- based programs as
alternatives to incarceration

*  hold inmates sentenced to short terms (generally 
under 1 year).
---------------------------------------------

Among persons under community supervision by jail staff
in 2003, 19% were required to perform community service
(13,171) and 16% participated in a weekend reporting
program (11,589). Seventeen percent of offenders in the
community were under electronic monitoring; 20% were
under other pretrial supervision; 3% were in a drug,
alcohol, mental health, or other type of medical 
treatment program; and 14% were participating in a work 
release or other alternative work program.

Number of jail inmates rose 22,700 
in 12 months ending June 30, 2004 

Between July 1, 2003, and June 30, 2004, the number of
persons held in local jail facilities grew 3.3% -- from
691,301 to 713,990. The 12-month increase was similar to
the average annual growth (3.9%) from midyear 1995 to
midyear 2004. The 3.3% growth in 2003 was less than last
year's increase of 3.9%. In absolute numbers, the total
increase of 22,689 inmates in 2004 was 3,100 less than
the increase in 2003 (25,826). 

Jail incarceration rates rose in 
last 12-month period

Since 1995 the Nation's jail population on a per capita
basis has increased 26%. During this period the number 
of jail inmates per 100,000 residents rose from 193 to 
243. 

When individuals under community supervision by jail
authorities are included with those in custody, the rate 
was 267 persons per 100,000 U.S. residents at midyear 
2004. 

An estimated total of 7,083 persons under age 18 were
housed in adult jails on June 30, 2004. Nearly 9 in 10 
of these young inmates had been convicted or were being
held for trial as adults in criminal court. The average 
daily population for the year ending June 30, 2004, was 
706,242, an increase of 3.7% from 2003 and 38.5% from 
1995.

Characteristics of jail inmate population 
changing gradually

Male inmates made up 87.7% of the local jail inmate
population at midyear 2004 -- 2.1 percentage points lower
than at midyear 1995.  During the 12-month period ending
June 30, 2004, the number of adult female inmates rose
6.6%, while the number of adult male inmates increased
2.8%. On average the adult female jail population has
grown 7.0% annually in the past 10 years, while the adult
male inmate population has grown 4.2%. 

At midyear 2004 nearly 6 in 10 persons in local jails were
racial or ethnic minorities. Whites made up 44.4% of the 
jail population; blacks, 38.6%; Hispanics, 15.2%; and other
races (Asians, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native
Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders), 1.8%.

On a per capita basis, men were over 7 times more likely
than women to have been held in a local jail on June 30,
2004. Blacks were nearly 5 times more likely than whites,
nearly 3 times more likely than Hispanics, and over 8 
times more likely than persons of other races to have 
been in jail.


On June 30, 2004, 60% of the Nation's jail inmates were
awaiting court action on their current charge. An 
estimated 283,500 inmates held in local jails were serving 
a sentence in jail, awaiting sentencing, or serving time 
for a probation or parole violation. As a percent of all 
jail inmates, the percent convicted has dropped from 44.0% 
at midyear 2000 to 39.7% at midyear 2004.

At midyear 2004, 94% of jail 
capacity occupied

In the 12 months ending June 30, 2004, fewer beds 
than inmates were added to the Nation's jails. At 
midyear 2004 the rated capacity of local jails was 
estimated at 755,603 beds, an increase of 19,132 in 
12 months. In the same 12 month period, an additional 
22,689 inmates were added to the local jail population. 

Rated capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates
allocated by State or local rating officials to each jail 
facility. The growth in jail capacity during the 12-month 
period ending on June 30, 2004, (22,572) was less than the
average growth of 25,128 beds every 12 months since
midyear 1995, but was more than the growth in the number
of beds during 2001 (21,522) and 2002 (14,590). 

As of June 30, 2004, 94% of the local jail capacity was
occupied.**Footnote On December 31, 2003, State prisons
were estimated to be at capacity to 16% above capacity,
while Federal prisons were operating at 39% above
capacity. See Prisoners in 2003, November 2004, NCJ
205335.** As a ratio of all inmates housed in jail 
facilities to total capacity, the percentage occupied 
decreased by 10 percentage points from 1990 to 2004. At 
midyear 1990 local jails operated at 4% above their rated 
capacity. 

Jail jurisdictions with an average daily population greater
than 250 reported the highest occupancy rates (97%). At
the same time, jail jurisdictions with an average daily
population of fewer than 50 inmates were operating at 64%
of rated capacity, compared to 66% in at midyear 2003. 

The 50 largest jail jurisdictions housed 
about a third of jail inmates 

On June 30, 2004, the Nation's 50 largest jail jurisdictions
held 30.9% (220,556) of all jail inmates. Twenty States had
at least one jurisdiction which ranked in the top 50 for
average daily population. States with more than one
jurisdiction among the 50 largest jail jurisdictions are
California (10), Florida (8), Texas (7), Georgia (4), 
Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (2), and Tennessee (2).

The 2 jurisdictions with the most inmates, Los Angeles
County and New York City, together held approximately
32,400 inmates, or nearly 5% of the national total. 

Seventeen jurisdictions among the 50 largest experienced
a decrease in the number of inmates held between July 1,
2003, and June 30, 2004. Jurisdictions with double-digit
decreases were De Kalb, Georgia (down 16.8%), Essex
County, New Jersey (down 12.6%), and Orange County,
Florida (down 10.2%). 

Excluding the District of Columbia, 8 jail jurisdictions
among the 50 largest experienced double-digit growth. The
jurisdiction with the largest increase in jail population 
was Clark County, Nevada (up 20.5%). Other jail 
jurisdictions with substantial population increases were 
Fulton County, Georgia (up 20.2%), Orange County, 
California (up 20.1%), Milwaukee County, Wisconsin 
(up 16.5%), and Baltimore City, Maryland (up 15.4%). 

Twenty of the 50 largest jail jurisdictions operated over 
their rated capacities. On June 30, 2004, Maricopa County,
Arizona, operated at 176% of their capacity; Polk County,
Florida, operated at 138%; and Fulton County, Georgia,
operated at 131% of capacity.

An estimated 12% of black males in their 
late twenties in prison or jail in 2004

When total incarceration rates are estimated separately by
age group, black males in their twenties and thirties are
found to have high rates relative to other groups. Among
the more than 2.1 million offenders incarcerated on June
30, 2004, an estimated 576,600 were black males between
ages 20 and 39.

Among males age 25 to 29, 12.6% of blacks were in prison
or jail, compared to 3.6% of Hispanics and about 1.7% of
whites. 

Although incarceration rates drop with age, the percentage
of black males age 45 to 54 in prison or jail in 2004 was 
an estimated 4.5% -- more than  twice the highest rate 
(1.7%)among white males (age 30 to 34).

Female incarceration rates, though significantly lower than
male rates at every age, reveal similar racial and ethnic
differences. Black females (with a prison and jail rate of
359 per 100,000) were 2½ times more likely than Hispanic
females (143 per 100,000) and nearly 4½ times more likely
than white females (81 per 100,000) to be incarcerated in
2004. These differences among white, black, and Hispanic
females were consistent across all age groups.

Among black females, the rate was highest (993 per
100,000) among those age 35 to 39. This rate was more
than 4 times higher than the rate among white females 
in this age group (238 per 100,000).

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics (NPS)

The Bureau of Justice Statistics, with the U.S. Census
Bureau as its collection agent, obtains yearend and
midyear counts of prisoners from departments of correction
in each of the 50 States and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 

NPS distinguishes between prisoners in custody from
those under jurisdiction. To have custody of a 
prisoner, a State must hold that person in one of its 
facilities. To have jurisdiction, a State has legal 
authority over the prisoner. Prisoners under a State's 
jurisdiction may be in the custody of a local jail, 
another State's prison, or other correctional facility 
such as a privately operated institution. Some States
are unable to provide both custody and jurisdiction 
counts. 

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in locally
administered confinement facilities who are under the
jurisdiction of local authorities. NPS counts include all
inmates in State-operated facilities in Alaska, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, 
which have combined jail-prison systems. (See National 
Prisoner Statistics jurisdiction notes, on the BJS Web 
site.)

Annual Survey of Jails, 2004

In each of the years between the full censuses, a sample
survey of jails is conducted to estimate baseline
characteristics of the Nation's jails and the inmates 
housed in these jails. Based on information from the 
1999 Census of Jails, a sample of jail jurisdictions was 
selected for the 2004 survey. A jurisdiction is a county 
(parish in Louisiana)or municipal government that 
administers one or more local jails. The sample included 
all jail facilities (940) in 878 jurisdictions. 

In drawing the sample, all multi-jurisdictional(55) jails 
were included in the sample with certainty. These jails 
are operated jointly by two or more jurisdictions. Other
jurisdictions (356) were included automatically in the
sample if their jails held juvenile inmates on census day
and had an average daily population of 250 or more inmates, 
or if their jails held only adults and had an average daily 
population of 500 or more. 

The remaining jurisdictions were stratified into two groups:
jurisdictions with jails holding at least one juvenile on 
June 30, 1999, and jurisdictions with jails holding adults 
only. Using stratified probability sampling, 467 
jurisdictions were then selected from 10 strata based on 
the average daily population in the 1999 census.

Data were obtained by mailed and web-based survey
questionnaires.

After follow-up phone calls to respondents, the response
rate for the survey was 100% for critical items such as
rated capacity, average daily population, and number of
inmates confined. (For standard errors, see Appendix
tables, Annual Survey of Jails 2004, on the BJS Web site.)
