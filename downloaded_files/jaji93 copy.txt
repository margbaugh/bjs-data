The number of inmates held in the Nation's local jails on June 30, 1994,
reached a record high of 490,442.  Local jails, which are operated by
counties and municipalities and administered by local government
agencies, housed about a third of all persons incarcerated in the U.S. at
midyear 1994; the other two-thirds were in State or Federal prisons.

The jail population grew by 30,638 inmates between July 1, 1993, and
June 30, 1994, the third largest annual increase recorded since 1983.  The
12-month increase was the equivalent of a 6.7% rate of growth.

Between 1983 and 1993, when comparable statistics were collected, the
number of local jail employees grew at a faster rate than the number of
inmates.  During this period, the number of jail inmates increased at an
annual rate of 7.5%, while the number of full-time and part-time jail
employees grew at an annual rate of 10%.  By midyear 1993, local jails
employed an estimated 165,500 persons.

Highlights

After a decade of record growth, the number of inmates in local jails
reached a high of 490,442 on June 30, 1994

* The number of jail inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents increased from
96 in 1983 to 188 in 1994.

* In 1993, 8 States had over 200 local jail inmates per 100,000 residents:
Louisiana (377), Georgia (328), Texas (307), Tennessee (282), Florida
(250), Virginia (225), California (222), and Nevada (215).  

* Between 1983 and 1993 the number of jail inmates increased 106%; the
total jail staff increased 156%; and the number of correctional officers
grew 165%.

* At midyear 1994 the capacity of the Nation's local jails was 504,324
inmates, as measured by the number of beds allotted by State or local
rating officials.  

* The jail population was 97% of rated capacity.  Jail space increased
93% between 1983 and 1994.

* White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jail population; black
non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and non-Hispanics of other races,
2%.

Factors underlying the growth in the Nation's jail population included:

* an increase in adult arrests 
* a growth in jail admissions
* an increased number of felons sentenced to local jails
* an increased number of inmates charged with or convicted of drug
offenses
* more inmates held in jails because of crowded State or Federal facilities.

Data sources

The data in this report are based on results from the 1993 Census of Jails
and the 1994 Annual Survey of Jails. Every 5 years the jail census
collections provide detailed information on local jail inmates, staff,
facilities, and programs.  Previous censuses were conducted in 1970,
1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988.  Beginning in 1982 and in years between
each jail census, a sample of jails has been surveyed to obtain basic
information on inmates and jail capacity.  These annual surveys provide
national-level estimates on fewer characteristics than the census. (See
Methodology at end.)

As defined in this report, jails are locally operated correctional facilities
that confine persons before or after adjudication.  Inmates sentenced to jail
usually have a sentence of a year or less, but jails also incarcerate persons
in a wide variety of other categories. 

Jails--
* receive individuals pending 
arraignment and hold them awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing
* readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and absconders
* temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to juvenile authorities
* hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to appropriate health
facilities
* hold individuals for the military, 
for protective custody, for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses
* release convicted inmates to the community upon completion of sentence
* transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other authorities
* relinquish custody of temporary detainees to juvenile and medical
authorities
* sometimes operate community-based programs with electronic
monitoring or other types of supervision.

Not included in the survey or census are inmates in six States with
combined jail and prison systems.  At midyear 1994 these States--Alaska
(except for 5 local jails), Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island,
and Vermont--held nearly 6,000 inmates who were unsentenced or had
sentences of less than a year.  These inmates and the facilities that house
them are included in BJS prison statistics. 

The 1993 Census of Jails also included, for the first time, seven Federal
facilities that perform the pretrial functions of local jails.  Data on these
Federal facilities and inmates are reported separately.  (See the section on
Federal jails.)

Local jail inmates

On June 30, 1994, the Nation's jails held 490,442 inmates, an increase of
6.7% over the number held on June 30, 1993.  The jail population grew
by more than 30,000 inmates during the 12-month period, the third largest
increase ever recorded.

Since 1983 the jail inmate population has nearly doubled on a per capita
basis.  During this period, the number of jail inmates per 100,000
residents rose from 96 to 188.  At midyear 1994 about 1 in every 398
adult residents of the United States was in a local jail.  

An estimated 6,725 persons under age 18 were housed in adult jails on
June 30, 1994.  Over three-quarters of them had been convicted or were
being held for trial as adults in criminal court.  Most juveniles in
correctional custody are housed in juvenile facilities. 

Who is a juvenile?

Most, but not all, States define a juvenile as a person under age 18 who
is subject to juvenile court jurisdiction.  Exceptions usually depend on
offense severity or an offender's adjudication history.

In the 1993 census and 1994 survey, to achieve reporting uniformity, jail
authorities were asked to report the number of inmates under age 18.  Of
the 6,725 total in 1994, 76% were identified as juveniles tried or
scheduled to be tried as adults.  

Statutes and judicial practice some- times allow youths to be held in adult
jails.  Often juveniles accused of acts that are crimes for adults may be
held in local jails or police lockups, given certain conditions:
* separated by sight and sound from the general population 
* held for a limited time, typically less than 6 hours.

Most confined juveniles are housed in institutions specified for them.  In
1993 about 96,000 were in public and private juvenile detention and
correctional facilities.

The average daily population for the year ending June 30, 1994, was
479,757, an increase of 2.9% from 1993.  Between 1983 and 1993, when
separate counts by sex were collected, the average daily population of
female inmates grew at a faster rate (up 11.1% per year) than the average
daily population of adult male inmates (up 7.1% per year).  

States with the largest jail populations

In 1993, 5 States incarcerated slightly less than half of all local jail
inmates: California (69,298 inmates), Texas (55,395), Florida (34,183),
New York (29,809), and Georgia (22,663).  Twenty-one States reported
a jailpopulation that more than doubled between 1983 and 1993, with
growth ranging from 103% in Maryland to 264% in Texas. 

States that had the largest number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents in
1993 were Louisiana (377), Georgia (328), Texas (307), Tennessee (282),
Florida (250), Virginia (225), California (222), and Nevada (215).  States
with a jail incarceration rate less than half that of the Nation (178 per
100,000) were Iowa, Maine, and North Dakota (57), Minnesota and
Montana (81), and South Dakota (87).

The number of local jail inmates rose the most in the South and the least
in the Midwest.  From 1983 to 1993 the inmate population grew 135% in
the South, 102% in the Northeast, 81% in the West, and 79% in the
Midwest.  

For the Nation a declining number of jails held these increasing numbers
of inmates.  In 1993 the total of 3,304 facilities was 12 fewer than 5 years
before and 34 fewer than in 1983.

Facility size and the percentage of the inmate population held

A small number of jails held a disproportionate share of the Nation's jail
inmates.  About 6% of the jail facilities housed more than half of all jail
inmates on June 30, 1993.  Facilities with an average daily population of
500 or more during the annual period ending June 30, 1993, held 53% of
local jail inmates.  Facilities with an average daily population of fewer
than 50 persons comprised 57% of all jails but housed about 8% of all
inmates.

Demographic characteristics of local jail inmates

Male inmates made up 90% of the local jail inmate population at midyear
1994, down from 93% in 1983.  An estimated 1 in every 212 adult men
and 1 in every 2,048 adult women were held in a local jail on June 30,
1994.

On June 30, 1994, a majority of local jail inmates were black or Hispanic.
White non-Hispanics made up 39% of the jail population; black
non-Hispanics, 44%; Hispanics, 15%; and other races (Asians, Pacific
Islanders, American Indians and Alaska Natives), 2%.

Relative to the number 
of residents in the U.S. population, black non-Hispanics were more than
twice as likely as Hispanics, nearly 7 times more likely than white
non-Hispanics, and over 9 times more likely than persons of other races
to have been held in a local jail on June 30, 1994.

Note:  U.S. resident populations were estimated.  Inmate counts were
adjusted for nonresponse and rounded to the nearest 100. Rates were
based on relevant population subgroups.         

Adult conviction status, mid-1993

On June 30, 1993, the most recent date for available data, at least half the
Nation's adult jail inmates had been convicted on their current charge. 
Convicted inmates include those awaiting sentencing, serving a sentence,
or returned to jail for a violation of probation or parole.  Between 1983
and 1993 the reported number of convicted inmates more than doubled
(from 107,660 to 226,600).  The number of jail inmates awaiting court
disposition also doubled (from 113,984 to 228,900).

In 1993 female inmates were somewhat more likely than male inmates 
to have been convicted.  Among adult female inmates, 52% had been
convicted on their current charge, compared to 50% of the male inmates.

Rated capacity and percent occupied

At midyear 1994, the rated capacity of the Nation's local jails totaled
504,324.  Rated capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates
allocated by State or local rating officials to each jail facility.  During the
12 months ending June 30, 1994, an estimated 29,100 beds were added. 
Nearly a quarter of a million beds have been added since 1983.

As of June 30, 1994, 97% of the local jail capacity was occupied.  As
measured by a ratio of the number of inmates housed in jail facilities to
the rated capacity, the percent of capacity actually occupied may have
been somewhat lower than 97%.  Included among the total jail inmates
were an unknown number of inmates housed outside of jail
facilities--under electronic monitoring, on house arrest, under other kinds
of community supervision, or temporarily in hospitals or treatment
centers. 

As a ratio of all inmates to capacity, the percent of capacity occupied
increased considerably after 1983, reaching a record 108% in 1989 and
then falling to 97% in 1993.  Since 1989 rated capacity has risen by
nearly 137,000 beds, while the number of inmates has increased by
95,000.       

In 1993 the total jail population exceeded jail capacity in eight States and
the District of Columbia.

                      Percent of jail

Virginia                    160%
South Carolina              124
District of Columbia        121
New Jersey                  120

Washington                  102
Pennsylvania                101

In eight other States, excluding Alaska, the total jail population was below
75% of the combined capacity of all local jails.  The lowest occupancy
rates were in North Dakota (43%), followed by Wyoming (52%), South
Dakota (54%), and Montana (60%). 
  
Between 1988 and 1993 the capacity of the Nation's local jails increased
by 40%, from 339,949 beds to 475,224.  In eight States the capacity of
local jails increased by more than 60% during the 5-year period.  Jails in
New Hampshire and Massachusetts experienced the largest percentage
increase in capacity.  During this period the combined capacities of jails
declined in the following jurisdictions:  West Virginia, Montana, and the
District of Columbia.

In every census year, facilities with the largest average daily populations
have reported the highest occupancy rates.  In 1993 occupancy was 111%
of rated capacity in jails with an average population of 1,000 or more
inmates, compared to 67% in those with fewer than 50 inmates. 

The 25 largest jail jurisdictions

In 1994 the Nation's 25 largest jail jurisdictions accounted for 30% of all
jail inmates.  The jurisdictions were in 12 States:  7 in California; 5 in
Texas; 4 in Florida; and 1 each in New York, Illinois, Louisiana,
Tennessee, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Georgia, and Michigan. 
New York City's system, with 15 institutions, had the largest number of
facilities.

The two jurisdictions with the most inmates, Los Angeles County and
New York City, together held more than 38,284, or 8% of the national
total.

Overall, the 25 largest jurisdictions on June 30, 1994, had a total
population of 149,082 inmates, 10% more than the 135,060 a year earlier. 
In 1994, 15 jurisdictions reported having a larger average daily population
than in 1993.

Dallas County, Texas, reported the largest single year growth--2,123
inmates--and the largest growth from 1988 to 1994--5,494.  Shelby
County (Memphis), Tennessee, reported the largest decrease from 1993
to 1994--1,327 inmates.  

Local jail employees

Local jails employed an estimated 165,500 persons on June 30, 1993. 
Including all full-time and part-time, payroll and nonpayroll staff, the total
staff grew by more than 100,000 between 1983 and 1993, an increase of
156%. 

The staff total included 117,900 correctional officers, the employees most
responsible for providing a secure environment and for directly
supervising inmates.  Correctional officers comprised about 7 in every 10
jail employees in the 3 censuses, 1983-93. 

Characteristics of local jail staff
 
At midyear 1993 men comprised 70% of all paid jail staff and 76% of
correctional officers.  Excluded were nonpayroll jail employees, such as
teachers or counselors, who were paid by agencies other than jails. 

Between 1988 and 1993 the female staff in local jails nearly doubled, from
25,642 to an estimated 48,000.  In 1993 nearly a third of all paid staff and
a quarter of correctional officers were women.

The race and ethnic composition of jail staff remained unchanged between
1988 and 1993.  White employees made up an estimated 71% of  the
payroll jail staff in 1993, including 69% of the correctional officers. 
Blacks comprised 22% of all employees, including 23% of the
correctional officers.  Hispanics accounted for 6% of the total paid staff
and 7% of correctional officers.

Inmate-to-staff ratios, 1993 

From 1983 to 1993 the number of U.S. jail employees increased 156%,
as the number of correctional officers went up 165%.  Jail staffs in the
Northeast had the largest percentage increases--more than tripling in 10
years--while those in the Midwest had the smallest, more than doubling.

The South, the region with the largest number of jail employees,
registered the greatest regional growth (75%) from 1988 to 1993.  The
West, with less than half the number of employees in the South, also had
the least growth in staff (50%). 

Throughout the period, 1983-93, the jail staff in the Nation and in every
region grew more rapidly than the inmate population.  In 1993 jails held
2.8 inmates per employee.  The ratio in 1993 was almost a fifth lower
than the 3.4 inmates per employee in 1988.  

As a measure of workload, the number of inmates per correctional officer
also declined, from 4.7 in 1988 to 3.9 in 1993.  All four regions had
decreases in inmate-to-correctional officer ratios.  The West reported the
sharpest decline, from 7.1 inmates per officer in 1983 to 5.3  in 1993.

The smaller facilities had fewer inmates per correctional officer (2.4) than
did larger jails (4.6 inmates per officer in the jails with a 1,000 or more
inmates). The jails that were operating with an inmate population at least
10% over their rated capacity had an inmate-to-correctional officer ratio
almost twice that of jails with less than 75% of capacity occupied.  Jails
with 91% to 110% of capacity filled employed a correctional officer for
more than every 4 inmates.

Annual jail expenditures

Local jails throughout the United States spent a total of slightly over $9.6
billion during the year ending June 30, 1993.  This estimated total (not
adjusted for inflation) was more than double the $2.7 billion spent in
1983.

Approximately 71% of all reporting facilities were able to provide data on
expenditures in 1993.  These jails reported total annual expenditures were
nearly $7.8 billion; operating costs, about $5.5 billion; and capital
expenditures, $2.2 billion.  

Gross salaries and wages, employer contributions to employee benefits,
purchases of food, supplies, contractual services, and other current
operating costs accounted for 71% of expenditures.  Construction costs,
major repairs, equipment, improvements, land purchases, and other capital
outlays accounted for the remaining 29%.  In 1988, operating costs made
up 78% of all expenditures and capital outlays, 22%.

Average operating cost per inmate

Excluding capital outlays in 1993, the average cost to keep one jail inmate
incarcerated for a year was $14,667.  Over 10 years the cost per inmate
had risen 57% from $9,360.  (Adjusted for inflation to 1983 dollars the
annual cost per inmate had decreased by 11%.)  

The Northeast had the highest average operating expenditure per inmate
($22,678) and the South, the lowest ($11,697).  Excluding Alaska and the
District of Columbia, average annual operating costs per inmate by State
were highest in New York ( $29,297) and lowest in Mississippi ($7,014).

Inmate deaths 

During the year ending June 30, 1993, 647 inmate deaths occurred in the
jurisdiction of the jail authorities who provided data on such deaths. 
Although asked to report the death of inmates under the jurisdiction of jail
authorities, regardless of where the death took place, some facilities could
report only deaths that occurred on the jail premises.  In addition, about
10% of all jails were unable to report whether any inmate deaths had
occurred in 1993.

In 1993 illness was the leading cause of death in local jails (45%),
followed by suicide (36%).  Acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS) accounted for about 10% of reported inmate deaths; homicide,
3%; and other causes, 6%. 
 
The death rate among jail inmates fell by more than a third between 1983
and 1993, from 232 to 149 per 100,000 inmates.  While the rate of death
from illness, including AIDS, remained relatively constant over the
period, the rate of suicide declined sharply, from 129 per 100,000 in
1983, to 85 in 1988, to 54 in 1993. 

Federal jails

In 1993 the Federal Bureau of Prisons maintained a small number of
detention facilities that functioned as jails.  These were not counted among
the city, county, or regional adult detention facilities called local jails in
this report.  Local facilities, however, did hold about 12,000 persons for
Federal authorities, according to data reported by 90% of all facilities.

At midyear 1993 the Bureau of Prisons operated 7 jails, holding 5,899
persons who were awaiting adjudication or serving a sentence, usually of
a year or less.

Inmate demographics

Ninety-three percent of Federal jail inmates were men, a slightly higher
proportion than in local jails (90%).  Seventy-two percent were white,
25% were black, and 3% were Asians, Pacific Islanders, American
Indians, or Alaska Natives.  

Conviction status

Slightly more than half of the Federal inmates were unconvicted and were
awaiting arraignment, trial, or the completion of their trial. 

Facility capacity

The 7 Federal jails had a combined rated capacity of  3,810--the
population being 155% of that capacity.  The percent occupied was about 
50% higher than that of local jails of comparable size.

Inmate deaths

Eight inmates died while under the jurisdiction of Federal jail authorities
during the annual period ending  June 30, 1993.  Four deaths resulted
from illness or natural causes, two were suicides, and two were drug
overdoses.

Staff 

Seventy-five percent of Federal jail employees were male, a higher
percentage than the 70% of employees for local facilities.  A majority of
the Federal jail employees were correctional officers.

Overall, there were 2.9 inmates per staff member in Federal jails, about
the same as in local facilities where the ratio was 2.8 inmates per
employee.  However, the number of inmates per correctional officer (5.5)
was higher than in local jails with 500 to 999 inmates (4.4).

Expenditures

Federal jail expenditures totaled slightly more than $166 million during
the annual period ending  June 30, 1993, excluding those at the
Guaynabo, Puerto Rico, facility, in operation only a few months at the
time of the census.  Gross salaries and wages, contributions to employee
benefits, purchases of food, supplies, contractual services, and other
current operating costs accounted for 76% of expenditures.  Construction
costs, major repairs, equipment, improvements, land purchases, and other
capital outlays made up the remaining 24%.

The average cost to house one Federal jail inmate during the year ending
June 30, 1993,  exclusive of capital expenditures was $22,773, as
compared to $14,667 among local jails.

Factors behind the growing jail population

An increasing number of arrests

Underlying the dramatic growth of the Nation's local jail population after
1983 was a rise in the number of arrests from 11.7 million in 1983 to
14.0 million in 1993.  Over the 10-year period, the total number of arrests
grew at an annual rate of 1.8%.  For some offenses the annual rate of
growth was substantially greater:  simple assault (7.6%), aggravated
assault (5.8%), drug abuse violations (5.4%), and weapons violations
(3.9%).  

The increase in arrests resulted in a growing number of admissions to
local jails.  On June 30, 1993, an estimated 26,800 persons were officially
booked and admitted to local jails, and an additional 9,500 inmates were
transferred in from other facilities or readmitted after having been
temporarily released.  The estimated number of new admissions totaled
nearly 9.8 million for 1993, up from an estimated 6.0 million in the
annual period ending June 30, 1983. 

Among inmates facing felony charges, the likelihood of being held in a
local jail prior to the disposition of their case remained nearly the same
between 1988 and 1992.  Based on the biennial National Pretrial
Reporting Program (NPRP) that describes State felony defendants in the
Nation's 75 most populous counties, an estimated 37% were held awaiting
disposition in 1992.  Roughly the same percentage was detained in 1988
(34%) and 1990 (35%). (Pretrial Release of Felony Defendants, BJS
Bulletins, 1988 [February 1991, NCJ-127202], 1990 [November 1992,
NCJ-139560], and 1992 [November 1994, NCJ-148818]).

More felons sentenced to local jail

The impact of more arrests and jail admissions was compounded by a
growing number of felons receiving a sentence to local jail.  Between
1986 and 1992 the number of convicted felons sentenced to confinement
in local jails almost doubled:

Jail inmates received about the same average sentences

Growth in the local jail population between 1983 and 1993 was not the
result of longer sentences.  Results from the National Judicial Reporting
Program (NJRP) indicate that between 1988 and 1992, years in which
comparable data on felons sentenced to local jails are available, the
average (mean) maximum jail sentence among those entering jail remained
constant.  In 1988 and 1992 felons sentenced to local jail received a mean
sentence of 7 months. (Felony Sentences in State Courts, BJS Bulletins,
1988 [December 1990, NCJ-126923], 1990 [March 1993, NCJ-149077],
and 1992 [January 1995, NCJ-151167]).

Data from the 1983 and 1989 surveys of inmates in local jails also reveal
no significant changes in the sentence lengths received by sentenced
inmates overall, including felons and misdemeanants.  About 50% of the
jail inmates had been convicted and sentenced at the time of both sur-
veys.  (Profile of Jail Inmates, 1989, BJS Special Report [April 1991,
NCJ-129097]).  Between 1983 and 1989, there was an increase in the
mean sentence (from 14 months to 17 months) but no change in the
median.  In both years half of the sentenced inmates had received a
sentence of 6 months or less.

More drug offenders incarcerated in local jails

The largest source of growth among inmates in local jails was drug law
violators.  Based on data from inmate surveys in 1983 and 1989, the
number of jail inmates charged or convicted of drug offenses rose from
20,800 to 91,000.   In 1983 about 1 of every 10 inmates were in jail for
a drug offense; in 1989 nearly 1 of every 4 were in jail for drugs.  From
1983 to 1989 the increase in the number of persons in jail for drug
offenses accounted for more than 40 percent of the total increase in the
jail population. 

Between 1983 and 1989 the percentage of jail inmates decreased for
violent offenses (from 30.7% to 22.5%) and property offenses (from
38.6% to 30.0%), but increased for public-order offenses (from 20.6% to
22.8%).  During this period, the total number of inmates increased in
every category:  violent offenders increased from 68,600 to 89,000;
property offenders from 86,300 to 118,700; and public-order offenders
from 46,100 to 90,200.
 
Although offense information for more recent years is not available,
estimates may be made using 1989 percentages.  Assuming no change in
the percentage distributions, the estimated number of drug offenders in
local jails in 1993 was more than 105,800, representing a 5-fold increase
since 1983.

More jail inmates held for State/Federal authorities

The Nation's jail population also grew between 1983 and 1993 as a result
of crowding in State and Federal prisons.  On June 30, 1993, nearly 12%
of all jail inmates were prisoners being held for State or Federal
authorities.  An estimated 53,900 inmates were held for State or Federal
authorities in 1993, up from 17,281 
in 1983. 
 
Between 1983 and 1993 the number of inmates held for State and Federal
authorities grew at twice the rate of the inmate population overall (212%
compared with 106%).

Approximately 34,200 jail inmates in 1993 were in local facilities as a
direct result of crowding of State or Federal facilities (representing 7.4%
of all jail inmates).  The other 19,700 inmates held for State or Federal
authorities were in jail for other reasons, such as waiting transfer or early
release (pending completion of paperwork or transportation), participation
in special programs, and special security needs.

Methodology

Census of Jails

The 1993 Census of Jails was the sixth in a series of data collection
efforts aimed at studying the Nation's locally administered jails. Previous
censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, and 1988.  As in
previous censuses, the U.S. Bureau of the Census collected the data for
the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

The 1993 census included all locally administered confinement facilities
(3,287) that hold inmates beyond arraignment and are staffed by municipal
or county employees.  The census also included 17 jails that were
privately operated under contract for local governments and 7 facilities
maintained by BOP and functioning as jails.

Excluded from the census were temporary holding facilities, such as drunk
tanks and police lockups, that do not hold persons after being formally
charged in court (usually within 72 hours of arrest).  Also excluded were
State-operated facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode
Island, and Vermont, which have combined jail-prison systems.  Five
locally operated jails in Alaska were included.

The mailing list used for the census was derived from the National Justice
Agency List, which is maintained by the Bureau of the Census for BJS. 
The census forms were mailed to 3,506 facilities on June 22, 1993. 
Twenty-eight jails were added to the initial mail out, and 230 were
deleted, resulting in a total of 3,304 facilities.

After extensive follow-up, including additional mail requests and repeated
telephone contacts, all jails (except those in one jurisdiction) provided data
for four critical data items--number of inmates, average daily population,
rated capacity, and sex of inmates housed.  Data on the these four items
for the nonresponding jails were imputed based on data reported in the
1994 Annual Survey of Jails.  
 
Completed forms with data for all or most items were received for 2,981
jails, resulting in a 90% response rate.  These reporting jails housed 93%
of all local jail inmates on June 30, 1993.

Estimation procedures
 
Because there was nonresponse and incomplete data on all census items
except the four critical items, national totals had to be estimated.  The
following procedures were used to estimate totals when data were
incomplete:

1.  Each item was first assessed for coverage and internal consistency. 
For purposes of estimating the totals, extreme values were examined and
then verified by checking other census information or calling the
respondents.  Detailed categories were also checked to determine if they
summed to the reported totals.   

2.  To provide a national total, item values were summed and then
multiplied by a nonresponse adjustment factor (NAF).  For most
estimates, the NAF was a ratio of the total number of inmates in all jails
to the number of inmates in jails that reported valid data.  Ratios based on
inmate counts were used to estimate the number of adults, the number of
inmates by sex and age, conviction status by sex, the number of staff by
occupational category and region (tables 11 and 13), and payroll staff by
sex and race.  Ratios based on the total average daily population were
used to estimate total expenditures.

3.  Estimates of detailed categories were further adjusted so that for each
item the sum of the detail equaled the estimated total.  For example, the
estimated numbers of male and female adult inmates were ratio adjusted
so that the final estimates summed to the total number of adult inmates.

4.  All estimates of inmates and staff were rounded to the nearest 100. 
Expenditures were rounded to the nearest million dollars.

5.  All rates, ratios, and percentage distributions in this report are based
on reported data only.

Annual Survey of Jails

In each of the 4 years between the full censuses, a survey of jails is
conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the Nation's jails and
inmates housed in these jails.  The 1994 Annual Survey of Jails is the 10th
such survey in a series begun in 1982.  The reference date for the 1994
survey was June 30, 1994.

Using information from the 1993 Census of Jails, a new sample of jail
jurisdictions was selected for the 1994 survey.  A jurisdiction is a county
(parish in Louisiana) or municipal government that administers one or
more local jails.  The sample included all jails in 796 selected jail
jurisdictions and 23 multijurisdiction jails.  A multi-jurisdiction jail is one
in which two or more jurisdictions have a formal  agreement to operate
the facility. 

In drawing the sample for 1994, jail jurisdictions were first stratified into
two groups: single jurisdiction jails and multijurisdiction jails.  All of the
multi-jurisdiction jails were included in the survey.  The remaining
jurisdictions were then further stratified into two groups:  jurisdictions
with jails authorized to hold juveniles and jurisdictions with jails holding
only adults.  Jurisdictions were then selected based on the average daily
population in the 1993 census.  All jails in 203 jurisdictions were
automatically included if the jurisdiction held juveniles and had an average
daily population of 250 or more inmates in 1993 or if they held only
adults and had an average population of 500 or more.  The other
jurisdictions (593) were then selected based on stratified probability
sampling.

Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires.  After follow-up phone calls
to nonrespondents, the response rate for the survey was 100%.

National estimates for the inmate population on June 30, 1994, were
produced by sex, race/Hispanic origin, and age group and for the average
daily population during the year ending June 30, 1994.  National estimates
were also produced for rated capacity.

Sampling error

Survey estimates have an associated sampling error because jurisdictions
with smaller average daily populations were sampled for the survey. 
Estimates based on the sample survey may differ somewhat from the
results of conducting a complete census.  Different samples could yield
somewhat different results.  Standard error is a measure of the variation
among the estimates from all possible samples, stating the precision with
which an estimate from a particular sample approximates the average of
all possible samples.  The estimated relative sampling error for the total
inmate population of 490,442 on June 30, 1994, was 0.50%. (See
appendix tables 1 and 2.)

Results presented in this Bulletin were tested to determine whether
differences between 1993 census counts and 1994 survey estimates were
statistically significant.  All differences mentioned in the report meet or
exceed the 95-percent confidence level.

Measures of population

Two measures of inmate population are used: the average daily population
for the year ending June 30 and the inmate count on June 30 of each year. 
The average daily population balances out any extraordinary events that
may render atypical the inmate count on June 30.  The June 30 count
provides data on characteristics of inmates, such as race, Hispanic origin,
and age, that may not be available on an annual basis.

Juveniles

State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be incarcerated in
adult jails under a variety of circumstances.  Because of the differing
statutes and practices, however, accurate and comparable data on juveniles
are difficult to collect.  The 1994 Annual Survey of Jails provides new
and more accurate estimates of the juvenile population.  For the first time,
the survey provides estimates of the total number of jail inmates under age
18, the number held as adults, and the number held as juveniles.  New
sampling procedures were also introduced in 1994 to minimize the
standard errors of these estimates.  By stratifying jurisdictions based on
the authority to house juveniles, the precision of the juvenile counts were
improved.
