As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, 
the 108th Congress merged the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant
Program (Byrne) with the Local Law Enforcement Block
Grant Program (LLEBG) to establish the Edward Byrne
Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG). The
Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) administers the JAG
program, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)
calculates the JAG formulas.

The total funds made available for FY 2005 JAG awards
was $495.5 million.  The program has six purpose areas
under which funds may be awarded:

*  Law enforcement programs
*  Prosecution and court programs
*  Prevention and education programs
*  Corrections and community corrections programs
*  Drug treatment programs
*  Planning, evaluation, and technology improvement 
programs

JAG funds can be used to pay for personnel, overtime, and
equipment.

This BJS Technical Report describes the steps in the JAG
formula calculation process and presents summary results
of the FY 2005 formula calculations.   

Formula calculation process

There are six steps in the JAG formula calculation process:


Step 1: Initial allocation to States and territories

In the first step, initial allocations to States and 
territories are calculated. Half of the available funds are 
allocated based on the State's or Territory's share of 
violent crime, and half of the funds are allocated based on 
the State's or Territory's share of population. Violent crime 
is computed as a 3-year average using figures published in 
the FBI's annual Crime in the United States. Population 
figures are from the Census Bureau. 

For the FY 2005 JAG calculations, crime data were for
2000-02, and population data were for 2002.

Examples:

*  California accounts for 14.6% of total violent crime and
12.0% of total population. California's initial allocation 
is 14.6% of 50% of $495.5 million plus 12.0% of 50% of
$495.5 million, or about $66 million.

*  Vermont accounts for 0.05% of total violent crime and
0.21% of total population. Vermont's initial allocation is
0.05% of 50% of $495.5 million plus 0.21% of 50% of 495.5
million, or about $637,000. 
 
Step 2: De minimus awards

All States and territories receive a de minimus award equal
to 0.25% of the total JAG allocation ($1,238,750 each, or
$69,370,000 total, for FY 2005).  If a State's or Territory's
initial allocation based on crime and population (from Step
1) is less than the de minimus, the State or territory
receives the de minimus as their total JAG allocation.

Examples:

*  California's initial allocation of $66 million exceeds the 
de minimus value, so California will receive the de minimus
plus an award based on their share of total violent crime
and population.

*  Vermont's initial allocation of $637,000 is less than the
de minimus value, so Vermont's total JAG allocation will be
$1,238,750.  

Step 3: Recalculation of crime and population based
awards

The crime and population data for States and territories
receiving only the de minimus award (from Step 2) are
removed from the pool, and remaining JAG funds (less the
de minimus awards) are reallocated based on violent crime
and population.  The resulting award is then added to the
de minimus.

Examples:

*  Vermont received only the de minimus award, so Vermont's 
crime and population data are removed from the pool.

*  After removing the de minimus States, California accounts 
for 14.7% of total violent crime and 12.1% of population. 
Their new JAG allocation is equal to 14.7% of 50% of 
$426.13 million plus 12.1% of 50% of $426.13 million, plus 
the de minimus award, or about $58.3 million. 

Step 4: 60/40 split to State and local governments 

Except for the Territories and the District of Columbia, 
60% of the total allocation to a State is retained by 
State government, and 40% is set-aside for local 
governments.

Examples:

*  California State government retains 60% of $58.3 million,
or about $35 million. The remaining 40%, or $23.3 million,
is set aside for distribution to local governments in
California.

*  Vermont State government retains 60% of the de minimus, 
or $743,250.  The remaining 40%, or $495,500, is set aside 
for distribution to local governments in Vermont.

Step 5: Calculation of State "dollars per crime" and
"threshold"

Awards to local governments are based on their share of
the average of violent crimes the State reported to the 
FBI over 3 years. The minimum local award amount under 
the JAG program is $10,000. To determine whether a local
government is eligible for a JAG award, it is necessary to
calculate the amount of crime for a minimum award in that
State.  

Dividing the total local set-aside for a State by the 3-year
average of violent crimes reported within the State results
in the number of dollars available for each violent crime.
Dividing the minimum $10,000 award amount by the number of 
dollars available per crime results in the threshold amount 
of crime necessary in order to be eligible for a JAG award.

Examples:

*  California has $23.3 million set-aside for local
governments. The sum of 3-year average violent crimes
reported by jurisdictions in California is 210,215 crimes.
Dividing the set-aside by total crime results in the number
of dollars available for each crime: $23.3 million/210,215
crimes = $111 per crime. Therefore, a local California
jurisdiction needs a 3-year average of at least 90 violent
crimes ($10,000/$111) to be eligible for a JAG award.

*  Vermont has $495,500 set-aside for local governments.
The sum of 3-year average violent crimes reported is 640
crimes. Dollars per crime in Vermont equal $495,500/640
crimes or $774 per crime. The threshold is 13 violent
crimes ($10,000/$774) to be eligible for a JAG award.

Step 6: Determination of local governments eligible for 
JAG awards

The JAG legislation specifies that allocations to local
governments are based on their share of the total violent
crime reported by like units of government within the 
State. However, the ‘Transitional Rule' at § 505(d)(2)(B) 
specifies that allocations to units of local government 
for FY 2005 through FY 2007 will follow the LLEBG formula.

Within each State, local governments meeting the threshold 
for the minimum JAG award are eligible for an award based 
on the local government's share of the State total 3-year 
average violent crimes reported to the FBI. 

Examples:

*  Oakland, California, has a 3-year average of 5,343
violent crimes, or 2.5% of all violent crimes reported by
jurisdictions in California. Oakland exceeds the State
threshold of 90 violent crimes. They are eligible for 
2.5% of the $23.3 million set-aside for local governments 
in California, or about $590,000.  

*  The City of Morristown, Vermont, has a 3-year average
of five violent crimes.  They do not meet the State
threshold of 13 violent crimes, so they are ineligible 
for a JAG award.  Their crime -- less than 1% of all 
violent crime in Vermont -- accounts for about $4,000 of 
award funds. These funds are transferred to the State for 
redistribution. 

Results of the FY 2005 JAG formula

In FY 2005, $288.9 million of the $495.5 million available
was allocated to the 50 States. In addition, the District of
Columbia was eligible for $3.0 million, and Puerto Rico was
eligible for $5.9 million. American Samoa, Guam, the
Northern Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands were each
eligible for $1.2 million. 

In FY 2005 $192.6 million was allotted to local governments. 
A total of 2,190 local governments met the threshold number 
of crimes necessary to receive a JAG award and were eligible 
for $163.7 million. The balance of unawarded local allocated 
funds ($28.9 million) have been returned to the States for 
redistribution to State police and local governments. 

Additional JAG provisions

Passthrough requirement

States may only retain award amounts that bear the same
ratio of "total expenditures on criminal justice by the 
State government in the most recently completed fiscal 
year to ... the total expenditure on criminal justice by 
the State government and units of local government within 
the State in such year."

Disparate jurisdictions

In some cases, a disparity may exist between funding
eligibility of a county and associated municipalities. A
potential disparity exists when a unit of local government
(such as a county) bears more than 50% of the costs of
prosecution or incarceration that arise in association with
violent crimes reported by a constituent unit of local
government (such as a municipality), and funds eligible
to any one constituent unit of local government exceeds
150% of the amount eligible to the larger unit of local
government, or 400% for multiple units of government.
  
To qualify for payment, the unit of local government,
together with any such specified geographically contiguous
local government, must submit a joint application to the
Attorney General for the aggregate of funds allocated to
the units of local government.  

Provisions not yet implemented

The ‘Transitional Rule' found at § 505(d)(2)(B) specifies
that allocations to units of local government for FY 2005
through FY 2007 will follow the LLEBG formula. In the
absence of congressional action, the following provisions
will take effect for FY 2008 and subsequent JAG
calculations.

Non-reporting jurisdictions

Local governments that have not reported at least 3 years
of Part I crime data to the FBI within the immediately
preceding 10 years will be ineligible for JAG funding.

Local allocations based on crime 
in like units of government

The allocation of JAG funds to local governments will be
based on the local government's share of 3-year average
violent crimes reported by like units of government (for
example, other cities, townships, and counties) within the
State.

Maximum allocation to local units of government

Units of local government may not receive a JAG award that 
"exceeds such units total expenditures on criminal justice 
services for the most recently completed fiscal year for 
which data are available." Award amounts in excess of
total expenditures "shall be allocated proportionately
among units of local government whose allocations ... do
not exceed their total expenditures on such services."

Methodology

The data used to calculate the allocation amounts are
provided by the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)
program and the Governments Division at the Census
Bureau. The most recent State-level violent crime data are
obtained from the FBI's Crime in the United States (CIUS)
on an annual basis. Data for local jurisdictions are 
obtained in an electronic format directly from the FBI. 
For FY 2005, data through 2002 were used.

The sum of the UCR violent crimes for all local governments 
within a State will not equal the amount reported by that 
State in the FBI's annual publication. BJS uses the 
published UCR State figures, which represent official FBI 
estimates of crime in a State. The FBI imputes crime data 
to adjust for nonreporting local agencies. These imputed 
values attributed to nonreporting local jurisdictions do 
not appear on the electronic datafile provided to BJS
and are not used in the formula calculation.
