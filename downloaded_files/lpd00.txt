---------------------------------
Highlights

Personnel

*  As of June 2000, local police departments had
565,915 full-time employees, including about
441,000 sworn personnel.  Local police employment
was up an average of about 2% per year since 1990. 
 

*  Racial and ethnic minorities comprised 22.7% of
full-time sworn personnel in 2000, up from 17.0% in
1990.  Females comprised 10.6% of officers in 2000,

local police officers increased by 13,300, or 35%; 
Hispanic officers by 17,600, or 93%; and female 
officers by 17,300, or 59%.  

*  Nearly all officers worked for a department using
criminal record checks (99%), background investigations 
(98%), driving record checks (98%), personal interviews 
(97%) and medical exams (96%)to screen applicants. 
Drug tests (88%) and psychological evaluations (88%) 
were also widely used.     

*  In 2000, 15% of departments, employing 32% of
all officers, required new recruits to have completed
at least some college, up from 6% of departments,
employing 10% of officers, in 1990.

*  State-mandated field and academy training
requirements for new officers  averaged about 750
hours combined.  Additional training beyond state
requirements averaged about 300 hours. 

Budget and pay

*  Departments had total operating budgets of $36.7
billion during fiscal 2000, 33% more than in 1990
after adjusting for inflation.  Operating expenditures
in 2000 averaged $80,600 per sworn officer, and
$179 per resident.

*  In 2000 starting salaries for local police officers
ranged from an average of about $21,000 in the smallest 
jurisdictions to about $34,000 in the largest. About 
3 in 4 officers worked for a department that authorized 
collective bargaining. 

Operations

*   All departments used automobiles for routine
patrol.  In addition, 62% of departments, including
86% of those serving 250,000 or more residents,
used foot patrol routinely.  An estimated 43%,
including 94% of those serving 100,000 or more
residents, used bicycle patrol on a regular basis.

*  In 2000, 89% of local police departments,
employing 98% of all officers, participated in a 
9-1-1 emergency system compared to 48% and 78% in
1990.  In 2000, 71% of departments, employing 89%
of all officers, had enhanced 9-1-1, compared to
18% and 49% in 1990.

*  Fifteen percent of departments had officers
assigned full time to a special unit for drug
enforcement, with 13,600 officers so assigned
nationwide.  About a fifth of departments had officers
assigned to a multi-agency drug task force, with a
total of 5,800 officers assigned full time nationwide.

*  Thirty-seven percent of departments, employing
79% of all officers, had drug asset forfeiture receipts
during 1999.  Collectively, departments received an
estimated $320 million in receipts, or $872 per sworn
officer employed.

*  Thirty percent of local police departments were
responsible for providing court security, 21% for
serving civil process, and 14% for operating a jail.

Community policing

*  Sixty-eight percent of local police departments,

policing plan of some type.  Eighteen percent of 
departments, employing 50% of officers, had a
formal, written plan.  

*  Two-thirds of all departments, employing 86% of
all officers, used full-time community policing
officers in 2000.  Collectively, there were about
103,000 local police officers so designated.

*  More than two-thirds of the departments serving a
population of 25,000 or more, and more than four-
fifths of those serving a population of 250,000 
or more, trained all new officer recruits in 
community policing.  

*  More than 9 in 10 departments serving a
population of 10,000 or more regularly met with
community groups during 2000.  Nearly 7 in 10
departments serving 50,000 or more residents
conducted a citizen police academy.

*  About a third of all departments, including about
two-thirds of those serving 50,000 or more residents,
upgraded technology in 2000 to support community
policing efforts. 

*  Forty-four percent of departments, employing
74% of all officers, used full-time school resource
officers in 2000. Collectively, these agencies
employed about 14,000 such officers.
 
Equipment

*  Ninety-eight percent of local police departments,
employing 99% of all officers, authorized the use
of semiautomatic sidearms in 2000.  These were
increases from 73% and 91% in 1990. 

*  An estimated 91% of departments, employing
93% of all officers, authorized use of chemical
agents such as pepper spray during 2000, up from
51% and 72% in 1990.

*  In 2000, 56% of departments, employing 57% of

protective body armor, compared to 24% and 25% in
1990.

*  Nationwide, local police departments in 2000
operated an estimated 231,000 cars, or about 1 car
for every 2 officers employed.  About a third of 
these cars were unmarked. 

*  About 1 in 4 departments used dogs for law
enforcement work, including more than 90% of those
serving a population of 100,000 or more.  Just 2% 
of departments used horses; however, a majority of
those serving 250,000 or more residents did so.

*  Forty-five percent of all local police departments
regularly used video cameras in 2000.  Thirty-seven
percent used them in patrol cars.  Seven percent of
departments used video cameras for traffic
enforcement. 

Computers and information systems

*  From 1990 to 2000, the percentage of local police
departments using in-field computers increased from
5% to 40%.  Departments using in-field computers
employed 75% of all officers in 2000, up from 30% in
1990.

*  The percentage of local police departments using
computers for Internet access rose from 24% in
1997 to 56% in 2000.  During 2000, about 9 in 10
departments serving 50,000 or more residents had
this capability.

*  From 1997 to 2000, the percentage of officers
employed by a department with in-field computer
access to vehicle records increased from 56% to
69%, driving records from 51% to 58%, calls for
service histories from 23% to 37%, and criminal
histories from 25% to 29%.

*  In 2000, 75% of departments used paper reports
as the primary means to transmit criminal incident
field data to a central information system, down from
86% in 1997.  During the same time period, use of
computer and data devices increased from 9% to
19%.

Written policy directives

*  Nearly all departments (93%) had a written
policy on pursuit driving.  Three-fifths restricted
vehicle pursuits according to specific criteria such
as speed or offense.  About a fourth had a policy
that left the decision to the officer’s discretion. 
Seven percent discouraged all vehicle pursuits.

*  Ninety-three percent of local police departments,
employing 99% of all officers, had a written policy on
the use of deadly force.  Eighty-seven percent,
employing 95% of all officers, had a policy on the
use of nonlethal force. 

*  About 9 in 10 departments, employing 97% of

*  About 8 in 10 departments, employing 93% of
officers, had a special policy regarding arrest for
violations of protection orders.  Sixty-three percent
had a mandatory arrest policy, and 18% had a
pro-arrest policy.

The LEMAS survey

During 2000, the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS), as a part of its Law Enforcement
Management and Administrative Statistics
(LEMAS) program, surveyed a nationally
representative sample of State and local law
enforcement agencies operating nationwide. 
Previous LEMAS surveys were conducted in 1987,
1990, 1993, 1997, and 1999.

This report presents data from the 2000 survey
describing the nearly 13,000 local police
departments operating in the United States in
terms of their personnel, expenditures and pay,
operations, community policing initiatives,
equipment, computers and information systems,
and written policies.  Comparisons are made with
prior years where appropriate.

Nearly all local police departments are operated by
municipal (85%) or township (13%) governments.
As of 2000, a total of 171 local police departments
were operated by tribal governments, and 52 by
county governments.

The 2000 LEMAS survey questionnaire was mailed to 
3,132 State and local law enforcement agencies, 
including all 881 agencies with 100 or more sworn 
officers (see Methodology for a description of the 
sample).  The overall response rate was 97.4%.  Among 
local police departments, 1,975 of 2,019 surveys were 
returned for a 97.8% response rate.  

This report and its companion report (Sheriffs'
Offices 2000, NCJ-196534), summarize data collected 
from agencies of all sizes.  Trend data on the 
police departments serving the 62 largest U.S.
cities were previously published in the BJS Special
Report  (Police Departments in Large Cities: 
1990-2000, NCJ-175703).

Personnel

As of June 30, 2000, local police departments had
565,915 full-time employees.  They also employed
about 62,000 persons on a part-time basis. 
Approximately 441,000, or 78%, of full-time local
police employees were sworn personnel (those
with general arrest powers).

Local police departments employed 62% of all
State and local sworn officers nationwide.  Their
124,995 full-time civilian employees comprised
40% of all nonsworn State and local law
enforcement employees.

There were about 106,000, or 23%, more full-time
local police employees in 2000 than in 1990. 
When only sworn personnel are considered,
employment by local police departments increased
by about 78,000, or 21.5%, from 1990 to 2000.  

Overall, the number of part-time local police
employees increased by about 8,400, or 16%,
from 1990 to 2000.  When only sworn personnel
are considered, part-time employment by local
police departments was up by about 2,800, or
11.4%, from 1990 to 2000.

According to a census of law enforcement agencies 
conducted by BJS during 2000, 582 local police 
departments employed at least 100 sworn personnel 
(4.6%), including 47 with 1,000 or more officers 
(0.4%). A total of 5,894 departments employed fewer 
than 10 sworn personnel (46.5%), including nearly 
700 with just one officer (5.3%). (See Census of 
State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, 2000, NCJ-
194066).
                              
Thirty-four percent of all full-time local police
officers were employed by a department with
1,000 or more sworn personnel, and 61% were
employed by a department with at least 100 sworn
personnel.  Departments that employed fewer than
10 officers accounted for about 5% of officers
nationwide.

Although 74% of all local police departments
served fewer than 10,000 residents, these
agencies employed  just 15% of all officers.  
About half of all officers served a jurisdiction 
with 100,000 or more residents. 
 
Departments serving 1 million or more residents
had an average of 8,334 full-time employees,
including 6,445 sworn personnel. In contrast,
departments serving fewer than 2,500 residents
had an average of 4 full-time employees, including
3 sworn officers.

The vast majority of part-time local police
employees were nonsworn, with an average of
more than 500 such employees in the largest
jurisdictions.  The average number of sworn
part-time employees was no higher than 3 in any
population category.

Among municipal police departments serving a
population of 1,000 or more, the average ratio of
full-time officers per 1,000 residents was 2.6. 
Those serving 25,000 to 249,999 residents had the
lowest average ratio (1.8).

Overall, 68% of full-time local police officers had
regularly assigned duties that included responding
to calls for service.  The proportion of officers
responding to calls ranged from slightly more than
6 in 10 in departments serving 50,000 or more
residents, to about 9 in 10 in those serving fewer
than 10,000 residents.

As of June 30, 2000, local police departments
collectively employed 97% of the maximum
number of full-time sworn personnel authorized by
their budgets.  The lowest actual-to-authorized
ratio for full-time sworn personnel was among
departments serving 250,000 to 499,999 residents
(93%).

Gender and race of officers

Of the 440,920 full-time sworn personnel in local
police departments as of June 2000, an estimated
10.6% were women.  The percentage of female
officers ranged from 16.5% in departments serving
a population of 500,000 or more to about 4% of the
officers in jurisdictions with fewer than 2,500
residents.
 
In 2000, an estimated 22.6% of full-time local
police officers were members of a racial or ethnic
minority.  Minority officers comprised more than a
third of the total in jurisdictions with 500,000 or
more residents.

Blacks or African Americans accounted for 11.7%
of all local police officers in 2000.  Black
employment was highest among departments
serving a population of 500,000 to 999,999
(25.2%).

An estimated 8.3% of local police officers
nationwide were Hispanic or Latino, with the
highest representation among departments
serving a population of 1 million or more (17.3%).

In 2000 the estimated 46,659 female officers
represented an increase of about 17,300, or 59%,
from 1990.  During this time female representation
among local police officers increased from 8.1% to
10.6%.

The number of local police officers who were
members of a racial or ethnic minority in 2000
(99,591) represented an increase of about 38,000,
or 61%, over 1990 levels.  From 1990 to 2000,
minority representation in local police departments
increased from 17.0% to 22.7%.

The estimated 51,363 full-time black or African
American local police officers employed in 2000
represented an increase of about 13,300, or 35%,
compared to 1990.  This resulted in an  increase in
the percentage of officers who were black from
10.5% to 11.7%.

An estimated 36,442 Hispanic or Latino officers
were employed by local police departments in
2000.  This was about 17,600, or 93%, more than
in 1990.  From 1990 to 2000, the percentage of
local police officers who were Hispanic or Latino
rose from 5.2% to 8.3%.  

From 1990 to 2000 representation by other minority 
groups such as Asians, Pacific Islanders, and 
American Indians increased by 150% to about
11,800 officers.  These groups comprised 2.7% of
local police officers in 2000 compared to 1.3% in
1990.

Screening of officer applicants 

Local police departments employed a variety of
screening methods when hiring new officers. 
Nearly all used personal interviews (96%), and a
majority used medical exams (81%), drug tests
(67%), and psychological evaluations (61%).  

Among departments serving 25,000 or more residents, 
about 8 in 10 used physical agility tests and 
written aptitude tests.  More than half the
departments in these population categories used
personality inventories and polygraph exams.

In addition to interviews, tests, and examinations,
nearly all departments screened recruits through
background investigations (96%), criminal record
checks (96%), and driving record checks (93%). 
About half conducted credit record checks (48%). 
 
Nearly all local police officers were employed by
departments that screened recruits with criminal
record checks (99%), background investigations
(98%), driving record checks (98%), personal
interviews (97%), and medical exams (96%). 
About 7 in 8 were employed by departments that
used psychological evaluations (88%) and drug
tests (88%).  About 3 in 4 worked for departments
that used physical agility tests (77%), aptitude
tests (76%), and credit checks (75%).

Education and training requirements

Nearly all (98%) local police departments had an
education requirement for new officer recruits. 
The typical minimum requirement was a high
school diploma (83%).  Fifteen percent of
departments had some type of college requirement, 
usually a 2-year degree (8%).  Just 1% required 
new recruits to have a 4-year college degree.

The percentage of officers employed by a
department with some type of college requirement
for new officers in 2000 (32%) was about 3 times
that of 1990 (10%).  From 1990 to 2000, the
percentage of officers employed by a department
with a degree requirement increased from 3% to
9%.

In 2000 new local police recruits were required to
complete an average of about 1,600 hours of
academy and field training in departments serving
100,000 or more residents, compared to about 800
hours in those serving a population of less than
2,500.  On average, about 70% of these training
hours were State mandated, with the remainder a
departmental requirement.

The average annual in-service training requirement 
for non-probationary officers was 73 hours, including 
26 State-mandated hours.

Overall, just 4% of departments operated a training
academy; however, nearly all of those serving a
population of 250,000 or more did so.  Nationwide,
47% of all officers were employed by a department
that operated an academy.

Budget and pay

Operating budgets

The total operating budget of local police
departments during fiscal 2000 was about $36.7
billion, 78% more than in 1990.  Controlling for
inflation, the net increase in total budget was 33%.
(These figures do not include budgets for capital
expenditures such as equipment purchases or
construction projects.) Local police departments
accounted for 56% of the $65.7 billion in total
operating budgets for State and local law
enforcement agencies during fiscal 2000.  

Nationwide, operating budgets were about $2.9
million per department for fiscal 2000, ranging from
about $553 million for departments serving a
population of 1 million or more, to $195,000
among those serving fewer than 2,500 residents.  

The overall operating cost per resident was $179,
with departments in jurisdictions with a population
of 1 million or more costing the most to operate,
$262 per resident.  Departments serving a
population of 2,500 to 9,999 had the lowest per
resident cost -- $142. 

Nationwide, local police departments cost an
estimated $80,600 per sworn officer to operate for
fiscal 2000, ranging from $96,100 per officer in
jurisdictions with a population of 250,000 to
499,999, to $42,300 per officer in jurisdictions with
a population under 2,500.

When both sworn and nonsworn employees are included, 
the average operating budget for local police 
departments was about $61,400 per employee for the year.  
Operating costs ranged from more than $69,000 per 
employee in jurisdictions with 250,000 to 999,999 
residents to about $35,800 per employee in those with 
fewer than 2,500 residents.

After controlling for inflation, per officer operating
costs for 2000 were $7,100, or 9.7%, higher than
in 1990.  The largest increase, from $73,400 to
$90,500, was recorded in jurisdictions with 50,000
to 249,999 residents.  The smallest increase, from
$46,200 to $53,400, was in jurisdictions with under
10,000 residents.

Salaries

The overall average base starting salary for local
police chiefs was $43,700 in 2000.  Average
starting salaries for chiefs ranged from $104,400 in
jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents to
$30,200 in those with a population under 2,500.

Salaries for first-line supervisors (sergeant or
equivalent) increased with jurisdiction size in a
pattern similar to that for entry-level officers.  
Overall, the average starting salary for sergeants was
$35,100, ranging from $53,700 in the largest
jurisdictions to $26,000 in the smallest.  When size
of department is considered, the average minimum
salary earned by local police sergeants was an
estimated $46,900.

By department, the average base starting salary
offered to entry-level patrol officers in 2000 was
$25,500.  Starting salaries ranged from $20,900 in
jurisdictions with fewer than 2,500 residents to
more than $34,000 in those with a population of
50,000 to 499,999.  When size of department is
factored in, it is estimated that new entry-level
local police officers started at an average salary of
about $31,700 during 2000.  

From 1990 to 2000 average starting salaries
increased 35% for entry-level officers from $18,900
to $25,500.  However, after controlling for inflation,
the increase was 0.8%.  By population category, the
largest increase was in jurisdictions with fewer than
10,000 residents, where salaries rose an average of
30.7% after adjusting for inflation, from $17,791 to
$23,254.  

Smaller increases occurred in jurisdictions with
50,000 to 249,999 residents, from $31,841 to
$34,276 (7.6%); and jurisdictions with 10,000 to
49,999 residents, from $29,568 to $30,624 (3.4%). 
In jurisdictions with 250,000 or more residents,
starting salaries for officers declined 0.8%, from
$34,124 to $33,867.

Special pay

Nationwide, 38% of local police departments,
employing 58% of all officers, offered tuition
reimbursement to officers.  This included a majority
of departments serving 10,000 or more residents.   

An estimated 30% of departments offered education
incentive pay to qualifying officers, including a
majority of those serving a population of 10,000 or
more.  About half (49%) of all local police officers
worked for a department that offered this type of
incentive pay.

Twenty-one percent of local police departments,
employing 30% of all local police officers, offered
merit pay to qualifying sworn personnel.

Nineteen percent of departments offered shift
differential pay to full-time officers.  This included 
a majority of the departments serving a population of
250,000 or more.  Nationwide, 49% of local police
officers were employed by a department with shift
differential pay.

Twelve percent of departments offered special skills
pay, including two-thirds of departments serving a
population of 1 million or more and about two-fifths
of departments serving a population of 50,000 to
999,999.  Overall, 31% of local police officers
worked in a department that offered special skills
pay.

Hazardous duty pay was available in 4% of all local
police departments, employing 22% of all officers. 
About half of the departments serving a population
of 500,000 or more offered this type of pay.

Work-related policies 

Forty-eight percent of local police departments,
employing 69% of all officers, had a written policy
on the maximum number of hours that officers can
work.  About three-fourths of departments serving
a population of 500,000 or more residents
maintained such a policy, compared to about a
third of those serving a population of less than
2,500.

Seventy-eight percent of departments, employing
94% of all officers, had a written policy pertaining
to off-duty employment by officers.  More than
90% of departments serving 10,000 or residents or
more had such a policy. 

Unions and collective bargaining

Nationwide, 40% of all local police departments,
employing 72% of all officers, authorized collective
bargaining for sworn personnel.  At least 65% of
the departments in each population category of
10,000 or more authorized collective bargaining for
officers.  
 
Nonsworn personnel in local police departments
were less likely to have collective bargaining rights
than sworn employees.  Overall, 20% of local
police departments, employing 57% of all
nonsworn local police personnel, authorized
collective bargaining for civilian employees.

The average starting salary for entry-level officers
was about $8,000 higher in departments that
authorized collective bargaining than in those that
did not authorize it.  Departments with collective
bargaining for officers had higher average
entry-level salaries in all population categories.  
In jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000 residents the
difference was about $6,200, 10,000 to 49,999
residents, $6,400; 50,000 to 249,999 residents,
$6,300; and 250,000 or more residents, $1,500.

Patrol and response

In 2000 all local police departments used
automobiles to provide routine patrol services in
their jurisdiction.  In addition, 62% of all
departments used foot patrol units on a routine
basis.  This included 86% of those serving a
population of 250,000 or more.  Departments with
routine foot patrol employed 75% of all officers.

More than 9 in 10 departments serving 100,000 or
more residents had routine bike patrols, as did
about three-fourths of the departments serving
10,000 to 99,999 residents.  Overall, 43% of
departments, employing 83% of all officers, used
bicycle patrol units on a routine basis.  

The percentage of departments using foot and
bicycle patrols has increased since 1997, when
50% of local departments reported using foot
patrols, and 28% reported using bicycle patrols. 
From 1997 to 2000, the percentage of departments 
using one or both of these patrol types increased 
from 60% to 74%.

Overall, just 12% of departments used motorcycle
patrol on a routine basis during 2000.  However,
88% of those serving 100,000 or more residents
did so.  Departments using motorcycle patrols
employed 58% of all officers.  

Few departments routinely scheduled marine (3%)
or horse (2%) patrol units.  However, more than
half of the departments serving 500,000 or more
residents used these types of patrol.

All but a few small local police departments
regularly responded to citizen calls for service. 
Nearly half of all departments dispatched calls as
well.  This included all departments serving a
population of 1 million or more, about 9 in 10
departments serving a population of 250,000 to
999,999, and about 8 in 10 departments serving a
population of 10,000 to 249,999. 

9-1-1 emergency telephone system

In 2000, 89% of local police departments participated 
in an emergency telephone system whereby one of their 
units could be dispatched as a result of a call to 
9-1-1 or its equivalent.  At least 9 in 10 departments 
in each population category of 2,500 or more were 9-1-1 
participants, including all of those serving 250,000 
or more residents.

About 7 in 10 local police departments had enhanced 
9-1-1 systems, capable of automatically displaying 
information such as a caller's phone number, address, 
and special needs.  This included approximately 9 in 
10 departments serving a population of 10,000 or more.  
About three-fifths of departments in jurisdictions with
fewer than 2,500 residents had enhanced 9-1-1.

The 89% participation rate in 9-1-1 during 2000
was a substantial increase from 1990 when 48% of
departments were 9-1-1 participants.  In 2000,
98% of all local police officers worked for
departments with 9-1-1.

The 71% of departments participating in an
enhanced 9-1-1 system in 2000 also represented
a large increase over 1990 when 18% were
participants. In 2000, 90% of local police officers
were employed by a department with enhanced
9-1-1.

Among existing local police 9-1-1 systems, there
were about twice as many with enhanced
capabilities in 2000 (80%) as in 1990 (38%).  The
percent of systems that were enhanced was up
significantly in all population categories (see cover
graph). In jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000
residents, the percent of systems with enhanced
capabilities went from 28% in 1990 to 75% in
2000; 10,000 to 49,999 residents, from 53% to
90%; 50,000 to 249,999 residents, from 63% to
92%; 250,000 or more residents, from 74% to 98%.

Crime investigation

Overall, 93% of local police departments regularly
investigated at least some types of crimes during
the 12-month period ending June 30, 2000. 
Fifty-eight percent handled homicide investigations.  
This included all departments serving 250,000 or more 
residents and more than 9 in 10 departments serving 
a population of 25,000 to 249,999.  

Sixty-one percent of all departments conducted
arson investigations.  This included more than
four-fifths of the departments serving 10,000 to
99,999 residents and more than two-thirds of those
serving 100,000 or more residents.

Drug enforcement activities

About 9 in 10 local police departments regularly
performed drug enforcement functions.  More than
90% of the departments in each population
category of 2,500 or more had drug enforcement
responsibilities, including all of those serving
100,000 or more residents.  Departments with drug
enforcement responsibilities employed 98% of all
local police officers.

Fifteen percent of local police departments
operated a special unit for drug enforcement with
one or more officers assigned full-time.  All
departments serving 1 million or more residents
had a full-time drug enforcement unit, as did the
majority of those serving a population of 50,000 to
999,999, and nearly half of those serving 25,000 to
49,999 residents.  

There were an estimated 13,644 local police
officers assigned full time to drug enforcement
units nationwide.  The average number of officers
assigned ranged from 335 in jurisdictions with 1
million or more residents to 1 in those with fewer
than 10,000 residents.

Drug task force participation

In 2000 an estimated 21% of local police departments 
had one or more officers assigned full time to a 
multi-agency drug enforcement task force.  About two-
thirds of all local police officers worked for a 
department that assigned officers to a task force.  

Nationwide, about 5,800 local police officers were
assigned full time to a drug task force.  The
average number assigned full time ranged from 35
in departments serving a population of 1 million or
more to about 2 in those serving fewer than
100,000 residents.

Drug asset forfeiture receipts

Thirty-seven percent of all local police departments
received money, property, or goods from a drug
asset forfeiture program during 1999.  These
departments employed 79% of all local police
officers.  At least 82% of the departments in each
population category of 25,000 or more had drug
asset forfeiture receipts.

The overall median amount received from drug
asset forfeiture programs by local police
departments during 1999 was $5,000.  By
population category, the median amount received
ranged from about $1.9 million among departments 
serving a population of 1 million or more to $2,000 
among those serving fewer than 2,500 residents.

Local police departments received an estimated
$320 million in money goods, and property during
1999.  Including  both departments with receipts
and those without, this was the equivalent of $703
per sworn officer employed.  Departments with at
least 100 but fewer than 1,000 full-time officers
received the most -- more than $900 per officer. 
Next highest were departments with 50 to 99
officers or 1,000 or more officers with about $800
per officer.  Departments with fewer than 25
officers received the least -- $178 per officer.

Court-related functions

Although 90% of local police departments executed 
arrest warrants, just 30% provided court security 
and 21% served civil process. Departments handling 
court security employed 29% of all officers and those 
serving civil process, 24%.

Detention-related functions

Fourteen percent of local police departments
operated at least one jail during 2000.  No more
than 35% of the departments in any population
category were operating a jail, and just 6% of the
departments in jurisdictions with fewer than 2,500
residents operated one. Twenty-seven percent of
all local police officers worked for a department
with a jail.

Twenty-six percent of departments operated at
least one temporary holding (lockup) facility for
adults that was separate from a jail.  The median
maximum holding time for these facilities was 12
hours.  

The median total capacity of adult lockups ranged
from 100 in jurisdictions with 250,000 to 499,999
residents to 3 in those with fewer than 10,000
residents.  The total adult capacity of local police
lockups nationwide was about 25,500.

Thirteen percent of departments had a lockup
facility for juveniles.  The median capacity of
juvenile lockups ranged from 15 in jurisdictions
with 500,000 to 999,999 residents to 2 in those
with fewer than 50,000 residents. Nationwide local
police lockups for juveniles had a total capacity 
of about 4,600 with a median maximum holding time
of 6 hours.  

Special operations functions

An estimated 30% of local police departments,
employing 53% of all officers, performed search
and rescue operations on a regular basis during
2000.  A majority of departments serving a
population of 250,000 or more performed this
function, compared to about a third of those
serving fewer than 100,000 residents.

Twenty-two percent of departments performed
tactical operations, utilizing what are commonly
known as SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics)
teams.  These departments employed 72% of all
local police officers.  All departments serving a
population of 250,000 or more performed tactical
operations, and a large majority of those serving a
population of 50,000 to 249,999 did so as well.

Community policing

Community policing promotes organizational 
strategies to address the causes and reduce the
fear of crime and social disorder through
problem-solving tactics and community partnerships.  
A fundamental shift from traditional reactive policing, 
community policing stresses the prevention of crime 
before it occurs.  The implementation of a community 
policing plan supports and empowers front-line officers,
decentralizes command, and encourages innovative problem 
solving.

In 2000, 18% of local police  departments, employing 
52% of all local police officers, had a formally 
written community policing plan.  More than three-fifths 
of departments serving 100,000 or more residents had a 
formal plan, as did about half of those serving a 
population of 50,000 to 99,999.  

In all population categories, a majority of departments 
had either a formal, written community policing plan or 
an informal, unwritten plan. Departments serving a 
population of less than 50,000 were more likely to have 
an informal, unwritten plan than a formal, written one.  
Overall, 90% of local police officers worked for a
department with some type of community policing
plan.

Community policing training

During the year ending June 30, 2000, 51% of local 
police departments, employing 84% of all officers, 
trained at least some new recruits in community 
policing skills such as problem-solving; Scanning, 
Analysis, Response, Assessment (SARA); and developing 
community partnerships.  

Thirty-eight percent of departments, employing
75% of all officers, trained all new recruits in
community policing.  The proportion of departments 
that trained all recruits ranged from nearly 8 in 
10 among those serving 50,000 or more residents to 
2 in 10 among those serving fewer than 2,500 residents.

Fifty-nine percent of departments, employing 59%
of officers, trained at least some in-service officers
during the 1-year period.  Twenty-one percent of
departments, employing 25% of all officers, trained
all in-service officers in community policing.

Fifteen percent of departments, employing 32% of
nonsworn local police employees, trained at least
some civilian employees in community policing
during the 1-year period.  This included about half
of the departments serving a population of 50,000
to 249,999.

Community policing personnel

Overall, 66% of departments, employing 86% of all
officers, had full-time sworn personnel serving as
community policing officers.  In some jurisdictions,
these officers may be known as community relations 
officers, community resource officers, or some other 
name indicative of the community policing approach 
they employed.  Nationwide, local police departments 
employed about 103,000 community policing officers or 
their equivalent. 

A majority of departments in all population categories 
had full-time community policing officers.  Those 
serving a population of 1 million or more employed 2,208 
such officers on average. Departments serving fewer than 
2,500 residents had 3 on average.

In all population categories, the percentage of local 
police departments using community policing officers 
was greater in 2000 than in 1997.  In jurisdictions 
with fewer than 10,000 residents, the percentage rose 
from 26% to 62%; in those with 10,000 to 49,999 
residents, from 57% to 75%; in those with 50,000 to 
249,999 residents, from 76% to 93%; and in those with 
250,000 or more residents, from 75% to 92%.

An estimated 44% of local police departments, employing 
74% of all local police officers, had full-time sworn 
personnel assigned as school resource officers during 
2000. A majority of departments serving a population of 
10,000 or more used school resource officers, including
more than 80% of those in jurisdictions with 25,000
to 499,999 residents. 

School resource officers use a community policing
approach to provide a safe environment for students and 
staff.  In addition to handling calls for service within 
the school, they work closely with school administrators 
and staff to prevent crime and disorder by monitoring 
crime trends, problem areas, cultural conflicts, and 
other areas of concern.  

Overall, local police departments had nearly 14,000 full-
time sworn personnel assigned as school resource officers 
as of June 2000.  The average number of school resource 
officers ranged from 85 in departments serving 1 million 
or more residents, to 2 in those serving fewer than
25,000 residents.

Community-oriented policies 
and programs

Forty percent of local police departments, employing 78% 
of local police officers, gave patrol officers 
responsibility for specific geographic areas or beats during 
2000. This included a majority of the departments serving a 
population of 10,000 or more.

Just 9% of departments, employing 46% of all officers, 
assigned cases to investigators by geographic area, although 
a majority of the departments serving a population of 100,000 
or more did so.

Thirty-two percent of departments, employing 56% of all 
officers, actively encouraged patrol officers to become 
involved in problem-solving projects. More than half of 
the departments serving 50,000 or more residents had such 
a policy, as did half of those serving 25,000 to 49,999 
residents.
 
Fourteen percent of departments included problem-
solving projects in the performance evaluation 
criteria for patrol officers.  This included
at least 30% of those in each population category
of 25,000 or more. Departments including problem-solving 
projects in performance evaluation criteria employed 35% 
of all officers.

Thirty-two percent of departments, employing 63% of 
all officers, upgraded technology during 2000 to
support their  community policing efforts.  This
included a majority of departments serving 25,000
or more residents, and half of departments serving
10,000 to 24,999 residents.  

An estimated 18% of departments enhanced their
proactive role in solving community problems by
forming problem-solving partnerships with community 
groups, local agencies, or others through written 
agreements.  This included about half of the 
departments serving a population of 50,000 or more.  
Departments forming partnerships through written 
agreements employed 39% of all officers.

Seventeen percent of departments, employing 51% of 
all officers, offered training to citizens on
community policing topics such as community
mobilization and problem-solving during the
12-month period ending June 30, 2000.  A majority
of departments serving 50,000 or more residents
offered such training.  

Fifteen percent of all departments, employing 57%
of all officers, conducted a citizen police academy
during the year ending June 30, 2000.  A majority
of departments serving a population of 50,000 or
more conducted citizen academies during this
period, while fewer than 1 in 10 departments
serving a population of under 10,000 did so. 

About three-quarters of departments, including
more than 90% of those serving 10,000 or more
residents, met regularly with community groups
during the year ending June 30, 2000.   
Departments holding regular community group
meetings employed 94% of all officers. 

Most departments met with a wide variety of
community groups.  Those that regularly met with
neighborhood associations (77%) and school
groups (76%) employed about three-fourths of all
local police officers.

The corresponding percentages for other types of
groups that departments met with were as follows: 
business groups (68%), senior citizen groups
(59%), domestic violence groups (57%), local
public agencies (57%), advocacy groups (53%),
youth service organizations (52%), religious
groups (48%), and tenants’ associations (47%).

Twenty-six percent of local police departments,
employing 50% of all officers, surveyed citizens in
their jurisdiction during the year ending June 30,
2000.  Eighteen percent of departments, employing 
44% of all officers, surveyed citizens' regarding 
their satisfaction with police services. A majority 
of the departments serving 100,000 to
999,999 conducted this type of survey.

Twelve percent of departments, employing 37% of all 
officers, surveyed citizens regarding their perception 
of crime problems; 11%, employing 26% of all officers, 
surveyed citizens regarding crime reporting; and 7%, 
employing 27% of all officers, surveyed citizens regarding 
their personal crime experiences.

A majority of the departments conducting surveys used 
the data to provide information to officers (65%), or 
to evaluate program effectiveness (54%).  Other common 
uses included prioritizing crime and disorder problems 
(47%), formulating agency policy and procedures (42%), 
training development (39%), and allocation of resources to
neighborhoods (35%).

Equipment

Sidearms

In 2000, 98% of local police departments, employing 
99% of all local police officers, authorized the 
use of some type of semiautomatic sidearm.  This 
represents a significant increase from 1990 when 73% 
of departments, employing 91% of all officers, 
authorized semiautomatics.  

In 2000, 75% of departments authorized the .40-caliber 
semiautomatic.  This represents an increase from 57% 
in 1997, the first year for which comparable data are 
available.  Departments authorizing the .40-caliber in 
2000 employed 60% of all officers  

Sixty-seven percent of departments, employing 75% of all 
officers, authorized the 9mm.  Other semiautomatic sidearms 
authorized included the .45-caliber (54%), the .380-caliber 
(38%), and the 10mm (30%).  Forty-four percent of departments
authorized the use of revolvers by officers.

Sixty percent local police departments, employing
71% of all officers, supplied regular field officers
with their primary sidearm.  Four percent of
departments employing 3% of all officers, provided
a cash allowance.  

Body armor

In 2000, 64% of departments, employing 69% of
all officers, required at least some field officers 
to wear protective body armor while on duty. 
Seventy-seven percent of departments, employing
88% of all officers, supplied armor to officers and
6% provided a cash allowance.

The percentage of departments requiring all regular 
field officers to wear body armor increased from 24% 
in 1990 to 56% in 2000.  Such an increase was seen 
in all population categories: Under 10,000 residents, 
23% to 56%; 10,000 to 49,999, 27% to 59%; 50,000 to 
249,999, 22% to 50%; 250,000 or more from 21% to 45%. 

Nonlethal weapons 

In 2000 nearly all local police departments
authorized officers to use one or more types of
nonlethal weapons.  Chemical agents, such as
pepper spray, were the most commonly
authorized.  Ninety-one percent of departments,
employing 92% of officers, authorized the use of
pepper spray.  

Batons were also commonly authorized, with 88%
of all departments allowing their use.  Departments
authorizing one or more types of batons employed
96% of all officers.  Collapsible batons (73%) were
authorized by nearly twice as many departments
as PR-24 (40%) or traditional (38%) batons.

About four-fifths of local police officers nationwide
worked for a department authorizing collapsible
batons (78%) and about half for one authorizing
traditional (55%) or PR-24 (47%) batons.  

Thirteen percent of departments, employing 44%
of all officers, authorized flash/bang grenades. 
Seven percent of departments, employing 24% of

Seven percent of departments, employing 16% of
all officers, authorized the use of carotid holds,
choke holds, or neck restraints.  Departments
serving 1 million or more (40%) were the most
likely to authorize these types of actions.

From 1990 to 2000, in population categories of
less than 250,000, there were large increases in
the percentage of departments authorizing chemical 
agents.  These increases were as follows:  50,000 
to 249,999, 65% to 97%; 10,000 to 49,999 residents, 
59% to 97%; under 10,000, 48% to 89%.  In departments 
serving 250,000 or more residents, the increase was 
from 86% to 88%. In 2000, 93% of officers were employed 
by a department that authorized chemical agents,
compared to 72% in 1990.

Use of force policies

Ninety-three percent of departments, employing
99% of all officers, had a written policy pertaining
to the use of deadly force.  All departments serving
25,000 or more residents, and nearly all of those
serving 2,500 to 9,999 residents, had such a
policy. 

Eighty-seven percent of departments, employing
95% of all officers, had a written policy pertaining
to the use of nonlethal force.  All departments
serving a population of 1 million or more had this
type of policy, as did more than 9 in 10 departments 
serving a population of 2,500 to 999,999. 

Vehicles

Nationwide, local police departments operated an
estimated 231,363 cars, or about 51 cars per 100
sworn personnel.  By population category, the ratio
of cars to officers was lowest in  jurisdictions 
with 1 million or more residents -- 26 cars per 100
officers. It ranged from 51 to 64 cars per 100
officers in other population categories.

About a third of the cars operated by local police
departments were unmarked (35%).  The percentage 
of cars that were unmarked ranged from 47% in 
jurisdictions with a population of 1 million or 
more to 14% in jurisdictions with fewer than 2,500 
residents.

In addition to cars, 44% of departments used other
4-wheel motorized vehicles such as sport utility
vehicles, trucks or vans.  This included a large
majority of departments in jurisdictions serving
10,000 or more residents.  Overall, there were
about 24,000 such vehicles operated, or about 5
per 100 sworn personnel employed.

About 1 in 8 departments used motorcycles during
2000, including about 9 in 10 departments serving
a population of 100,000 or more.  Nationwide,
local police operated about 9,800 motorcycles, or
about 2 for every 100 officers employed. 

Nearly half of all departments were using bicycles
as of June 2000, with a total of nearly 29,000
nationwide.  The ratio of bicycles to officers was
highest in jurisdictions with a population of 2,500
to 9,999 (11 per 100), with an overall ratio for all
population categories of 6 bicycles per 100 sworn
personnel.

Vehicle-related policies 

Forty-nine percent of local police departments,
employing 39% of local police officers, allowed
officers to take marked vehicles home.  The
percentage of departments allowing officers to
take vehicles home exceeded 60% in jurisdictions
with 250,000 to 999,999 residents, and in those
with a population of less than 2,500.

In a large majority of the departments that allowed
marked vehicles to be taken home, officers were
allowed only to drive the vehicle to and from work. 
Just 10% of departments allowed officers to
operate a marked vehicle for personal errands,
with those serving 100,000 to 999,999 residents
the most likely to have such a policy.

Fifty-seven percent of departments, employing 74% of 
all officers, had a restrictive pursuit driving policy.  
This type of policy restricts vehicle pursuits
according to specific criteria such as type of
offense or maximum speed. 
 
Twenty-seven percent of departments, employing 17% of 
all officers, had a judgmental pursuit policy, one 
that leaves pursuit decisions to the officer's
discretion.  Seven percent of departments, employing 
5% of all officers, discouraged all vehicle pursuits.

Off-land vehicles

Five percent of local police departments, employing 
38% of all officers, operated at least one boat during 
2000.  This included about two-thirds of those serving 
500,000 or more residents.  Nationwide, local police 
operated nearly 1,100 boats.   

One percent of departments, employing 29% of all
officers, used helicopters.  A majority of
departments serving 250,000 or more residents
did so.  There were an estimated 241 local police
helicopters in use nationwide during 2000.

Less than 1% of local police departments operated
any fixed-wing aircraft, with a total of about 50 
in use nationwide.  Nearly half of departments
serving 1 million or more residents operated at
least 1 airplane.  Departments using airplanes
employed 9% of all officers.

Animals

Twenty-six percent of local police departments,
employing 72% of all officers, used dogs for law
enforcement activities.  This included more than
90% of those serving 100,000 or more residents. 
Overall, about 6,900 dogs were maintained by
local police departments in 2000.

About 2% of departments, employing 36% of all
officers, used horses for law enforcement
purposes, including a majority of those serving
250,000 or more residents.  Local police departments 
collectively maintained approximately 1,400 horses.

Video cameras

Forty-five percent of all local police departments
used video cameras on a regular basis during the
year ending June 30, 2000.  Agencies regularly
using video cameras employed 61% of all local
police officers.  The most common use of video
cameras was in patrol cars (37%).  Departments
using video cameras in cars employed 40% of all
officers.  

Thirteen percent of departments, employing 30%
of all officers, used video cameras for fixed-site
surveillance.  Nine percent of departments,
employing 25% of all officers, used video cameras
for mobile surveillance.  Seven percent of
departments, employing 16% of all officers, used
video cameras for traffic enforcement.  

Special technologies

Eleven percent of local police departments,
employing 38% of all officers, use infrared
(thermal) imagers on a regular basis.  Six percent
of departments, employing 26% of all officers,
used image intensifiers.  Laser range finders were
used regularly by 6% of all departments,
employing 15% of all officers.  

Electrical/engine disruption technology was used
regularly by less than 0.5% of all local police
departments, and such departments employed just
3% of all officers.  Five percent of departments,
employing 36% of all officers, used stolen vehicle
tracking technology on a regular basis.  Tire
deflation spikes were used regularly by 26% of all
departments, employing 36% of all officers.  

Twenty-nine percent of departments, employing
65% of all officers, regularly used digital imaging
technology for mugshots.  Sixteen percent of
departments, employing 47% of all officers, used
digital imaging technology for suspect composites. 
Eleven percent of departments, employing 49% of
all officers, regularly used digital imaging
technology for fingerprints.

Computers and information systems 

Computer functions

Local police departments utilized computers for a
wide variety of  functions in 2000.  For example,
60% of all departments, employing 85% of all
officers, used computers for records management. 

During 2000, 56% of all departments used computers 
for Internet access, including more than 80% of 
those serving a population of 25,000 or more. 
Departments using computers for Internet access 
employed 83% of all officers in 2000. 

More than twice as many local police departments
used computers for Internet access in 2000 (56%)
as in 1997 (24%).  Among departments serving
fewer than 10,000 residents, nearly 3 times as
many were using computers for this purpose in
2000 (48%) as in 1997 (17%).  The increases in
other population categories were as follows: 
10,000 to 49,999 residents, from 45% to 74%;
50,000 to 249,999 residents, from 68% to 89%;
250,000 or more residents, from 79% to 97%.

In 2000, 44% of departments used computers for
crime investigations.  Those using computers for
crime investigations employed 76% of all officers. 
Forty percent of departments, employing 70% of
all officers, used computers to maintain personnel
records.  

About a third of local police departments used
computers for dispatching calls for service (32%). 
A majority of departments serving a population of
10,000 or more had computer-aided dispatch, and
78% of all local police officers worked for such
departments.

Thirty percent of departments, employing 72% of
all officers, used computers for crime analysis.  
Related to crime analysis efforts in local police
departments is the use of crime mapping.  In 2000,
15% of departments, including a large majority of
those serving 100,000 or more residents used
computers in conjunction with crime mapping. 
Departments using computers for crime mapping
purposes employed 59% of all officers in 2000.

Twenty-eight percent of local departments,
employing 46% of all officers, used computers for
interagency information sharing.  

Less than a fifth of local police departments used
computers for automated booking (18%), fleet
management (16%), or resource allocation (10%).

Computerized files

In 2000 a majority of local police departments were
maintaining computerized files on incident reports
(71%), arrests (71%), traffic citations (61%), calls
for service (60%), traffic accidents (58%), and
stolen property (57%).  All of these types of
information were maintained in a computerized
format by a majority of the departments in each
population category of 2,500 or more.

Less than half of all departments maintained
computerized files on warrants (43%), alarms
(42%), traffic stops (36%), criminal histories 
(33%), summonses (25%), use of force incidents 
(21%), linked files for crime analysis (14%), and
fingerprints (7%).  However, a majority of the
departments in each population category of 10,000
or more had computerized files on warrants,
alarms, traffic stops, and criminal histories.

Except for use of force incidents (49%), fingerprints 
(44%), traffic stops (41%), and summonses (30%), a 
majority of local police officers worked for a 
department that had computer files on each type of 
information included in the 2000 LEMAS survey 

Five percent of all local police departments had
exclusive or shared ownership of an Automatic
Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) that
included a file of digitized prints.  These
departments employed 41% of all officers.  A
majority of the departments serving a population 
of 250,000 or more had exclusive or shared
ownership of an AFIS.  Just 2% of those
departments serving fewer than 10,000 resident
had exclusive or shared ownership of an AFIS.

Fifteen percent of local police departments used
an AFIS terminal with access to a remote system. 
These departments employed 22% of all officers.

Use of computers in the field

A majority of local police departments serving
10,000 or more residents used mobile computers
or terminals in the field during 2000, including
more than 80% of those serving 50,000 or more
residents.  Overall 40% of departments, employing 
75% of all officers, were using in-field computers 
or terminals.  

Twenty-seven percent of departments, employing
63% of all officers, used vehicle-mounted
computers in 2000.  This included a majority of
those serving 25,000 or more residents.  

Roughly two-thirds of departments serving a
population of 500,000 or more were using
vehicle-mounted digital/data terminals.  Overall,
about 1 in 8 departments, employing 40% of all
officers, used them.

Thirteen percent of departments, employing 18%
of all officers, used vehicle-mounted laptops 
during 2000. Eight percent used vehicle-mounted
digital/data computers.

Twenty-three percent of departments employing
39% of all officers, used portable (not
vehicle-mounted) computers in 2000.  This
included  nearly half of all departments serving
25,000 or more residents.  

Portable laptops were the most common type of
in-field computer, used by 21% of all departments. 
These departments employed a third of all officers. 
Less common were portable digital/data terminals
(2%) and portable digital/data computers (1%).

The 40% of local police departments using in-field
computers or terminals in 2000 was 8 times the
percentage in 1990 (5%).  Likewise, the 75% of
local police officers working for a department 
with in-field computers or terminals in 2000 was
considerably more than that in 1990 (30%).  

From 1990 to 2000, increases in local police use of
in-field computers and terminals occurred in
jurisdictions of all sizes.  During this period, 
in-field computer use among departments serving
250,000 or more residents increased from 56% to
89%; among departments serving 50,000 to 249,999 
residents, from 31% to 81%; among departments serving 
10,000 to 49,999 residents, from 9% to 62%; and among 
departments serving fewer than 10,000 residents, from 
2% to 30%.

Twenty-three percent of local police departments
used in-field computers or terminals for writing 
field reports.  These departments employed 27% of 
all officers.  Nineteen percent of departments used
them for at least some in-field communications.
These departments employed 42% of all officers. 

In about a quarter of local police departments, at
least some officers in the field could use
computers to access vehicle or driving records
during 2000.  This included a majority of the
departments serving a population of 25,000 or
more residents.  Departments using in-field
computers for these purposes employed more
than half of all officers. 

In 16% of local police departments, employing
29% of all officers, in-field computers or 
terminals could be used to access criminal history
information.  This included about half of the
departments serving a population of 1 million or
more, and about a third of those serving a
population of 50,000 to 999,999.

In 18% of departments, employing 37% of all
officers, in-field computers or terminals could be
used to access calls for service information.  This
included more than half of departments serving a
population of 100,000 or more, and about
two-fifths of those serving a population of 25,000
to 99,999.  

In 6% of all departments, employing 8% of all officers, 
in-field officers had access to linked files for crime 
analysis.  This included about 1 in 6 departments 
serving 500,000 to 999,999 residents, and about 1 in 10 
departments serving 25,000 to 249,999 residents.

From 1997 to 2000, the percentage of local police
officers employed by a department providing at
least some officers with access to information via
in-field computers increased for each type of
information included in the LEMAS survey.  For
motor vehicle records, the increase was from 56%
to 67%; driving records, 51% to 58%; calls for
service, 23% to 37%, criminal history records, 25%
to 29%; linked files for crime analysis, 3% to 8%.

In 2000, 75% of local police departments used
paper reports as the primary method to transmit
criminal incident reports from the field to the
agency's central information system.  Other
methods included computers and data devices
(19%), as well as telephones and wireless
systems (6%).

From 1997 to 2000, use of paper reports to
transmit criminal incident reports declined from
86% to 75%.  During the same period, use of
computer and data devices increased from 9% to
19%, and use of telephone and wireless methods
increased from 4% to 6%.  

By jurisdiction size, the use of paper reports
declined in all population categories:  250,000 or
more residents, 88% to 77%; 50,000 to 249,999,
85% to 79%; 10,000 to 49,999, 80% to 68%; under
10,000, 88% to 77%.

Special arrest policies 

Local police departments often have special
policies to guide officers'  decision-making in
specific situations.  Two examples of this covered
in the 2000 LEMAS survey are the handling of
domestic assaults and the enforcement of
protection orders.

Ninety-one percent of departments, employing
97% of all officers, reported they had a special
policy regarding arrest for domestic assault. 
Seventy-two percent of departments, employing
80% of all officers, had a mandatory arrest policy
for domestic assault.  Seventeen percent of
departments, employing 16% of officers, had a
pro-arrest policy for domestic assault.

Eighty-two percent of departments had a special
policy regarding arrest for violations of protective
orders.  These agencies employed 93% of all local
police officers.  Sixty-three percent of departments,
employing 75% of all officers, had a mandatory
arrest policy and 18%, employing 15% of officers,
had a pro-arrest policy.

Methodology

The Law Enforcement Management and Administrative 
Statistics (LEMAS) survey collects data from a 
nationally representative sample of publicly funded 
State and local law enforcement agencies in the 
United States.  

This report presents data from the 2000 survey
describing local police departments in terms of
their personnel, expenditures and pay, operations,
community policing initiatives, equipment,
computers and information systems, and written
policies.  

The 2000 LEMAS survey questionnaire was mailed to 
3,132 State and local law enforcement agencies.  
Sixty-seven agencies were determined to be out-of-
scope for the survey because they had closed, 
outsourced their operations, or were operating on 
a part-time basis.  The initial mailing of the 
questionnaire was conducted in July 2000. The pay 
period containing June 30, 2000, was used as the 
reference date for all questions, unless otherwise 
noted.
  
Allowing for the exclusion of special jurisdiction
agencies and Texas constables, 881 law enforcement 
agencies in the U.S. with 100 or more sworn officers 
as of June 30, 1996 were included in the sample as 
self-representing (SR) agencies. This included 528 
local police departments, 304 sheriffs' offices, and 
the 49 primary State law enforcement agencies.  

The self-representing (SR) agencies were
supplemented by a nationally representative
sample of agencies with fewer than 100 sworn
personnel.  These nonself-representing (NSR)
agencies were chosen using a stratified random
sample with cells based on the type of agency
(local police or sheriff), size of population 
served, and number of sworn personnel.  The 2,184 
NSR agencies selected included 1,491 local police
departments and 693 sheriffs’ offices.

A total of 2,985 agencies responded to the LEMAS
questionnaire for a response rate of 97.4%.  This
included 866 SR agencies and 2,119 NSR agencies.  
The final database includes responses from 1,975 
local police departments, 961 sheriffs' offices, 
and the 49 primary State police departments.  Among 
local police departments, 1,975 of 2,019 surveys were 
returned for a 97.8% response rate.

The base weight for all SR agencies is 1.  For NSR
sheriffs’ offices, it is 4.  For NSR local police
departments, the base weights are determined by
number of sworn personnel employed as reported
in the 1996 BJS Census of State and Local Law
Enforcement Agencies.  For agencies with 0 to 6
sworn officers, the base weight is 15.55; for 7 to 
13 officers, it is 9.65; for 14 to 23 officers, it 
is 7.09; for 24 to 39 officers, it is 4.95; for 40 to 
62 officers, it is 3.38; and for 63 to 99 officers, 
the base weight is 2.14.

The final weight associated with every agency,
both SR and NSR, is the product of the base
weight, a factor that adjusted for changes in the
universe since 1996, and a factor that adjusted for
any nonresponding agencies in each cell.  

Some responding agencies did not fully complete
the LEMAS questionnaire.  When an agency did
not supply a response to an item, hot deck
imputation, median value imputation or ratio
imputation was used.  Hot deck imputation uses
the value reported by a randomly selected agency
from the same sample cell.  Median value
imputation uses the median value of an item
reported by agencies in the same sample cell. 
Ratio imputation uses the median value of a ratio
reported by agencies in the same sample cell.

Because the data from agencies with fewer than 100
sworn personnel were collected from a sample, the
results are subject to sampling error.  Statements of
comparison in this report reflect  observed
differences between values that are significant at 2
standard errors (the 95-percent confidence level) or
higher.  The survey data are also subject to
response and processing errors.
