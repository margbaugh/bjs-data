Highlights
***********

Prevalence of sexual victimization
-----------------------------------

* An estimated 9.5% of adjudicated youth in state juvenile 
facilities and state contract facilities (representing 1,720 youth 
nationwide) reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual 
victimization by another youth or staff in the past 12 months or 
since admission, if less than 12 months.

* About 2.5% of youth (450 nationwide) reported an incident 
involving another youth, and 7.7% (1,390) reported an incident 
involving facility staff.

* An estimated 3.5% of youth reported having sex or other sexual 
contact with facility staff as a result of force or other forms of 
coercion, while 4.7% of youth reported sexual contact with staff 
without any force, threat, or explicit form of coercion.

* Among state juvenile facilities, the rate of sexual 
victimization declined from 12.6% in 2008-09 (when the first 
survey was conducted) to 9.9% in 2012. The decline in state 
facilities was linked to staff sexual misconduct with force 
(declining from 4.5% of youth in 2008-09 to 3.6% in 2012) and 
staff sexual misconduct without force (declining from 6.7% to 
5.1%).

Facility rankings
-------------------

* Thirteen facilities were identified as high-rate based on the 
prevalence of sexual victimization by youth or staff. Rates in 
each of these facilities had a 95%-confidence interval with a 
lower bound that was at least 35% higher than the average rate of 
sexual victimization among facilities nationwide.

* Two of the high-rate facilities--Paulding Regional Detention 
Center (Georgia) and Circleville Juvenile Correctional Facility 
(Ohio)--had sexual victimization rates of 30% or greater.

* Twenty-six facilities had no reported incidents of sexual 
victimization, and 14 were identified as low-rate after taking 
into account potential statistical variation. The upper bound of 
the 95%-confidence interval in these 14 facilities was less than 
half the average rate among all facilities listed in the survey.

* Youth held in state-owned or -operated facilities reported 
higher rates of staff sexual misconduct (8.2%) than those held in 
locally or privately operated facilities (4.5%).

State-level rates
------------------

* For the first time, state-level estimates were added to the 
survey to provide feedback to state administrators, especially 
those who operate facilities too small to provide facility-level 
estimates.

* Three states (Delaware, Massachusetts, and New York) and the 
District of Columbia had no reported incidents of sexual 
victimization.

* Four states (Georgia, Illinois, Ohio, and South Carolina) had 
high rates, based on the lower bound of the 95%-confidence 
interval of at least 35% higher than the national average. Each 
of these states had an overall sexual victimization rate 
exceeding 15%, which was primarily due to high rates of staff 
sexual misconduct.

Demographic and other youth characteristics
--------------------------------------------

* Rates of reported sexual victimization varied among youth:
8.2% of males and 2.8% of females reported sexual activity 
with staff.

* 5.4% of females and 2.2% of males reported forced sexual 
activity with another youth at a facility.

* White youth reported sexual victimization by another youth 
(4.0%) more often than black youth (1.4%) or Hispanic youth 
(2.1%).

* Black youth reported a higher rate of sexual victimization 
by  facility staff (9.6%) than white youth (6.4%) or Hispanic 
youth (6.4%).

* Youth who identified their sexual orientation as gay, lesbian, 
bisexual, or other reported a substantially higher rate of youth-
on-youth victimization (10.3%) than heterosexual youth (1.5%).

Circumstances surrounding the incident
---------------------------------------

* About 67.7% of youth victimized by another youth reported 
experiencing physical force or threat of force, 25.2% were offered 
favors or protection, and 18.1% were given drugs or alcohol to 
engage in sexual contact.

* Most youth-on-youth victims reported more than one incident 
(69.6%). An estimated 37.2% reported more than one perpetrator.

* Most youth victimized by another youth reported no physical 
injury (82.1%).

* Among the estimated 1,390 youth who reported victimization by 
staff, 89.1% were males reporting sexual activity with female 
staff and 3.0% were males reporting sexual activity with both male 
and female staff. In comparison, males comprised 91% of 
adjudicated youth in the survey and female staff accounted for 44% 
of staff in the sampled facilities.

* Most victims of staff sexual misconduct reported more than one 
incident (85.9%). Among these youth, nearly 1 in 5 (20.4%) 
reported 11 or more incidents.

* About 1 in 5 (20.3%) victims of staff sexual misconduct reported 
experiencing physical force or threat of force, 12.3% were offered 
protection, and 21.5% were given drugs or alcohol to engage in 
sexual contact.

* When youth were asked who initiated sexual contact, 36.4% 
reported that the facility staff always made the first move, 17.4% 
reported that they always made the first move, and 46.3% said that 
sometimes the facility staff made the first move and sometimes 
they did.

Sexual Victimization in Juvenile Facilities Reported 
by Youth, 2012
********************************************************

----------------------------------------
National Survey of Youth in Custody-2
----------------------------------------

Between February 2012 and September 2012, the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics completed the second National Survey of Youth in 
Custody (NSYC-2) in 273 state-owned or -operated juvenile 
facilities and 53 locally or privately operated facilities that 
held adjudicated youth under state contract. The survey was 
conducted by Westat (Rockville, MD), under a cooperative agreement 
with BJS. It was administered to 8,707 youth sampled from at least 
one facility in every state and the District of Columbia.

The NSYC-2 is part of the National Prison Rape Statistics Program, 
which collects reported sexual violence in administrative records 
and allegations of sexual victimization directly from victims 
through surveys of inmates in prisons and jails and surveys of 
youth held in juvenile correctional facilities. BJS has collected 
administrative records annually since 2004. Victim self-reports 
have been periodically collected since 2007 (adult facilities 
only), followed by surveys in 2008-09 (adult and juvenile 
facilities) and 2011-12 (adult and juvenile facilities).

The universe for the NSYC-2 was all adjudicated youth residing in 
facilities owned or operated by a state juvenile correctional 
authority and all state-placed adjudicated youth held under state 
contract in locally or privately operated juvenile facilities. The 
universe was restricted to facilities that housed youth for at 
least 90 days, contained more than 25% adjudicated youth, and 
housed at least 10 adjudicated youth.

-------------------------------------------
The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 
(P.L. 108-79; PREA) requires the Bureau 
of Justice Statistics (BJS) to carry out 
a comprehensive statistical review and 
analysis of the incidents and effects of 
prison rape for each calendar year. This 
report fulfills the requirement under 
Sec.4(c)(2)(B)(ii) of the act to provide 
a list of juvenile correctional facilities 
according to the prevalence of sexual 
victimization.
--------------------------------------------

The NSYC-2 sampling frame included contract facilities in states 
where these facilities held at least 20% of all state-adjudicated 
youth or where fewer than 80 completed interviews were expected 
from youth held in state facilities. Since locally and privately 
operated facilities were more difficult to enroll and less likely 
to agree to participate in surveys related to the Prison Rape 
Elimination Act (PREA), the NSYC-2 excluded contract facilities in 
states in which they were not needed for state-level estimation. 
The NSYC-2 collected data from contract facilities in 15 states.

********************************************************
The NSYC-2 is a multistage probability sample providing 
representative data on state-adjudicated youth
*******************************************************

Facilities were selected using a multistage stratified sample 
design based on information obtained from the Census of Juveniles 
in Residential Placement (CJRP), which was conducted in 2010 by 
the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. At the 
first stage, 446 facilities were selected from the 503 eligible 
facilities identified in the CJRP. All facilities with 20 or more 
state-placed adjudicated youth were included in the survey. 
Smaller facilities (housing between 10 and 19 adjudicated youth) 
were sampled with probabilities proportionate to their size. (See 
Methodology for sample description.)

Of the sampled facilities, 113 were later determined to be out-of-
scope because they had closed, no longer held state-adjudicated 
youth, had merged with other facilities, or were no longer 
eligible for other reasons. Three additional sampled facilities 
were excluded due to scheduling problems and burden, and four 
facilities lacked consent for a sufficient number of youth to 
permit data collection. As a result, the NSYC-2 was conducted in 
326 facilities, representing 18,138 state-adjudicated youth held 
nationwide in state-operated and locally or privately operated 
juvenile facilities in 50 states and the District of Columbia.


The NSYC-2 survey consisted of an audio computer-assisted self-
interview (ACASI) in which youth used a touchscreen to interact 
with a computerized questionnaire and followed audio instructions 
delivered via headphones. The NSYC-2 used self-administered 
procedures to ensure the confidentiality of reporting youth and to 
encourage fuller reporting of victimization. The survey used audio 
technology to provide assistance to youth with varying levels of 
literacy and language skills. Approximately 99% of the interviews 
were conducted in English, and 1% in Spanish.

Administrators in each state, county, and private facility 
determined the type of consent required for youth to be eligible 
for participation. Youth who had reached the age of majority were 
able to self-consent, and contact with a parent or guardian was 
not required. Administrators provided in loco parentis (ILP) 
consent in 127 facilities for youth who were below the age of 
majority. In loco parentis is when administrators provide consent 
in the place of the parent to contact youth. Administrators 
required parental or guardian consent (PGC) from youth in 160 
facilities and collected a mixture of ILP and PGC in 39 
facilities, depending on the age of the sampled youth. Youth in 
all sampled facilities also had to assent to participate in the 
interview. (See Methodology for additional details on the consent 
process.)

In each sampled ILP facility, administrators were asked 5 weeks 
prior to data collection to provide a roster of all adjudicated 
youth assigned a bed. In other facilities (PGC or a mixture of 
consent requirements), administrators were asked to provide a 
roster 9 weeks prior to data collection. The initial rosters were 
updated to reflect youth admitted or discharged between the eighth 
and second week prior to data collection. Youth were randomly 
sampled from the initial and updated rosters.

Prior to the start of data collection, field staff assessed the 
interviewing capacity at each facility based on the number of 
available days, interviewing rooms, and interviewers. In 
facilities in which the NSYC-2 team had the capacity to complete 
all of the interviews, all youth for whom consent had been given, 
as well as youth who were able to self-consent, were selected. In 
other facilities, youth were randomly subsampled so the number of 
youth did not exceed interviewing capacity.

The result of this process yielded a sample of 22,944 state-
adjudicated youth held nationwide in state-owned or -operated 
juvenile facilities or placed in locally or privately operated 
juvenile facilities. A total of 9,703 youth participated in the 
survey. Of these, 8,707 youth completed the survey on sexual 
victimization, and 996 completed the survey on drug and alcohol 
use and treatment.

The NSYC-2 collected allegations of sexual victimization. Since 
participation in the survey was anonymous and reports were 
confidential, the NSYC-2 did not permit any follow-up 
investigation or substantiation through review of official 
records. Some allegations in the NSYC-2 may be untrue. At the same 
time, some youth may remain silent about any sexual victimization 
experienced in the facility.

To address concerns of false reporting by youth, reports of 
victimization were checked for consistency across survey items. 
Interviews that contained response patterns considered to be 
extreme or highly inconsistent were excluded from victimization 
rate calculations. (See text box below for details.) After 
deleting interviews due to extreme or inconsistent responses and 
interviews that were incomplete, the NSYC-2 sexual victimization 
survey and survey of alcohol and drug use and treatment were 
completed by 59% of all eligible sampled youth. (See Methodology 
for further details on sampling and survey participation.)

Terms and definitions
***********************

Sexual victimization--any forced sexual activity with another 
youth (nonconsensual sexual acts and other sexual contacts) and 
all sexual activity with facility staff.

Nonconsensual sexual acts--any forced sexual acts with another 
youth and all sexual acts with facility staff involving contact 
with the penis and the vagina or anus; contact between the mouth 
and the penis, vagina, or anus; penetration of the anal or vaginal 
opening of another person by a hand, finger, or other object; and 
rubbing of another person’s penis or vagina by a hand.

Other sexual contacts only--includes kissing on the lips or 
another part of the body, looking at private body parts, being 
shown something sexual, such as pictures or a movie, and engaging 
in some other sexual act that did not involve touching.

Staff sexual misconduct--all sexual activity with facility staff, 
including contact with the penis and the vagina or anus; contact 
between the mouth and the penis, vagina, or anus; penetration of 
the anal or vaginal opening of another person by a hand, finger, 
or other object; rubbing of another person’s penis or vagina by a 
hand; kissing on the lips or another part of the body; looking at 
private body parts; being shown something sexual, such as pictures 
or a movie; and engaging in some other sexual act that did not 
involve touching.

Staff sexual misconduct excluding touching--sexual activity with 
facility staff involving contact with the penis and the vagina or 
anus; contact between the mouth and the penis, vagina, or anus; 
penetration of the anal or vaginal opening of another person by a 
hand, finger, or other object; and rubbing of another person’s 
penis or vagina by a hand.

Forced sexual activity--includes sexual activity between youth and 
facility staff as a result of physical force or threat of physical 
force; force or pressure of some other type (e.g., threatening 
with harm, threatening to get the youth in trouble, pressuring the 
youth, or forcing or pressuring in some other way); and in return 
for money, favors, protection, or other special treatment.
*****************************************************

************************************
Interviews checked for extreme and 
inconsistent response patterns
**********************************
 
As with any survey, the NSYC-2 is subject to measurement error. To 
reduce this error, the survey incorporated several design 
features, including the use of an audio-assisted questionnaire 
delivered via headphones to address low levels of literacy; the 
use of “hot words” highlighted in a different color, which youth 
could access if they were uncertain about the definition; range 
checks for selected questions to guard against unrealistic values; 
and logic checks that asked youth to verify their responses. To 
assist youth who were having difficulty with the interview, the 
computer flagged those who spent a long period in particular 
sections of the interview and prompted the youth to obtain 
assistance from an interviewer. While these measures and others 
helped reduce error, they did not prevent it from occurring.

Once the interviews were completed, individual response patterns 
were assessed to identify interviews having extreme or internally 
inconsistent responses. Three response patterns were considered 
extreme and indicative of an unreliable interview overall. These 
patterns were--

* The core survey was completed in less than 10 minutes. Based on 
internal testing, it was determined to be extremely difficult for 
a respondent to seriously complete the interview in less than 10 
minutes.

* The reported number of sexual contacts with staff or forced 
sexual contacts with other youth exceeded 1.5 incidents per day 
for every day since admission to the facility.

* During the data collection visit, the facility received specific 
reports from youth that they had entered false responses to the 
survey.

Out of 8,845 completed interviews, 67 had at least one of the 
extreme response patterns. These interviews were excluded from the 
calculations of sexual victimization.

Thirty additional indicators were developed to assess whether a 
youth showed signs that he or she did not fully understand the 
survey items, did not consistently report the details of events, 
or provided inconsistent responses. One indicator was providing 
unrealistic dates or personal information, and another indicator 
was an affirmative response to a debriefing item that asked about 
difficulty understanding questions on sexual activity. Other 
indicators compared responses in one section of the survey with 
responses in other sections. (See appendix 3 for a full list of 
the indicators.)

The results of these 30 indicators were combined into a total 
number for each youth. About 90.4% of youth did not record any 
inconsistent responses, 7.0% reported one inconsistent response, 
1.8% reported two, and 0.8% reported three or more. For estimating 
sexual victimization rates, an additional 71 interviews were 
excluded based on three or more indicators of inconsistent 
responses.

Deleting extreme or inconsistent responses from estimates lowers 
the overall victimization rate since many of the indicators rely 
on checking the consistency of reported sexual victimization. The 
estimate for the overall sexual victimization rate would have been 
10.4% without deleting any interviews. The rate dropped to 9.5% 
after deleting 138 interviews that had at least one extreme 
response or three or more inconsistent responses. If interviews 
with two or more inconsistent responses were deleted, then the 
rate would have dropped to approximately 7.9%. If interviews with 
one or more had been deleted, the rate would have been 
approximately 5.0%. The cutoff at three or more inconsistent 
responses was selected in recognition that youth could 
legitimately report some inconsistent information without 
invalidating their entire interview.
*****************************************************

************************************
Prevalence of sexual victimization
************************************
------------------------------------------------------
About 10% of youth in state-owned or -operated 
juvenile facilities and state contract facilities 
reported one or more incidents of sexual victimization
-------------------------------------------------------

Among the 8,707 youth who participated in the 2012 survey, 833 
reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual 
victimization. Since the NSYC-2 is a sample survey, weights were 
applied for sampled facilities and youth within facilities to 
produce national-level and facility-level estimates. The estimated 
number of adjudicated youth who reported experiencing sexual 
violence totaled 1,720 (or 9.5% of the 18,138 estimated 
adjudicated youth held in state-owned or -operated or state 
contract facilities covered by the survey) (table 1).

About 2.5% of adjudicated youth (an estimated 450 nationwide) 
reported an incident involving another youth, and 7.7% (1,390) 
reported an incident involving facility staff. Some youth reported 
sexual victimization by both another youth and facility staff 
(0.7%) (not shown in table). Sexual acts or contacts between youth 
with no report of force or coercion were excluded from all 
measures of sexual victimization.

The NSYC-2 screened for specific sexual activities in which youth 
may have been involved during the past 12 months or since 
admission to the facility, if less than 12 months. Youth were 
asked to report which of these activities involved another youth 
and which involved staff at the facility. Additionally, youth were 
asked if any of these activities happened because they were 
forced, threatened with force, pressured in another way, or 
offered money, favors, special protection or other special 
treatment. (See appendices 1 and 2 for specific survey questions.) 
Reports of unwilling youth-on-youth sexual activity were 
classified as either nonconsensual acts or other sexual contacts 
only.

Approximately 1.7% of youth (300 nationwide) said they had 
nonconsensual sex with another youth, including giving or 
receiving sexual gratification, and oral, anal, or vaginal 
penetration. An estimated 0.6% (110) of adjudicated youth said 
they had experienced one or more other unwilling sexual contacts 
only with other youth, such as looking at private body parts, 
unwanted kissing on the lips or another part of the body, and 
other unwanted touching of specific body parts in a sexual way.

Reports of staff sexual misconduct with youth were classified 
separately depending on whether the misconduct involved any force, 
threat, pressure, or offers of special favors or protection. An 
estimated 3.5% of youth (630 nationwide) reported that they had 
sex or other sexual contact with facility staff as a result of 
force or other forms of coercion, and an estimated 4.7% (850) of 
youth said they had sexual contact with facility staff without any 
force, threat, or other explicit form of coercion.

******************************************************
Rates of sexual victimization in state juvenile 
facilities decreased from 12.6% in 2008-09 to 9.9% 
in 2012
******************************************************

Rates of sexual victimization reported by youth in state-owned or 
-operated juvenile facilities declined from an estimated 12.6% in 
2008-09 to 9.9% in 2012 (table 2). These estimates were based on 
interviews of 8,156 adjudicated youth in 169 sampled facilities in 
the NSYC-1 and 7,356 youth in 272 sampled facilities in the NSYC-
2. To compare rates across the two surveys, youth held in locally 
or privately operated facilities were excluded in both surveys due 
to differences in sampling and coverage. The criteria used to 
define inconsistent, extreme, and incomplete responses were also 
made comparable between the NSYC-1 and NSYC-2.

The overall decrease in reported sexual victimization was due to 
statistically significant declines in staff sexual misconduct with 
force (declining from 4.5% in the NSYC-1 to 3.6% in the NSYC-2) 
and staff sexual misconduct without force (from 6.7% to 5.1%). 
Although youth reported slightly lower rates of youth-on-youth 
sexual victimization in 2012 than in 2008-09 (decreasing from 2.8% 
to 2.5%), the decline was not statistically significant.

******************************************************
Declines in sexual victimization rates were linked to 
fewer youth held in large facilities, a drop in average 
exposure time, and rising positive views of facility 
staff and fairness
******************************************************

While many factors may account for the decline in sexual 
victimization rates in state juvenile facilities, the NSYC-2 
identified four important trends linked to sexual victimization 
rates.

* The proportion of youth held in large facilities dropped sharply 
from 2008-09 to 2012:

* An estimated 65.6% of youth in the NSYC-1 were held in large 
facilities (with 101 or more adjudicated youth), compared to 53.2% 
of youth in the NSYC-2 (table 3).

* The proportion of youth held in medium facilities (with 51 to 
100 youth) increased from 17.0% in 2008-09 to 24.0% in 2012.
In each survey, sexual victimization rates were two to three times 
higher in large facilities than facilities with 10 to 25 youth.

Among sampled youth, the average time youth had been held in 
facilities declined:

* As measured by the average exposure time (i.e., 12 months or the 
elapsed time between the admission date and the survey date for 
youth admitted to the facility in the last 12 months), the time 
that youth were at risk of sexual victimization decreased. The 
percentage of youth who were in the facility for less than 5 
months increased from 20.9% in the NSYC-1 to 26.9% in NSYC-2.

* When combined with a decline in the rates of sexual 
victimization reported by youth held for 5 to 6 months (from 13.4% 
to 10.0%) and youth held for 7 to 12 months (from 14.4% to 11.6%), 
this decline in exposure time was linked to the decrease in the 
overall rate of sexual victimization.

Youth in the NSYC-2 reported more positive opinions about the 
facility and fairness in how the facilities were run than youth in 
the NSYC-1. (See Methodology for a list of survey items.) Based on 
eight separate items, youth who had no positive opinions of the 
facility also reported the highest rates of sexual victimization 
(a third of sampled youth in each survey). Youth with four or more 
positive opinions about the facility had the lowest sexual 
victimization rates (5.5% in the NSYC-1 and 3.9% in NSYC-2).

Youth in the NSYC-2 also expressed more positive opinions of the 
facility staff than youth in the NSYC-1. When asked if staff were 
“good role models,” “friendly,” “genuinely car[ing],” “helpful,” 
“fun to be with,” “disrespectful,” “hard to get along with,” or 
“mean,” an estimated 60.0% responded with positive views in the 
NSYC-2 (up from 54.8% in NSYC-1). Across both surveys, youth with 
four or more positive opinions had the lowest sexual victimization 
rates (7.4% in the NSYC-1 and 4.6% in NSYC-2), while youth with no 
positive opinions of the facility staff had the highest sexual 
victimization rates (22.9% in the NSYC-1 and 23.5% in NSYC-2).

While changing youth opinions may reflect improved conditions in 
the facilities between the NSYC-1 and NSYC-2 surveys, they may 
also be the result of lower levels of sexual victimization by 
staff. Although the exact cause or effect is unknown, the improved 
perceptions of the facility and facility staff are associated with 
the decline in the percentage of staff sexual misconduct which 
underlie the overall decline in sexual victimization.

**********************
Facility-level rates
**********************

---------------------------------------
After taking into account statistical 
variation, thirteen facilities were 
identified as high-rate
---------------------------------------

Of the 157 juvenile facilities eligible for comparison in the 
NSYC-2, 13 had an overall victimization rate that was identified 
as high rate (table 4). Though other measures may be considered 
when comparing facilities, the overall victimization rate is a 
measure of prevalence that includes all reports of unwilling 
sexual activity between youth and all reports of staff sexual 
misconduct, regardless of the level of coercion and type of sexual 
activity. ***Footnote 1 Facility-level rates were based on the 
reports of adjudicated youth who were in the facility at least 2 
weeks prior to the time of the interview. Excludes the experiences 
of non-adjudicated youth and youth held in the facility in the 
past 12 months who were not in the facility when the interviews 
were conducted.***

An exact ranking for all facilities as required under the PREA 
cannot be statistically produced. As with any survey, the NSYC-2 
estimates are subject to sampling error because they are based on 
a sample of youth rather than a complete enumeration. In some 
facilities, youth were subsampled; in other facilities, all youth 
were selected. In 155 of the listed facilities (see appendix table 
1), some of the eligible youth did not participate in the survey 
due to the absence of consent by a parent or guardian, self-
consent, or assent by the selected youth.

To address nonresponse bias, adjustments were applied to the base 
weights. To address sampling variability, a 95%-confidence 
interval was provided for each survey estimate. Typically, 
multiplying the standard error by 1.96 and then adding or 
subtracting the result from the estimate produces the confidence 
interval. This interval expresses the range of values that could 
result among 95% of the different samples.

For small samples and estimates close to 0% or 100%, as is the 
case with the NSYC-2, using the standard error to construct the 
95%-confidence interval may not be reliable. An alternative 
developed by E.B. Wilson has performed better than the traditional 
method when constructing a confidence interval.***Footnote 2,3 
2Brown, L.D., Cai, T., & DasGupta, A. (2001). “Interval Estimation 
for a Binomial Proportion.” Statistical Science, 16(2), 101-117.
3Wilson, E.B. (1927). “Probable Inference, the Law of Succession, 
and Statistical Inference.” Journal of the American Statistical 
Association, 22(158), pp. 209-212.*** When applied to large 
samples, the traditional and the Wilson confidence intervals are 
virtually identical.

Consequently, the tables in this report containing facility-level 
and state-level estimates provide confidence intervals based on 
Wilson’s methodology (tables 4 through 8, table 10, table 17, 
appendix tables 2 through 5, and appendix table 7). Tables 
containing national estimates are based on traditional standard 
error calculations (tables 1 through 3, table 9, and tables 11 
through 16). (See Methodology for details.)

The 13 facilities were identified as having high rates because the 
lower bound of the 95%-confidence interval was at least 35% higher 
than the average rate among all facilities (9.5%) (figure 
1).***Footnote 4 The criterion of at least 35% higher than the 
average rate was established to identify a small group of 
facilities that would be considered as having high rates. Other 
criteria reflecting variation in the estimates would have 
identified a smaller or larger number of facilities.*** Although 
the NSYC-2 cannot uniquely identify the facility with the highest 
victimization rate, two facilities had rates of 30% or greater. 
Paulding Regional Detention Center (Georgia) recorded an overall 
rate of 32.1%, and Circleville Juvenile Correctional Facility 
(Ohio) recorded a rate of 30.3%. Birchwood (South Carolina) had a 
victimization rate of 29.2%.

While each of the 13 facilities had high rates, some facilities 
not classified as having high rates were not statistically 
different from the 13 high-rate facilities due to sampling error.

*******************************************
26 facilities had no reported sexual 
victimizations, and 14 of these facilities 
were identified as low rate
*******************************************

The NSYC-2 is unable to provide an exact identification of the 
facilities with the lowest rates of sexual victimization. Twenty-
six of the sampled juvenile facilities (17%) had no reported 
incidents of sexual victimization (see appendix table 2). Rates in 
each of the 26 facilities are subject to sampling error, depending 
on which youth were selected and the number of surveys completed 
by youth within the facility. Although in each facility the lower 
bound of the confidence interval was 0%, the upper bound varied 
depending on the number of completed interviews.

Among the 157 surveyed facilities, 14 were identified as low-rate 
facilities for sexual victimization based on the percentages of 
youth who reported incidents and the upper bounds of the 95%-
confidence intervals that were less than half the average rate 
among all facilities (table 5). All of the 14 low-rate facilities 
had no reported incidents of sexual victimization with the upper 
bound confidence interval between 1.5% and 4.7%. Ft. Bellefontaine 
Campus (Missouri), Owensboro Treatment Center (Kentucky), and 
Grand Mesa Youth Services Center (Colorado) had no reported 
incidents and had confidence intervals with upper bounds below 2%.

Campus (Missouri), Owensboro Treatment Center (Kentucky), and 
Grand Mesa Youth Services Center (Colorado) had no reported 
incidents and had confidence intervals with upper bounds below 2%.

*******************************************
Youth held in high-rate facilities reported 
high rates of nonconsensual sexual activity
*******************************************

Among the 13 high-rate facilities, most reports of sexual 
victimization involved nonconsensual sexual acts with another 
youth and sexual acts with facility staff excluding touching 
(table 6). When rates of sexual victimization were limited to the 
most serious nonconsensual acts (excluding touching only, kissing 
on the lips or another body part, and engaging in other less 
serious acts), the percentages of youth reporting one or more 
incidents remained high (between 16.2% and 28.8%).

Circleville Juvenile Correctional Facility (Ohio) had a 28.8% rate 
of sexual victimization excluding touching and a confidence 
interval with a lower bound (22.9%) that was more than three times 
the national average (7.1%). Six other facilities had rates of 
sexual victimization excluding touching that were more than double 
the national average and a confidence interval with a lower bound 
that was more than twice the national average.

Of the 13 high-rate facilities, one facility (Arkansas Juvenile 
Assessment and Treatment Center) had a youth-on-youth sexual 
victimization rate that exceeded 10% (table 7). In two facilities, 
none of the interviewed youth reported any sexual victimization by 
other youth in the facility. However, one of these facilities, 
Paulding Regional Youth Detention Center (Georgia), had the 
highest rate of staff-on-youth sexual victimization (31.0%).

High percentages of youth reported staff sexual misconduct in 
which no force, threat, or other forms of coercion were involved. 
Seven of the 13 high-rate facilities had rates of staff sexual 
misconduct (with no report of force) that were more than twice the 
national average (table 8). Two facilities--Paulding Regional 
Youth Detention Center and Circleville Juvenile Correctional 
Center--had a confidence interval around the rate of staff sexual 
misconduct (with no force) with a lower bound that exceeded 10%.

*******************************************
Rates of sexual victimization were strongly 
associated with basic facility characteristics
*******************************************

An initial examination of available facility characteristics 
revealed significant differences in sexual victimization rates: 
***Footnote 5 For the first time, the NSYC-2 included a facility 
questionnaire to obtain in-depth information about each sampled 
facility. Items included data on facility staff by sex, 
occupation, and length of service; staff turnover; personnel 
screening; facility capacity, occupancy, and crowding; use and 
type of video surveillance by area covered; type of facility and 
primary function; types of youth held and special problems; and 
types of treatment programs. These data and other facility 
characteristics will be examined in a second report from the NSYC-
2***

* State adjudicated youth held in state-owned or -operated 
facilities reported higher rates of staff sexual misconduct (8.2%) 
than those held in locally or privately operated facilities (4.5%) 
(table 9).

* Female-only facilities had the highest rates of youth-on-youth 
sexual victimization (5.7%), while male-only facilities had the 
highest rates of staff sexual misconduct (8.2%).

* Small facilities (those holding 25 or fewer adjudicated youth) 
had the lowest rates of staff sexual misconduct (1.3% among 
facilities with 1 to 9 youth, and 2.9% among facilities with 10 to 
25 youth). Larger facilities had higher rates of staff sexual 
misconduct (5.4% for those with 26 to 50 youth, 6.8% with 51 to 
100 youth, and 10.2% with more than 100 youth).

* Facilities in which youth were held for an average of less than 
5 months had the lowest rates of sexual victimization (6.8%), 
compared to facilities in which youth were held for longer periods 
(10.0% in facilities with an average exposure time of 5 to 6 
months, and 11.3% in facilities with an average of 7 to 12 
months).

*******************
State-level rates
*******************

In addition to facility-level and national-level estimates, the 
NSYC-2 was designed to provide state-level estimates. State 
estimates were added to provide more comprehensive feedback to 
administrators, especially to those who operate facilities that 
were too small to provide reliable facility-level estimates. 
State-level rates are particularly valuable in states comprised of 
small facilities. At least half of facilities in the NSYC-2 (169 
of 326 sampled facilities) were determined to be too small (with 
fewer than 15 completed interviews) or fell below standards of 
statistical precision needed for publishing facility-level survey 
rates. These facilities held approximately 30% of adjudicated 
youth covered in the NSYC-2. (See Methodology for discussion of 
reporting criteria.)

Using each facility’s measure of size, the state-level rates were 
created by combining the weighted average of the facility-level 
rates for published facilities with an estimate for the 
unpublished facilities. Except for 11 states, all published and 
unpublished facility rates were used (table 10). Including the 
unpublished facility with the rates for the published facilities 
would have made it possible to derive the rate for each 
unpublished facility. Excluding the 11 facilities in these states 
had a minimal impact on the state estimates. These facilities 
represented 10% or less of adjudicated youth for all but 2 of the 
11 states: Delaware and Nebraska. (See Methodology for discussion 
of state-level estimation.)

Three states (Delaware, Massachusetts, and New York) and the 
District of Columbia had no reported incidents of sexual 
victimization.*** Footnote 6  *** Although the samples of 
participating youth were relatively small, the upper bound of the 
95%-confidence interval in the District of Columbia and each of 
the three states fell below the national average (9.5%) across all 
states.

*******************************************
Four states were identified as high-rate 
for sexual victimization
*******************************************

While the NSYC-2 should not be used to provide an exact ranking of 
states, the same criteria that were used to classify facilities 
may be used to classify states. Six states had rates of sexual 
victimization that exceeded 15% (figure 2). Four of these states 
(Georgia, Illinois, Ohio, and South Carolina) may be identified as 
having high rates since the lower bound of the confidence interval 
around each estimate was at least 35% higher than the average rate 
among all facilities (9.5%).

A high percentage of adjudicated youth reported staff sexual 
misconduct in these four states (not shown; see appendix table 7). 
An estimated 17.1% of adjudicated youth in Ohio, 17.0% in South 
Carolina, 15.0% in Georgia, and 13.7% in Illinois reported one or 
more incidents of staff sexual misconduct. The lower bound of the 
confidence interval was 35% higher than the national average 
(7.7%) for estimates in each of these states. None of these states 
had rates of youth-on-youth sexual victimization that met the 
criteria to be classified as high.

*******************************************
Demographic and other youth characteristics
*******************************************

---------------------------------------------
Rates of sexual victimization were strongly 
related to specific youth characteristics
---------------------------------------------

* Rates of sexual victimization varied among youth:

* Males reported sexual activity with facility staff more often 
than females. An estimated 8.2% of males, compared to 2.8% of 
females, reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual 
activity with staff (table 11).

* Females reported forced sexual activity with other youth more 
often than males. About 5.4% of females and 2.2% of males reported 
forced sexual activity with another youth at the facility.
* Rates of staff sexual misconduct were higher among youth age 17 
(8.0%) and those age 18 or older (8.7%) than youth age 15 or 
younger (5.8%).

* White youth (4.0%) reported sexual victimization by another 
youth more often than black (1.4%) and Hispanic (2.1%) youth.

* Black youth reported a higher rate of sexual victimization by 
facility staff (9.6%) than white (6.4%) and Hispanic (6.4%) youth.

* Youth with a non-heterosexual sexual orientation reported a 
substantially higher rate of youth-on-youth victimization (10.3%) 
than heterosexual youth (1.5%).

* Rates of staff-on-youth sexual victimization increased with the 
length of time a youth was held in the facility. An estimated 
10.1% of youth who were in the facility for a year or longer 
reported sexual activity with a staff member, compared to 5.9% of 
youth who were in the facility less than 1 month, 6.3% of youth 
who were in the facility between 1 and 5 months, and 8.7% of youth 
who were held between 6 and 11 months.

* Youth who experienced any prior sexual assault were more than 
twice as likely to report experiencing one or more sexual assaults 
in the current facility (17.4%) than those with no sexual assault 
history (8.2%).

* Among youth who were previously sexually assaulted at another 
correctional facility, over half (52.3%) reported being sexually 
victimized at the current facility within the last 12 months or 
since admission, if less than 12 months. Among these youth, an 
estimated 33.5% were sexually victimized by another youth at the 
current facility, and 29.3% were victimized by staff.

****************************************
Circumstances surrounding the incident
****************************************

---------------------------------------
Most youth-on-youth victims (69.6%) 
reported more than one incident, and 
37.2% reported more than one perpetrator
---------------------------------------

In the NSYC-2, victims were also asked to provide information 
about the circumstances surrounding their victimization, including 
the number of times it happened, characteristics of the 
perpetrators, the type of physical force or pressure, when and 
where the incidents occurred, and whether or not they reported 
injury.

Data provided by youth who reported sexual victimization by 
another youth revealed that--

* About 69.6% were victimized more than once, while 18.9% were 
victimized more than 10 times (table 12).

* An estimated 37.2% of youth-on-youth victims were victimized by 
more than one perpetrator.

* An estimated 65.1% of victims said that they were victimized by 
a youth who was white, 57.2% said they were victimized by a youth 
who was black. In comparison, 32.2% of all adjudicated youth held 
in sampled facilities were white and 45.9% were black.

* The majority of victims (52.4%) said they were victimized at 
least once by a youth known to be in a gang.

* About 67.7% of victims reported experiencing physical force or 
threat of force, 25.2% were offered favors or protection, and 
18.1% were given drugs or alcohol to engage in the sexual act or 
other sexual contact (table 13).

* Most youth victimized by another youth (82.1%) reported no 
physical injury.

------------------------------------
Youth-on-youth sexual victimization 
occurred in areas throughout the 
facilities
------------------------------------

Among youth who reported unwanted sexual activity with another 
youth, 44.4% said they were victimized at least once in their room 
or sleeping area, and 31.0% said they were victimized at least 
once in the room or sleeping area of another youth. Nearly a third 
(32.7%) reported at least one incident taking place in a shower or 
bathroom, 25.0% said they were victimized in a recreation area, 
and 59.1% said at least one incident happened in some other common 
area, such as a classroom, library, kitchen, office, closet, or 
supply room.

Youth-on-youth sexual victimization was more common in the evening 
(between 6 p.m. and midnight) than at any other time. An estimated 
60.9% of the youth who reported unwanted sexual activity with 
another youth said at least one of the incidents occurred during 
those hours.

----------------------------------
Most perpetrators of staff sexual 
misconduct were female
----------------------------------

An estimated 92.4% of all youth who reported staff sexual 
misconduct said they were victimized by female facility staff 
(table 14).***Footnote 7 An estimated 91% of all adjudicated youth 
held in the sampled facilities were male. Approximately 44% of all 
staff and 34% of frontline staff in participating facilities were 
female. *** Among the estimated 1,390 adjudicated youth who 
reported victimization, 89.1% were males reporting sexual activity 
with female staff only, and 3.0% were males reporting sexual 
activity with both female and male staff.

An estimated 630 youth reported physical force, threat of force, 
and other forms of pressure and coercion by facility staff. Among 
these victims, 20.5% reported a male staff member as the 
perpetrator (15.0% involved male staff only and 5.5% involved both 
male and female staff).

Male staff members represented a smaller percentage of 
perpetrators among youth reporting staff sexual misconduct that 
did not involve any force. Among the 840 youth who experienced 
staff sexual misconduct without force, 5.1% reported the 
involvement of a male staff member (2.7% involved male staff only 
and 2.4% involved both male and female staff).

-------------------------------------------
Most victims of staff sexual misconduct 
(85.9%) reported more than one incident, 
while 20.4% reported being victimized more 
than 10 times
-------------------------------------------

Data provided by youth who were sexually victimized by facility 
staff revealed that--

* Approximately a third (32.0%) of youth were victimized by more 
than one staff member (table 15).

* About 20.3% of youth experiencing physical force or threat of 
force, 12.3% were offered favors or protection, and 21.5% were 
given drugs or alcohol to engage in the sexual act or other sexual 
contact.

* Most youth victimized by staff (93.9%) were not physically 
injured.

* Approximately 80.9% of victims said at least one incident 
occurred in a common area, such as a classroom, library, kitchen, 
office, closet, or supply room. Nearly half (48.9%) of victims 
said at least one incident occurred in a shower or bathroom, and 
more than half (52.5%) said they were victimized by staff in the 
youth’s room or sleeping area.

* Staff sexual misconduct most commonly occurred between 6 p.m. 
and midnight (53.5%), followed by incidents occurring between noon 
and 6 p.m. (49.4%).

* An estimated 41.1% of staff sexual misconduct victims said that 
the first sexual activity occurred during the first month at the 
facility (10.6% within the first 24 hours, 6.9% during the 
remainder of the first week, and 23.6% during the remainder of the 
month).

---------------------------------------
Staff sexual misconduct was linked to 
other inappropriate contact with youth
---------------------------------------

As a result of the high rate of staff sexual misconduct reported 
in the NSYC-1 (10.3%), new items were added to the NSYC-2 
questionnaire to better understand the circumstances surrounding 
incidents. Youth were asked a series of questions related to their 
relationship with the facility staff prior to sexual contact 
(table 16). Among victims of staff sexual misconduct--

* Nearly two-thirds said that staff told them about their personal 
life outside of work (69.1%), treated them like a favorite or 
better than other youth (63.6%), or gave them a special gift that 
the staff would not have given to most other youth (62.3%).

* Almost half (49.2%) said the staff member gave them pictures or 
wrote them letters. Nearly a third (29.8%) said that the staff 
member contacted them in other ways when the staff member was not 
at the facility.

* More than a third (36.7%) said youth gave the staff member 
pictures of themselves, and more than a quarter (28.1%) said youth 
gave the staff member a special gift.

When youth were asked who initiated the sexual contact, 36.4% said 
that the facility staff always made the first move, 17.4% reported 
that the youth always made the first move, and 46.3% said that 
sometimes the facility staff made the first move and sometimes the 
youth did.

Youth were also asked to describe the sexual relationship with 
staff. Nearly half (46.3%) said the incident was usually just 
sexual. An estimated 40.1% said the sexual contact was more like 
friends with benefits, and 13.6% said that they really cared about 
each other.

************

The second National Survey of Youth in Custody (NSYC-2) was 
conducted in all 50 states and the District of Columbia  by Westat 
(Rockville, MD), under a cooperative agreement with the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics (BJS). Data collection was conducted in 326 
juvenile facilities between February and September 2012.

Interviewing juveniles in residential facilities on such sensitive 
topics required extensive preparations with agency and facility 
administrators prior to the interview. These preparations ranged 
from methods to obtain consent, procedures to file mandatory 
reports of child abuse or neglect, arrangements for counseling in 
case a youth became upset, and logistical support to physically 
carry out the interviewing. The specific procedures that had to be 
negotiated with state and local authorities were--

* Consent to interview minors--22 states and the District of 
Columbia provided consent in loco parentis (ILP), in which the 
state agency acting as the guardian provided consent; 20 states 
required written consent and 3 states required either verbal or 
written parental or guardian consent (PGC); and 5 states allowed 
for a combination of ILP and PGC.

* Mandatory reporting of abuse or neglect--all survey staff in 
direct contact with youth had to comply with state and local 
reporting requirements when a youth made a verbal statement 
suggesting abuse or neglect. Jurisdictions provided contact 
information and instructions for submitting reports to an agency 
outside of the facility (e.g., local Child Protective Services).

* Counseling services--jurisdictions were asked to identify both 
facility-based and external resources for counseling services in 
the event a youth would become emotionally upset during the 
interview or make a specific request to the interviewer for such 
services.

* The NSYC-2 comprised two questionnaires--a survey of sexual 
victimization and a survey of past drug and alcohol use and 
treatment. Youth were randomly assigned one of the questionnaires 
so that, at the time of the interview, the content of the survey 
remained unknown to facility staff and the survey interviewers.

The interviews, which averaged approximately 30 minutes in length, 
used audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) data 
collection methods. Youth interacted with the computer-
administered questionnaires using a touchscreen and synchronized 
audio instructions delivered through headphones. Youth could 
choose to take the interview in either English or Spanish. Youth 
completed the interview in private, with the interviewer remaining 
in the room but in a position that did not offer a view of the 
computer screen.

A total of 9,703 youth participated in the NSYC-2. Of these, 8,707 
youth completed the survey on sexual victimization and passed 
editing and consistency checks. A total of 996 completed the 
survey on drug and alcohol use and treatment.

-----------------------
Sampling of facilities
-----------------------

The universe for the survey was all adjudicated youth residing in 
facilities owned or operated by a state juvenile correctional 
authority and all state-adjudicated youth held under contract in 
locally or privately operated juvenile facilities. The universe 
was restricted to facilities that housed youth for at least 90 
days, held at least 25% adjudicated youth, and held at least 10 
adjudicated youth at the time of the survey. These restrictions 
were imposed to allow sufficient time to obtain consent from the 
parent or guardian.

The NSYC-2 sampling frame included contract facilities in states 
where contract facilities held at least 20% of all state-
adjudicated youth or where fewer than 80 completed interviews were 
expected from youth held in state facilities. Since locally and 
privately operated facilities were more difficult to enroll and 
less likely to participate in surveys related to the Prison Rape 
Elimination Act (PREA), the NSYC-2 excluded contract facilities in 
states not needed for state-level estimation. Given these 
parameters, the NSYC-2 collected data from contract facilities in 
15 states.

A multistage stratified sample design was used. At the first stage 
of selection, 446 facilities were selected from 503 eligible 
facilities in the United States. Facilities were selected using 
the 2010 Census of Juveniles in Residential Placement (CJRP), 
conducted by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention.

* All facilities in the frame with 20 or more adjudicated youth 
were sampled with certainty. This threshold yielded at least one 
sample facility in each state except Vermont, which had one state 
facility that housed fewer than 10 adjudicated youth. (This 
facility was selected to meet the PREA mandate of including at 
least one facility in every state.)

* Facilities with 10 to 19 adjudicated youth were sampled with 
probability proportional to size. For state facilities, the 
measure of size was the number of adjudicated youth reported in 
the 2010 CJRP. For the contract facilities, it was the number of 
state-adjudicated placed youth. The selection probability of these 
facilities was their measure of size divided by 20. This number 
corresponded to the measure of size for the smallest certainty 
facility.

* A supplemental sample was taken to include additional contract 
facilities that were misclassified during the initial sample 
selection. An additional 10 facilities were selected from among 24 
reclassified facilities.

Subsequent state-level and facility-level enrollment efforts 
determined 113 of these 446 facilities to be out-of-scope. 
Facilities were out-of-scope under any of the following 
conditions:

* closed or were schedule to close prior to data collection (35)

* did not house youth for more than 90 days (49)

* did not house state-placed youth (13) or adjudicated youth (6)

* merged with another enrolled facility (6) or was split into two 
separate facilities (1)

* housed only youth with a limited cognitive capacity who were 
unable to self-consent or assent or complete the survey (2)

* no longer a juvenile corrections facility (1).

Of the remaining 333 eligible juvenile facilities, 4 lacked 
consent for a sufficient number of youth to permit data 
collection, and 3 were not visited due to issues related to 
scheduling and burden.

-------------------
Selection of youth
-------------------

Rosters of adjudicated youth were provided by facilities granting 
in loco parentis (ILP) consent 5 weeks prior to data collection. 
Facilities granting other forms of consent (either PGC or some 
combination of PGC and ILP) provided a roster 9 weeks prior to 
data collection. Rosters were updated weekly, up to 2 weeks prior 
to the collection, to reflect youth who were subsequently admitted 
to or discharged from each facility.

Interviewing capacity at each facility was assessed based on the 
number of available days, interviewing rooms, and interviewers. In 
facilities determined to have sufficient capacity, all eligible 
youth were selected for the survey. In other facilities, youth 
were randomly subsampled so the number of youth did not exceed 
interviewing capacity.

A total of 22,944 youth were initially selected. Among these 
individuals, 5,402 left prior to the interview team arriving at 
the facility and 940 were excluded based on subsampling within the 
facility. Once the discharges and excluded cases were removed from 
the pool of selected youth, 16,602 youth remained eligible for the 
NSYC-2.

Approximately 26% of youth did not participate because consent 
from the parent or guardian could not be obtained, 8% refused to 
complete the interview, and 6% were nonrespondents for other 
reasons (e.g., they did not complete the entire interview, they 
were not at the facility at the time of visit, the facility denied 
access, or they were excluded due to extreme or inconsistent 
response patterns).

-------------------------------------
Weighting and nonresponse adjustments 
for facility and national estimates
-------------------------------------

To generate facility estimates, each youth was assigned an initial 
weight that corresponded to the inverse of the probability of 
selection within each facility. A series of adjustments was 
applied to the initial weight to compensate for nonresponse. These 
adjustments were completed in three steps:

1. Adjustment cells were constructed based on each youth’s most 
serious offense, race or Hispanic origin, age, sex, and the 
number of days held in the facility.

2. An adjustment required a minimum nonresponse cell size of 10 
responding youth. In many facilities, this resulted in no 
nonresponse adjustment, as either the facility had too few 
interviews (fewer than 20) to create multiple cells or the 
differences between respondents and nonrespondents were not 
significant. In facilities where significant differences 
were observed, 2 to 4 nonresponse cells were created.

3. After an initial nonresponse adjustment, the weights within 
a facility were examined and trimmed to reduce undue 
influence from a small number of respondents with very large 
weights. If the highest weight was 4 times greater than the 
lowest weight in the facility, the highest weights were 
trimmed and the difference in weighted counts was 
distributed to the remaining youth. After trimming, the 
high-to-low ratio in the final weight would equal to 4.

To generate national estimates, each sampled facility was assigned 
a weight that corresponded to the inverse of the facility’s 
probability of selection into the sample, and the weight was 
adjusted for facility nonresponse. The adjusted facility weights 
were then multiplied by the youth weights that resulted from the 
three-step process outlined above, thereby producing a national-
level youth weight.

---------------------------
Calculating response rates
---------------------------

A total of 8,845 youth completed the survey on sexual 
victimization, and 996 completed the survey on drug and alcohol 
use and treatment. After excluding 138 youth whose interviews were 
deleted due to extreme or inconsistent responses in the sexual 
victimization survey, the NSYC-2 achieved a weighted overall 
response rate of 59% for all sampled youth. (See box on page 9 for 
discussion of extreme and inconsistent response patterns.)

Separate response rates were calculated for each participating 
facility. (See appendix table 1.) Within each facility, a base 
weight was created for each youth in the sexual victimization 
survey by taking the inverse of each youth’s probability of 
selection. In most facilities, youth selection probabilities were 
the same; however, in facilities in which youth were subsampled or 
where rosters contained duplicate records, selection probabilities 
varied.

An initial facility response rate was calculated by summing the 
base weights for all youth who completed the sexual victimization 
survey and dividing it by the sum of the base weights for all 
sampled youth. Ineligible youth in each facility were excluded. 

A final response rate was calculated to account for deleted 
interviews that contained extreme or inconsistent responses. (See 
discussion on page 9.) This was achieved by multiplying the 
initial facility response rate by an adjustment ratio. In each 
facility, this ratio represented the sum of final weights for all 
interviewed youth (excluding those with extreme or inconsistent 
responses) divided by the sum of final weights for all interviewed 
youth (including those with extreme or inconsistent responses). 
This final adjusted response rate was then multiplied by 100.

Calculations for Adobe Mountain School (Arizona) illustrate the 
measurement of these weighted facility-level response rates. This 
facility listed 284 youth on its roster. Among those listed, 124 
were subsampled out, and no interview was attempted with them. 
Among the remaining 160 sampled youth, 144 were sampled for the 
sexual victimization survey and 16 for the survey of past drug and 
alcohol use and treatment. Of the 144 eligible youth, 105 
completed the NSYC-2 sexual victimization survey (72.9%). After 
adjusting for the probability of selection for each youth, the 105 
youth who completed the sexual victimization survey represented 
the 284 youth in this facility. Five of the interviewed youth 
(4.8%) provided extreme or three or more inconsistent responses 
and were excluded. After adjusting for these cases, the resulting 
facility response rate was 69.4% (0.729 times 0.952 times 100).

-------------------------------------
Selecting facilities for publication
-------------------------------------

Facility-level estimates were published only if they met a set of 
criteria to ensure that the estimates had minimum reliability. The 
estimates were required to meet all of the following criteria: (1) 
they were based on at least 15 youth who completed the sexual 
victimization survey, (2) they represented facilities with a 30% 
response rate or greater, and (3) they had a minimum coefficient 
of variation of 30% and were significantly precise to detect a 
high victimization rate (i.e., if they had a hypothetical 
victimization rate of 25% or greater, the lower bound of the 
confidence interval would be 35% higher than the national rate). 
(See Standard errors and confidence intervals section below for 
discussion of sampling precision.)

Based on these criteria, facility-level estimates were reported 
for 157 (of the 326) participating facilities. (See appendix 
tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 for facility estimates by type of sexual 
victimization.) These facilities accounted for approximately 70% 
of the adjudicated youth covered in NSYC-2.

----------------------
State-level estimates
----------------------

State-level estimates were generated using a weighted average of 
the facility-level rates. Except for 11 states in which one 
participating facility did not meet the criteria for publication, 
all published and unpublished state rates were used. In these 11 
states, publishing a rate for the entire state, along with the 
rates for the published facilities, would have made it possible to 
derive the rate for the unpublished facility.

Four approaches were used to produce state estimates:

1. In 14 states and the District of Columbia, facility-level 
estimates were published for all participating facilities. A 
state-level rate was calculated by dividing the combined 
weighted counts of youth reporting sexual victimization in 
all facilities by the combined weighted count of all youth 
in all of the participating facilities. (These states 
included Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Maine, 
Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, 
West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.)

2. In 11 states, facility-level estimates were published for 
all participating facilities except one. A state-level rate 
was calculated by dividing the combined weighted counts of 
youth reporting sexual victimization in the published 
facilities by the combined weighted counts of all youth in 
the published facilities. (These states included Alabama, 
Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, New 
Mexico, South Carolina, Tennesee, and Virginia. The excluded 
facility accounted for 10% or less of the state population 
in all states except Delaware and Nebraska.)

3. In 17 states, one or more facilities had a published rate, 
and two or more facilities did not have a published rate. A 
state-level rate was estimated by calculating a weighted 
average from the unpublished facilities and combining it 
with the weighted average of the estimates from published 
facilities. (These states included Alaska, Arkansas, 
Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, North Carolina, North 
Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, and Washington.)

4. In six states, no facility-level estimates were published, 
but all facilities together met the publication criteria. A 
state-level rate was estimated by combining the data from 
all unpublished facilities based on the original 
probabilities of selection and weighting adjustments. (These 
states included California, Massachusetts, Maryland, New 
York, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.)

In two states (Connecticut and New Hampshire), no facility-level 
estimates were published and all facilities combined did not meet 
the publication criteria. In these states, the NSYC-2 could not 
provide a state-level estimate.

-----------------------------------------
Standard errors and confidence intervals
-----------------------------------------

Survey estimates are subject to sampling error because they are 
based on a sample rather than a complete enumeration. Within each 
facility, the sampling error varies by the size of the estimate, 
the number of completed interviews, and the size of the facility. 
Due to the relatively small samples within many of the selected 
facilities, it is especially important to consider the possibility 
of sampling error when interpreting the survey results.

Estimates of the standard errors for selected measures of sexual 
victimization are presented in tables that provide national-level 
estimates. These estimates may be used to construct confidence 
intervals around the survey estimates (e.g., numbers, percentages, 
and rates), as well as to test for significant differences between 
the estimates.

For example, the 95%-confidence interval around the percentage of 
male youth who reported sexual victimization by another youth is 
approximately 2.2% plus or minus 1.96 times 0.2% (or 1.8% to 
2.6%). Based on similarly conducted samples, 95% of the intervals 
would be expected to contain the true (but unknown) percentage.

The standard errors may also be used to construct confidence 
intervals around differences in the estimates. The 95%-confidence 
interval comparing the percentage of male youth (2.2%) and female 
youth (5.4%) who reported sexual victimization by another youth 
may be calculated. The confidence interval around the difference 
of 3.2% is approximately plus or minus 1.96 times 0.82% (the 
square root of the standard error of the difference). The standard 
error of the difference is calculated by taking the square root of 
the sum of each standard error squared (e.g., the square root of 
(0.2)2 plus (0.8)2). Since the interval (1.6% to 4.8%) does not 
include zero, the difference between male youth and female youth 
in the rate of sexual victimization by other youth is considered 
statistically significant.

To express the possible variation due to sampling associated with 
facility-level estimates, tables in this report provide lower and 
upper bounds of the related 95%-confidence intervals. Since many 
facility samples are small and the estimates are close to zero, 
confidence intervals were constructed using an alternative method 
developed by E.B. Wilson. Computationally, this method produces an 
asymmetrical confidence interval around the facility estimates, in 
which the lower bound is constrained to be greater than or equal 
to 0%, and the upper bound is less than or equal to 100%. It also 
provides confidence intervals for facilities in which the survey 
estimates are zero (but other similarly conducted surveys could 
yield non-zero estimates).

------------------
Exposure period
------------------

To calculate comparative rates of sexual victimization, the 
facility provided the most recent admission date to the current 
facility for each youth. If the admission date was at least 12 
months prior to the date of the survey, youth were asked questions 
related to their experiences during the last 12 months. If the 
admission date was less than 12 months prior to the interview, 
youth were asked about their experiences since they arrived at the 
facility. The average exposure period for sexual victimization 
among sampled youth was 6.2 months.

---------------------------------
Measuring sexual victimization
--------------------------------

The NSYC-2 relied on the reporting of direct experience of each 
youth, rather than youth reporting on the experience of other 
youth. The strategy was to first ask if the youth had engaged in 
any type of sexual activity at the facility within the last 12 
months or since they entered the facility, if they had been in the 
facility for less than 12 months. These questions were not 
specific to the perpetrator or whether the sexual activity was 
coerced.

The initial series of questions differed by the age of the youth. 
Youth age 15 or older were administered questions related to the 
touching of body parts in a sexual way, involving oral, anal, or 
vaginal sex. Youth age 14 or younger were asked less detailed 
questions about sexual activity. Rather than referring to explicit 
body parts and acts, the items had less explicit language (i.e., 
“private parts”). This was done to avoid exposing younger 
respondents to explicit sexual references. (For specific survey 
questions, see appendix 1.)

Youth who reported sexual activity were then asked if the 
activities occurred with other youth or with staff. They were then 
asked questions about the presence and nature of coercion 
(including use of physical force or threat of physical force, use 
of other type of force or pressure, or return for money, favors, 
protection, or other special treatment) associated with the youth-
on-youth sexual activity. A separate but identical set of 
questions was asked about coercion associated with staff-on-youth 
sexual activity. (See appendix 2.)

If the respondent did not report any sexual contact in the initial 
screening items, the ACASI survey administered a series of 
questions that asked if the youth had been coerced to engage in 
sexual activity. If a youth answered affirmatively, he or she was 
asked if the event occurred with another youth or with a staff 
member. Follow-up questions, comparable to the initial screener 
questions, were asked of those who reported victimization.

The ACASI survey presented additional questions related to both 
youth-on-youth and staff-on-youth sexual victimization. These 
questions collected further information on the characteristics of 
the victimization, such as time and location, number, race or 
Hispanic origin, and sex of perpetrators; injuries sustained and 
medical care received by the youth as a result of the assault; 
characteristics of the relationship between youth and staff 
perpetrators; and reporting of the assault to authorities and 
action taken by leadership after the victimization.

--------------------------------------------
Measuring youth opinions about the facility 
staff and fairness of facility policies
--------------------------------------------

The NSYC-1 and NSYC-2 included eight yes or no items that measured 
youth opinions about facility staff:

B1a. Are the facility staff good role models?

B1b. Are the facility staff friendly?

B1c. Do the staff seem to genuinely care about you?

B1d. Are the staff helpful?

B1e. Are the staff disrespectful?

B1f. Are the staff hard to get along with?

B1g. Are the staff mean?

B1h. Are the staff fun to be with?

“Yes” responses to items B1a, B1b, B1c, B1d, and B1h and “no” 
responses to items B1e, B1f, and B1g were coded 1. All other 
responses were coded 0. The response codes were then summed to 
provide a count of the number of positive opinions about the 
facility staff.

The number of positive opinions about the facility and fairness of 
facility policies was based on seven true or false items and one 
agree or disagree item:

B2a. Youth here are punished even when they don’t do anything 
wrong.

B2b. Facility staff use force when they don’t really need to.

B2c. Problems between facility staff and youth here can be worked 
out.

B2d. Something bad might happen to me if I file a complaint 
against a staff member.

B2e. I usually deserve any punishment that I receive.

B2f. Punishments given are fair.

B2g. The staff treat the youth fairly.

B2i. There are enough staff to monitor what is going on in this 
facility (strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree, 
strongly disagree).

“False” responses to items B2a, B2b, and B2d and “true” responses 
to items B2c, B2e, B2f, and B2g were coded 1.  “Strongly agree” 
and “somewhat agree” responses to item B2i were coded 1. All other 
responses were coded 0. The response codes were then summed to 
provide a count of the number of positive opinions about the 
facility and fairness of facility policies.

The entire ACASI questionnaire (listed as the National Survey of 
Youth in Custody-2) is available on the BJS website at 
www.bjs.gov.

----------------------------------------------------------------

*******************************************
The 13 facilities classified as high-rate 
were examined using additional exclusion 
criteria for extreme or inconsistent 
responses
*******************************************

The impact of the choice of exclusion criteria on the 
classification of high-rate facilities was examined 
(table 17). The data suggest that 10 of the 13 facilities would 
have remained in the high-rate group had additional (more 
restrictive) exclusion criteria been introduced.

One facility, John G. Richards (South Carolina), would have 
dropped out of the high-rate category if the calculations had 
excluded interviews in which youth reported a sexual victimization 
incident but failed to respond when asked how many times it had 
occurred or answered zero times. While the facility rate would 
have remained high (15.8%), the lower bound of the 95%-confidence 
interval (10.2%) would have been less than 135% of the national 
mean (less than 9.0% times 1.35, or 12.2%).

The John G. Richards facility also would have dropped out of the 
high-rate group if calculations had excluded interviews with two 
or more inconsistencies (with a mean of 15.8% and a lower bound of 
10.2%) or if calculations had excluded interviews based on one or 
more inconsistencies (a mean of 8.6% and a lower bound of 4.4%). 

Of the remaining 12 facilities, 2 facilities (Paulding Regional 
Youth Detention Center, Georgia, and Birchwood, South Carolina) 
would have dropped out only if interviews with any inconsistent 
response had been excluded. The rate of sexual victimization in 
the Paulding Regional Youth Detention Center would have dropped 
from 32.1% to 5.0%, and the rate at Birchwood from 29.2% to 4.6%. 
These two facilities had the smallest number of respondents (fewer 
than 30) among the 13 high-rate facilities, and consequently were 
the most sensitive to deleting interviews.

Consideration of other exclusion criteria did not change the 
classification of the remaining 10 facilities (not shown in 
table). These 10 remaining facilities would have been classified 
as high-rate even if interviews were dropped based on reports of 
an incident rate of more than one per week since the admission 
date or based on a case-by-case review of all items for internal 
consistency. 

Overall, the data suggest that classifying the 13 facilities as 
high-rate is robust. In choosing to exclude interviews based on 
one or more extreme responses or three or more inconsistent 
responses, some youth may still report inconsistent information 
but their entire interview should not be invalidated.
