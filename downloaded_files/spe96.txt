Highlights 

For Fiscal year 1996 States and the District of Columbia
reported that they spent $22 billion for adult prisons -- to
build, staff, and maintain the facilities and to house the
prisoners.  The Federal Bureau of Prisons spent an additional
$2.5 billion.

These estimates come from a study based on the 1996 Survey of
Government Finances, conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.
On behalf of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), government
finance specialists contacted State budget officers and
department of corrections officials and elaborated the survey
data for corrections categories.  (See the box on this page
summarizing the included and excluded expenditures and
Methodology for details.)

What activities and expenditures does the survey cover?

Included*                                    Excluded
         Adult prison operations                   Prisons not holding inmates during FY 1996
         Wages, salaries, benefits                 State juvenile justice activities
         Food service                              Probation and parole services

         Transportation and utilities
         Inmate programs
         Capital outlays
         Facility construction and renovation
         Major repairs
         Land and building purchases

*Expenditures are net amounts after deductions  
for revenue from prison farms, industries, and services.

----------------------------------------------------------------

The Nation's prisons cost $24.5 billion in 1996

*Prison operations accounted for about 80% of all State
correctional expenditures in 1996.  The remaining 20% was for
juvenile justice activities, probation and parole services, and
community-based corrections.

Average inmate cost approximately $20,100 per year      

*When prison operating expenditures were divided by the average
number of inmates incarcerated during 1996, the nationwide
average annual cost to house each State inmate was $20,100, and
each Federal inmate, $23,500.

State and Federal prison spending up after 1990

*State prison expenditures increased  83% from $12 billion in
1990 to $22 billion in 1996, an average of about 11% per year.

*Federal prison expenditures rose 160% from $946 million in 1990
to $2.5 billion in 1996, an average of about 17% per year. 

Nearly all money was used for daily operations

*Approximately $1.3 billion, or 6% of State prison expenditure
in 1996, went for new construction, renovations, major repairs,
equipment, land and building purchases, and other major
nonrecurring outlays, leaving $20.7 billion, or 96% for
salaries, wages, benefits, and other operating expenses.

Prison costs per U.S. resident increased

*The total annual burden of State correctional expenses rose
from $53 (in constant 1996 dollars) per U.S. resident in 1985 to
$103 in 1996.

*Per resident spending for State prisons increased each year an
average 7.3% between 1985 and 1996 -- about twice the 3.6%
annual average rise in spending for State education. 

*The annual per resident cost of State prison operation alone
increased from $40 in 1985 to $79 in 1996.

Prison costs were related to factors outside the correctional
system

*Average operating costs per inmate in 1996 varied by State,
reflecting wide differences in costs of living, prevailing wage
rates, and other factors over which corrections administrators
have little control.

*The highest average annual operating cost per State inmate
occurred in Minnesota, ($37,800) and the lowest in Alabama
($8,000).

Five core expenses cost State prison systems  more than $5
billion in FY 1996

*Outlays for services, programs, and  activities related to
inmate medical and dental care, including employee salaries,
were about 12% of all State prison operating expenditures in
1996.  



*Medical and dental care cost an annual average of $2,386, or
$6.54 per day for each inmate.

*Daily expenditures per inmate for other State prison activities
included the following: inmate programs, $3.28; food service,
$2.96; utilities, $1.81; and transportation and travel, $0.52. 

----------------------------------------------------------------
Employee salaries and benefits accounted for the majority 
of prison expenditures

*Salaries and wages for prison staff were the largest regularly recurring
by far, totaling more than $10.7 billion, or about half of State prison 
expenditures.

*Employer contributions to employee  benefits were the second largest
item, at $3.1 billion, or 14% of the total.

Several operational factors were associated with prison costs

*Across the States high overall inmate-to-staff ratios were
associated with low average costs per inmate.

*States that maintained facilities with larger capacities tended
to report lower average costs per inmate than States having
smaller facilities.

*Some States were unable to separate community corrections from
prison expenditures.  This accounting difference resulted in
higher reported operating costs per prisoner in those States. 

Introduction

This report presents comparative data on the cost of operating
adult confinement facilities, generally referred to as prisons,
in each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia during
Fiscal year 1996.  Prisons are defined as correctional
facilities in which less than 50% of the inmates  regularly
leave the institution, unaccompanied, to work or study in the
community.

Expenditures of prisons not in operation during Fiscal year 1996
are excluded, as are State juvenile justice, probation and
parole services, and nonresidential community-based corrections.

Expenditures, as used in this study, include the entire amount
of money paid out, including principal and interest, investment
in securities, extensions of loans, and agency transactions. 
All figures are net amounts after deductions for
revenue-generating activities such as farm produce and
industrial products and services.  

Unlike correctional cost studies based on budgeted numbers or a
combination of budgeted and expended amounts, this study focuses
exclusively on expenditures.  It includes State-level data on
employee salaries, wages, employer contributions to employee
benefits, operating costs per inmate, and capital outlays for
facility construction, renovations, major repairs, land and
building purchases.  Additional information is presented on the
costs of prison food service, inmate programs, medical care,
transportation and utilities.

Assuming available time and resources, BJS anticipates
completing a future State prison expenditure study based on
State reporting of FY 2001 data.

Since 1971 BJS and its predecessor agencies have published
Justice Expenditure and Employment (CJEE), a series which
includes  information on State correctional expenditures. The
CJEE is broad-based, describing the expenditures of both States
and localities for all correctional activities,  police
protection, and judicial and legal activities.  It also reports
the number of State and local criminal justice employees by
function and payroll status. A BJS Justice Expenditure and
Employment publication is available for 1992, and reports for
1993 through 1995 are being prepared.

Unlike the CJEE, the BJS expenditure antecedent to State Prison
Expenditures 1996  focused exclusively on State correctional
facility costs and was based on individual facilities.  As part
of the 1984 and 1990 Censuses of State Correctional Facilities,
State-level information was gathered on total, operating, and
capital expenditures of individual State prison systems. 
Reporters within each facility provided expenditure data, with
information on facility physical characteristics, inmate
population, health and safety conditions, staff, and programs.

In developing the 1996 data collection, BJS sought to enhance
the comparability of jurisdictions.  In past collections cost
figures of some States included juvenile services. Other States
reported probation and parole activities together with prison
costs.  Transfer payments from State agencies outside the
department of corrections were not always counted. 
Transportation costs, employee benefits, medical services, and
other line items were included in the total expenditures
reported by some respondents but not by others.

In the 1996 data collection, the U.S. Census Bureau's FY 1996
survey of Government Finances was accessed and information
pertaining to State institutional corrections expenditures was
extracted to provide the nucleus of the material used to produce
State Prison Expenditures 1996.  See Methodology for information
on the methods used to extract the correctional expenditures and
other data collection procedures.

During the early stages of this expenditures project, the
State/Federal Committee of the Association of State Correctional
Administrators received a BJS briefing.  Afterwards the
committee received preliminary findings and a prepublication
copy of the final results.

Total expenditure, 1985-96

State correctional costs more than doubled between 1985 and 1996

According to data reported by each State in the U.S. Census
Bureau's annual Survey of Government Finances, the Nation's
expenditures on State correctional activities rose 115% from
approximately $12.7 billion in 1985 to $27.3 billion in 1996
(figure 1).   (Footnote: Federal correctional spending, as a
non-State cost,  was outside the scope of this study.  However,
Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) officials reported separately
that outlays for its prison operations in FY 1996 amounted to
nearly $2.5 billion, or about 10% of the Nation's prison
expenditure.  BOP's  annual operating expenditure per inmate was
$23,500.  In 1990, these numbers, adjusted for inflation, were
$946 million and $16,800, respectively.)

Expenditures specifically for State prison activities increased
from $9.6 billion in 1985 to $20.9 billion in 1996.  Interviews
with State budget officials by the Bureau of the Census for this
report produced a revised 1996 estimate of $22 billion.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Each year between 1985 and 1996 States increased their spending
for all corrections an average 7.2% and for prisons alone an 
average 7.3%

----------------------------------------------------------------

Total State correctional expenditures include the cost of
operating prisons and related institutions such as
reformatories, prison farms, institutions exclusively for the
criminally insane, institutions for the reception, evaluation
and classification of inmates; and   correctional facilities for
the treatment of drug addicts and alcoholics.  In addition to
prison operations, State correctional expenditures include
juvenile detention and correctional activities, parole boards
and programs, pardon boards, probation activities, including
those administered by courts, and correctional administration
not directly connected to institutions. 

State costs per resident for corrections increased faster than
costs for education, health, and natural resources

As an annual cost per U.S. resident, total State correctional
spending rose from $53 in 1985  to $103 in 1996. Per resident
outlays for State prison operations alone rose from $40 in 1985
to $79 in 1996.  State correctional spending increased an
average 7.2% per year, and spending for prisons specifically,
7.3%.  Such spending was about twice the annual increase for
State education (3.6%) and more than twice the increase for
State natural resources (2.9%).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Although State corrections costs grew at a faster rate than some
other areas from 1985 to 1996, corrections' relative share of
the total outlay remained small.  At $994 billion, State
spending for education in FY 1996 was nearly 10 times larger
than that for corrections, and public welfare was about 7 times
larger.

Expenditures, fiscal year 1996

States spent $22.0 billion on prisons  in FY 1996

State prison expenditures -- total State corrections minus
probation, parole, juvenile justice, and community corrections
activities --reached $22,033,214,000 in fiscal 1996.  

California had the largest State prison expenditure, a $3
billion annual payment, and North Dakota had the smallest State
expenditure, $10.7 million (table 1).

The largest State prison expenditures 
in FY 1996:

     California     $3.0 billion
     New York        2.2
     Texas           1.7
     Florida         1.2
     Michigan        1.2

The smallest State prison expenditures in FY 1996:
  
      North Dakota     $10.7 million
      Wyoming           29.0
      Vermont           33.5
      South Dakota      34.2
      New Hampshire     43.0 

States spent approximately $94 of every $100 on current
operations

Two-thirds of the States spent 94% or more of their prison
dollars on current operations, such as salaries, wages, fees,
commissions, supplies, contractual services, and general
maintenance activities. Oregon, Tennessee, and Vermont reported
that nearly all of their funds designated for prisons went for
current operations in FY 1996.  Ohio spent the least (86%),
followed by Washington and Wisconsin which spent 87%.

The Nation's total operating expenditure for State prisons in FY
1996 ($20,737,888,000) divided by the average number of State
prisoners incarcerated during the period (1,029,595), resulted
in an estimated average operating expenditure per inmate of
$20,142 per year, or $55 per day.  See Methodology for a
description of the estimated average daily inmate population for
FY 1996. 

In 1990 the inflation-adjusted nationwide operating cost per
inmate, as reported by State facility respondents, was $18,400,
and in 1984 it was $16,300.    

Nearly half of all jurisdictions in 1996 had per-inmate costs in
the $20,000 to $30,000 range.  Operations  were nearly twice as
costly in the Northeast as in the South, and about a third
higher in the Northeast than in the Midwest and West.

Eight States, all but one of which was located in the South, had
annual operating costs per inmate of less than $15,000, while 
seven  States had annual costs of more than $30,000:

New Jersey              30,773

Note:  All but Rhode Island, Connec-
ticut, and New Jersey used a portion
of prison expenditures to fund com-
munity corrections.  See page 14.  

Numerous factors were associated with State-by-State differences
in prison costs.  Cost-of-living, prevailing wage rates,
geography, and a variety of other factors contributed to each
State's costs.  Measuring these elements was beyond the scope of
this study.  However, for a discussion of the variations in
State correctional expenditures, see "Differences in prison
costs."

Capital expenditures

Most States spent about $6 out of every $100 on prison capital
projects

States spent an average of $6 out of every $100 for new
construction, renovations, major repairs, equipment, land,
buildings, and other nonrecurring outlays during FY 1996.  Less
than 1% of total expenditures were allocated to capital projects
in Oregon, Tennessee, and Vermont, compared to 14% in Ohio and
13% in Washington and Wisconsin.

Slightly more than three-fifths of State capital outlays in FY
1996 went for building construction and renovation projects such
as additions, replacements, and major alterations, including
fees for the professional services of architects, engineers,
appraisers and attorneys.

In terms of capital outlays, nearly a quarter was spent on
equipment purchases and installations, furnishings, office
equipment, motor vehicles, and other devices having a useful
life of more than 5 years.  The remainder -- about a seventh of
all capital funds -- was invested in land acquisitions, debt
payments, and related costs (table 2).

In Hawaii and Maryland all capital expenditures for FY 1996 were
reported as construction and renovation costs, whereas in
Arizona, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Michigan, Idaho,
Montana, New Mexico, and Vermont, equipment consumed the entire
capital account.  

Land-related costs accounted for only a small share of most
States' capital expenditures in 1996.  In New York, however,
these expenditures made up nearly two-thirds of the total and in
Indiana, nearly a third. 

Operating expenditures

About two-thirds of operating costs went for prison employee
salaries, wages, and benefits

Salaries and wages accounted for slightly more than half of
total operating expenditures, nationwide; employee benefits,
about a seventh; and other operating costs, approximately a
third (table 3).

The wide State-by-State variation in the distribution of
operating expenditure components highlights the importance of
considering all operating costs together when making comparisons
between jurisdictions.  For example, in Massachusetts prison
employee salaries and wages accounted for 67% of the State's
total operating expenditures and for about 60% of the
expenditures in the District of Columbia, Oklahoma, New York,
and Illinois.  

By contrast, in Kentucky, Oregon, and Tennessee about a third of
total operating expenditures were allocated for prison employee
salaries and wages.  

Like salaries, employee benefits varied from a high of 26% in
Michigan to a low of 3% in Massachusetts.  The other operating
costs category ranged from as much as 59% of the total prison
operating expenditure in Tennessee to as little as 16% in
Michigan.

Five core expenditures provide a prison cost profile

Over a quarter of current operating expenses in State prisons in
FY 1996 involved inmate medical care, food service, inmate
programs, utilities, and transportation and travel expenses
(table 4).

Medical care

States spent nearly $2.5 billion on prisoner medical and dental
care in FY 1996, or about 12% of total prison operating
expenditures (table 5).  Outlays for  medical services provided
by full-time and part-time government staff and managed care and
fee-for- service providers averaged $2,386 per inmate during the
year, or $6.54 per day.  By comparison, in 1995, the latest year
with data, on average each U.S. resident spent $1,807 or $4.95
per day for his or her own health care. (Footnote:  U.S. Health
Care Financing Administration, Health Care Financing Review,
fall 1996.)

Correctional systems face a variety of factors influencing the
cost of inmate medical care.  Some prison systems may be making
up for the inadequate care of chronic disorders among the
prisoners before they were admitted.  Some systems are in States
where everyone pays above average medical costs.  Some systems
are in States with high incidence of risky behaviors that cause
disease.  Some States may have an exceptional number of
high-cost medical cases, such as AIDS or kidney failures.  How a
State chooses to staff or pay for its medical care and how a
State distributes its specialized care among facilities also
influence expenditures.

In FY 1996 medical costs accounted for about 14% of the total
prison operating expenditures in the South, 12% in the West, 11%
in the Midwest, and 10% in the Northeast.  Total annual medical
expenditures ranged from $378 million in California to $622,000
in North Dakota.

Six States had daily medical costs per inmate above $10: 
Michigan, $12.57; Wyoming, $11.31; New Hampshire, $11.20;
Alaska, $11.12; Pennsylvania, $10.18; and Washington, $10.13. 
Four were below $3 a day:  Oklahoma, $2.25; North Dakota, $2.76;
South Carolina, $2.80; and Alabama, $2.84.

Food service

At $1.1 billion, nationwide, outlays for State prison food
services during  FY 1996 were slightly less than half as large
as the costs for medical care (table 6).  In absolute terms,
California spent the most to feed its inmates ($178 million),
and North Dakota spent the least ($660,000).  South Dakota
allocated the largest percentage of its operating expenditure on
food service (10%), and Maine and New Jersey, the smallest
percentage (3%).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, State prison systems spent about $2.96 per day on
inmate food service.  In the West ($3.59), Midwest ($3.65), and
Northeast ($3.44) average costs were slightly higher than in the
South ($2.20) where prison farm produce and other
inmate-generated measures may have helped to reduce food costs.  

The highest daily State expenditure for food service was in
Pennsylvania ($5.60 per inmate), nearly 7 times greater than
that in Alabama, which had the lowest daily food cost per inmate
($0.84).

Inmate programs

States spent approximately $1.2 million in FY 1996 on inmate
programs involving academic and vocational training, substance
abuse awareness and treatment programs, religious activities,
parenting, job search preparation, life skills training,
recreation and exercise, and related activities  (table 7). 
This  amount was slightly more than for food service and equal
to about 6% of the Nation's total State prison operating
expenditure.

*Program expenditures are underreported.  Some States reported expenditures for selected
programs only.  Other States were unable to separate program expenditures from general
operating costs.  A national estimate was calculated, adjusting for nonreporting. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

Reporting of inmate program expenditures was too uneven to
permit State-by-State presentation.  About a fourth of the
States could not separate inmate program spending from general
operating costs.  Jurisdictions that could report separate
numbers did not always know the total outlays because other
agencies met some of the costs.  Some State health departments
may have provided mental health counseling and substance abuse
treatment.  Some State departments of education may have
partially defrayed the costs of  teachers for GED classes or
other academic or vocational training.

Utilities

State prison utility costs totaled $682 million in FY 1996, or
about 3.3% of total prison operating expenditures (table 8).
Utilities were the only core prison cost which all State
respondents could report completely.  The category includes gas
and electricity for heat and air conditioning, cooking, and
lighting as well as water and sewerage service.  Utilities do
not include telephone service.

Prison utility expenditures varied across geographic areas: 
Average annual costs per inmate were highest in the Northeast
($957), followed by the Midwest ($675), the West ($626), and the
South ($570).

Daily utility costs ranged from $4.59 per inmate in Maine and
$3.18 in Minnesota to $0.85 in Louisiana and $0.97 in Oklahoma.

Transportation

Inmate transportation and staff travel activities cost State
prisons systems $197 million in FY 1996, or about 1% of their
total operating expenditures (table 9).

Approximately half of all reported transportation and travel
money associated with State prisons in FY 1996 was spent in
California, Florida, New York, and Michigan, which reported
prison transportation bills of $25.6 million, $25 million, $19.1
million, and $17.9 million, respectively.


Reported annual transportation and travel expenditures per
inmate in FY 1996 ranged from $766 in Rhode Island and $598 in
Delaware to $45 in Hawaii and $66 in Texas.  The Adult
Correctional Institutions (ACI) division, according to Rhode
Island's Department of Corrections, "is responsible for the
transportation of the adult and juvenile populations to court
facilities, and transports inmates to and from other states....
The ACI functions both as a prison system for offenders
sentenced to incarceration and as a statewide jail facility for
individuals awaiting trial or arraignment..."

Like Rhode Island, Delaware operates a combined jail/prison
system with added cost for jail inmate movement.  

Differences in prison costs

Numerous factors associated with State-by-State differences in
prison costs

Much of the variation between States in the cost of operating
prisons fell outside the control of State administrators: 
Differences in the cost of living, variation in prevailing wage
rates, climate, geography, and a variety of other human and
natural factors contributed significantly to each State's 
prison cost equation. Measuring these elements was beyond the
scope of this study.  However, a number of factors related to
correctional operations were possible to analyze.

Inmate-to-staff ratios

Inmate-to-staff ratios had a clear relationship with operating
costs per inmate.  This relationship was tied to employee
salaries and wages that accounted for more than half of total
State prison operating costs.

High inmate-to-total-staff ratios were most common in States
reporting low  average costs per inmate, and low inmate-to-total
staff ratios predominated in States with high average annual
costs per inmate. 

States with the lowest inmate-to-total-staff ratios: 

         Inmates per  Operating cost
         employee     per inmate per day
Maine           1.5        92
Vermont         1.8        85
Minnesota       1.9       104
New Mexico      1.9        81
New Hampshire   1.9        57

States with the highest inmate-to-total-staff ratios:

            Inmates per  Operating cost
            employee     per inmate per day
Alabama          6.4          22
Oklahoma         4.7          29
Nevada           4.7          42
Louisiana        4.6          34
Mississippi      4.4          31

Similar patterns were observed between inmate-to-security-staff
ratios and average costs per inmate.  High
inmate-to-security-staff ratios were most common in States with
low average costs per inmate, and low inmate-to-security-staff
ratios were most likely to prevail in jurisdictions 
with high average costs per inmate.

States with the lowest inmate-to-security-staff ratios:

                 Inmates per         Operating cost 
                 security employee   per inmate per day
Vermont                2.3               $85
Maine                  2.4                92
Minnesota              3.0               104
New Mexico             3.0                81
New Hampshire          3.0                57


States with the highest inmate-to-security-staff ratios:

            Inmates per         Operating cost
            security employee   per inmate  per day
Oklahoma         8.5                  $29
Nevada           7.1                   42
California       7.0                   59
Oregon           6.6                   87
Ohio             6.1                   54


Average number of inmates per facility

The overall pattern between average number of inmates per
facility and costs per inmate suggests that a small amount of
cost savings resulted from the operation of larger capacity
prisons.

Average facility size showed some relationship with average
annual operating costs per inmate:  Eight States with annual
costs per inmate of less than $15,000 reported average numbers
of inmates per facility of 400 or greater, including 2
jurisdictions with average prison sizes greater than 1,300. 

By contrast, 7 States with average costs per inmate of $30,000
or more had average numbers of inmates per facility of less than
800, including 2 with average of less than 200.   


In the remaining 36 jurisdictions, which had intermediate costs
per inmate, there was wide variation in the average number of
inmates per facility and no clear relationship between average
facility size and cost per inmate.

Transfer payments

Transfer payments include intergovernmental monies from one
government to another, including grants-in-aid, fiscal
assistance, and amounts for services performed by one government
for another, such as payments for boarding prisoners. Transfer
payments also refer to intra-governmental payments from one
department or agency to another within the same government. 
Some jurisdictions provide transfer payments on a reimbursable
basis.  In Washington, for example, all transfer money received
for employer contributions to prison employee benefits is repaid
from department of corrections funds.

Nearly two-thirds of the Nation's State departments of
corrections received and applied some transfer payments to their
adult institutional corrections accounts in FY 1996. 
Departments of corrections in the South received about 8% of
their total expenditures from transfer payments, compared to
about 4% in other regions.

A fifth or more of total prison expenditures in four States came
from transfer payments:  Tennessee, 25%; Louisiana, 24%; and
Colorado and Oregon, 20% each.  Eight States used transfer
payments to meet a portion of salary and wage obligations; 15
States used them for part of employee benefits; and 33 States
used them for other operating costs:

                Transfer payments as a

Facility security level 

The  average security level at which a State's prisons operated
showed no clear relationship with average operating costs per
inmate:  Both very high ($30,000 and higher) and very low (less
than $15,000) annual operating costs per inmate were reported in
States having relatively large percentages of facilities rated
as maximum security. 

By contrast, moderate annual operating costs per inmate of
$15,000 to $25,000 were most common in States with relatively
large percentages of facilities rated as minimum security.

States in the South operated the largest percentage of maximum
security facilities (23%), yet the average operating cost per
inmate in the South was the lowest of any region ($15,338).  In
the Northeast, where costs per inmate were among the  highest
($28,966), only 16% of the facilities were rated as maximum
security.  In the Midwest, however, where operating costs per
inmate were in the middle range averaging $21,919, over half of
all prisons were rated as minimum security.


Community corrections

Most States budgeted and paid for  nonresidential community
corrections expenditures out of separate accounts from prison
operations.  As a result, community corrections spending was
largely outside the scope of this study.

However, six States - - Alaska, Maine, Minnesota, Oregon, Utah,
and Vermont - - each used a portion of  prison expenditures to
fund community corrections activities, a practice which affected
comparisons with other jurisdictions' spending to a greater or
lesser extent, depending on the proportion of the prison budget
affected.

Comparison of Minnesota's expenditures with other jurisdictions
was the most affected because it allocated 38% of its prison
expenditure in FY 1996 for community corrections. Vermont's
prison outlay was also clearly affected, as it allocated 31% of
its prison spending to community corrections.  It was possible,
however, to delete the entire community corrections outlays from
these two States' total expenditures so that their prison
spending could be appropriately compared to that of other States.


Comparisons of the operating costs of Alaska, Maine, Oregon,
Rhode Island, and Utah with other States were not appreciably
affected, as less than 2% of each of these  jurisdiction's
prisons expenditures were allocated to community corrections.

BJS asked government finance specialists at the U.S. Census
Bureau to identify each State's corrections function codes
reported in the FY 1996 Survey of Government Finances and enter
this information into a data base, using a standardized format
developed by BJS.  This extraction procedure included both inter
and intragovernmental transfer payments, and clarified missing,
repetitious, and out-of-range data items.  

State department of corrections budget officers and central
office accounting specialists were also contacted and asked to
review the originally reported numbers, a process which for some
States involved numerous phone calls and revisions of the
original figures.  They helped Census Bureau staff to eliminate
duplicate reports, interpret expenditure classification codes,
and understand organizational functions and accounting
procedures. 

Budget officials were especially helpful in adding expenditures
for central office staff who performed prison activities, and in
removing expenditures pertaining to probation and parole
services, juvenile corrections, and nonresidential community
corrections -- areas that were outside the adult prison
function.    

After each jurisdiction's designated financial reviewer agreed
with its final numbers, Census Bureau staff  completed the data
revision phase of the project with a 100% response rate for
total, operating, and capital expenditures.  The response rates
for the five core expenditure groups were as follows: Utilities,
100%; food service, 98%; medical care, 92%; transportation, 88%;
and inmate programs, 76%.

To  analyze prison costs in relation to other factors, BJS
augmented the completed data set with variables from the 1995
Census of State and Federal Correctional Facilities, including
facility size, facility security level, and staff
characteristics.  Contextual background for Fiscal 1996 total
State corrections expenditures and expenditures for State
prisons came from separate censuses:  Censuses of Government
Finances for FY 1985 through FY 1995 (U.S. Bureau of the Census)
and the 1984 and 1990 Censuses of State Correctional Facilities
(BJS).


Data limitations 

A variety of factors made expenditures reported for fiscal year
1996 not completely comparable with those of earlier years.
Fiscal year 1996 State expenditures were reported by State
budget officials, based on categories established by the Census
Bureau's annual Survey of Government Finances.  

Fiscal year 1996 and 1990 Federal expenditures were reported by
the Budget Execution Branch of the Federal Bureau of Prisons,
using internal accounting procedures. 

State expenditures for 1984 and 1990 were reported by
correctional facility respondents.  Actual State prison
expenditures in 1984 and 1990 may have been higher than
published numbers because of  underreporting of employee
benefits, interagency transfer payments, and other expenses.   

Adjusting for inflation

In this report, State government expenditures for FY 1985 to FY
1995 were inflation-adjusted in 1996 constant dollars, as
appropriate for government spending.  The following annual
chain-type price indexes for the gross domestic product were
employed as divisors and unadjusted expenditures as dividends to
produce inflation-adjusted expenditures in 1996 
constant dollars:

These indexes were developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce,
Bureau of Economic Analysis, and are presented in Economic
Report of the President, February, 1998, Table B-7.

Underreporting 

Correctional expenditures shown in figure 1 and the appendix
table may be underreported.  Discussions between State budget
officials and Bureau of the Census specialists in government
finances who collected the data for this report produced a
revised nationwide figure for State prisons in FY 1996 of $22
billion,  an amount 5.4% higher than the original total reported
in the 1996 Survey of Government Finances.

 

Various factors accounted for the revised FY 1996 State
corrections spending figure, including adjustments for central
office staff assigned to prison, probation, parole and juvenile
activities; elimination of duplicate fund reporting; and access
to final numbers following State submission of preliminary
numbers in the Census of Government Finances.

Correctional expenditures may be underreported.  Detailed interviews of 
State budget officials by the Bureau of the Census for this report produced 
a revised estimate of $22 billion for FY 1996, 5.4% higher than 
the $20.9 billion reported in the 1996 Survey of Government Finances. 
*The Bureau of the Census conducted full censuses of State and local 
finances in 1987 and 1992.

Estimating average daily population

Inmate population estimates for FY 1996 were based on respondent
reports from the BJS National Prisoner Statistics (NPS-1)
series.  To account for variable growth during the year, the
State totals as of June 30, 1996, were added to those as of
December 31, 1995, and then averaged. Then the totals as of
December 31, 1995, were added to those as of June 30, 1995, and
averaged. Finally, the two averages were averaged to derive the
estimated inmate populations for each State.

U.S. resident population
  

Sources for U.S. population statistics used to calculate costs
per U.S. resident include the following U.S. Bureau of the
Census publications:  

For 1985, Estimates of the Population, by Type: April, 1980 to
July 1, 1990-Series P-25, No 1064; for 1990 

to 1995, U.S. Estimates by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin:
1990 - Series PPL-41; for 1996, Resident Population - Estimates
by Age, Sex, Race and Hispanic Origin, consistent with the 1990
Decennial Census, as enumerated.
