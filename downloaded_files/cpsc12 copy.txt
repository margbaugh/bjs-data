Census of Problem-Solving Courts, 2012
*****************************************

Former BJS Statistician

In 2012, the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) Census of 
Problem-Solving Courts (CPSC) counted 3,052 problem-solving 
courts in the United States (figure 1). The most common types of
problem-solving courts were drug courts (44%) and mental health 
courts (11%) (figure 1). Most courts (53%) reported that they 
were established prior to 2005, including drug (64%), youth 
specialty (65%), hybrid DWI/drug (63%), and domestic violence
(56%) courts.

Problem-solving courts are a relatively recent development in the 
U.S. criminal justice system. These courts were created to 
address underlying problems that result in criminal behavior. 
Problem-solving courts are typically diversionary, meaning that a
participant agrees to follow the guidelines of the court to avoid 
prosecution, incarceration, or other typical criminal justice 
outcomes. The criminal problem-solving court concept has been 
extended to civil and family court, such as family dependency 
matters, and to address the needs of certain populations, such as
justice-involved veterans.

HIGHLIGHTS
*************

* In 2012, 65% of all problem-solving courts accepted cases after 
the defendant entered a guilty plea.

* More than half (56%) of problem-solving courts in 2012 did not 
accept applicants with a history of violent crime and nearly two-
thirds (65%) did not accept applicants with a history of sex 
offenses.

* In 38% of veterans courts and 11% of domestic violence courts, 
applicants with a history of violent crime were ineligible.

* Fifty-three percent of all problem-solving courts active in 
2012 were established prior to 2005.

* Most veterans courts (55%) were established between 2011 and 
2012.

* Participants in problem-solving courts spent a median of 1 year 
in the program in 2012. 

* Overall, 57% of all problem-solving courts reported that more than half of the exits were successful program completions.

* Twenty-one percent of youth specialty courts reported that 100% 
of participants completed the program in 2012.

* Successful program completion commonly included dismissal of 
the case (61%) or a suspended sentence (40%).

* Fewer than half (44%) of all problem-solving courts tracked 
participant progress after program completion in 2012.
***************************************************************

The CPSC was sent to 3,633 problem-solving courts thought to be 
operational in 2012 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia 
and the territories of Guam and Puerto Rico. Of the originally 
targeted courts, 3,052 were in existence in 2012 and 2,793 
responded to the survey. (See Methodology for more information.)

On behalf of BJS, staff at the National Center for State Courts 
emailed respondents to explain the CPSC project and provided a 
hyperlink to the online questionnaire. For courts that were 
unwilling or unable to complete the survey online, a paper 
questionnaire was mailed later in the data collection process or 
at the respondent’s request. The respondent was directed to 
answer one questionnaire per problem-solving court. If 
respondents had multiple problem-solving courts under their 
control, they were to complete a separate questionnaire for each 
court. (See Problem-solving court definitions and distribution by 
state text box.)

****************************************************************
*****************************************
Problem-solving court definitions 
and distribution by state
******************************************

Problem-solving courts were established to treat other underlying 
causes of crime (e.g., drug addiction, mental health issues, or 
homelessness) or to address the needs of specific populations 
(e.g., veterans).

Problem-solving courts that met each of the following conditions 
were included in the 2012 census:

* used therapeutic justice*** Footnote 1 Therapeutic justice 
focuses on rehabilitating offenders using some form of counseling 
and on minimizing punishment.***to reduce recidivism

* operated within the judiciary

* led by a judicial officer

* had an exclusive docket

* had participants that were admitted or that exited in 2012, or 
indicated that it was operational but did not have eligible 
participants enrolled in 2012.

In the 2012 Census of Problem-Solving Courts (CPSC), a problem-
solving court was defined as specialized program or docket that 
operates within a jurisdiction or set of jurisdictions. A single 
jurisdiction could run multiple problem-solving courts, or 
multiple jurisdictions could participate in a single problem-
solving court. The unit of count for the survey was the problem-
solving court. If a problem-solving court had participants from 
multiple jurisdictions, it was counted once. If one jurisdiction 
runs three distinct problem-solving courts, then three problem-
solving courts were counted.


The CPSC identified many types of problem-solving courts. Often, 
these courts can be classified under more than one type. For 
example, a juvenile drug court in Indian country could also be 
labeled as a tribal wellness court. In these situations, the 
respondent’s self-classification was used. For a small number of 
surveys in which the respondent did not affirmatively indicate a 
primary attribute, the problem-solving court was classified using 
other responses.

Problem-solving courts were classified using the following 
typology:

* Drug courts handle an underlying drug problem contributing to 
criminal behavior using nontraditional judicial proceedings and 
treatment with team-based services. These courts include adult 
drug courts, juvenile drug courts, and reentry drug courts, which 
could either address adult or juvenile populations. *** Footnote 2 
Although one juvenile drug court was located on tribal lands, it 
self-identified as a juvenile drug court and was counted in that 
category and not as a tribal wellness court.***

* Mental health courts divert defendants with mental illness, 
traumatic brain injury, or developmental disabilities into 
judicially supervised, community-based treatment. Mental health 
courts include adult mental health courts, juvenile mental health 
courts, and adult co-occurring disorder courts.

* Family problem-solving courts (referred to as family courts) 
handle juvenile or family court cases of child abuse or neglect, 
adjudication of parental rights, or custody and visitation, in 
which parental substance abuse is a contributing factor.

* Youth specialty courts serve juvenile offenders and address 
underlying issues that result in court involvement. Youth 
specialty courts include youth/teen courts and truancy courts.*** 
Footnote 3 Seven courts that specifically served youth ages 16 
and 17 who were charged in adult criminal courts were classified 
as youth specialty courts.***

* Hybrid driving while intoxicated (DWI)/drug courts handle 
alcohol- or drug-dependent offenders who have also been charged 
with a driving offense.

* DWI courts focus on changing the behavior of the alcohol-
dependent offender or offenders with a high blood alcohol content 
who were arrested for DWI or driving under the influence. DWI 
courts include juvenile DWI courts.

* Domestic violence courts handle criminal cases that involve 
offenses against persons who are related in some way, most often 
through intimate partnership or family relationship. Domestic 
violence courts include integrated domestic violence courts, 
which combines a docket for both domestic violence and family 
issues (e.g., custody and visitation). ***Footnote 4 Two of the 
five courts classified as domestic violence courts were “other” 
courts that indicated they were youth domestic violence courts. 
Three were hybrid courts handling domestic violence and drug 
abuse cases.***

* Veterans courts serve justice-involved veterans and sometimes 
active-duty personnel. These courts include veterans drug courts, 
veterans mental health courts, and general veterans courts.


* Tribal wellness courts are in the tribal justice system and 
incorporate the wellness concept to meet the specific substance 
abuse needs of each tribal community. Tribal wellness courts 
include Tribal Healing to Wellness Courts and tribal hybrid 
courts.

* Other courts include adult community, homelessness, general 
problem-solving (courts that address multiple case types and 
serve a variety of defendants with underlying problems), reentry 
(except reentry drug courts), parole violation, gambling, gun, 
prostitution, elder abuse, and other specialty courts. Because 
this category contains many types of courts, it is rarely 
described in this report. 

The number of problem-solving courts varied by state and 
territory in 2012. California (208) and New York (188) 
had the most problem-solving courts (table 1). Vermont 
(6) and Guam (5) had the fewest.
*************************************************************

***************************************
Development of problem-solving courts
***************************************

In 2012, a majority (61%) of problem-solving courts were located 
in counties with a population of 100,000 or more
*************************************************************

The distribution of problem-solving courts varied by the type of court 
and the size of the population served. In 2012, the total resident 
population in the jurisdiction served by each problem-solving 
court ranged from 3,800 to 9,826,800. ***Footnote 5 The resident 
population includes all counties served by the problem-solving 
court. Courts identified as municipal courts included the 
population of the city of the court.*** About a quarter of these 
courts were either in large jurisdictions with populations 
greater than 500,000 or in small jurisdictions with populations 
of 50,000 or fewer (table 2). More than a third (36%) were 
located in jurisdictions with populations between 100,001 and 
500,000. Large jurisdictions had a disproportionately high number 
of veterans, domestic violence, and mental health courts, while 
small jurisdictions had a disproportionately high number of 
hybrid DWI/drug courts and a disproportionately low number of 
mental health, domestic violence, and veterans courts.


1 in 8 problem-solving courts active in 2012 
were established in 2011 or 2012
***************************************************

Some problem-solving courts that were active in 2012 reported 
admitting their first participants as early as 1989. Half of 
problem-solving courts (53%) reported that they were established 
prior to 2005. Nearly two-thirds of drug (64%), youth specialty 
(65%), and hybrid DWI/drug (63%), and more than half of domestic 
violence (56%) courts were instituted prior to 2005 (table 3). 
Existing youth specialty courts reported that they were 
established early in the history of problem-solving courts. Half 
(49%) of youth specialty courts reported that they were 
established before 2001, including 9% that were established 
between 1989 and 1990 (not shown). In comparison, veterans, DWI, 
and mental health courts were established more recently. More 
than half (55%) of veterans courts reported being established in 
2011 or 2012, and 37% reported being founded between 2006 and 
2010. More than half (54%) of DWI courts reported being 
established between 2006 and 2010, and 18% reported being founded 
in 2011 or 2012. DWI (72%) and mental health (64%) courts 
reported being established between 2006 and 2012.

****************************************
Admissions to problem-solving courts
****************************************

In 2012, most problem-solving courts admitted 
participants after a plea was entered
********************************************* 

Problem-solving courts varied by the point at 
which they intervene in a case. Some courts took cases that had 
reached a specific processing stage, while others took on cases 
at multiple processing points. Additionally, problem-solving 
courts accepted multiple case types and identified different 
entry points for criminal or civil and family cases. In 2012,
35% of problem-solving courts accepted a case at filing or prior 
to a plea, while 64% accepted a case after a plea was entered 
(table 4). Most (73%) domestic violence courts accepted cases at 
case filing or prior to a plea. Half (50%) of youth specialty 
courts accepted a case prior to a plea. Most (61%) family 
problem-solving courts accepted a case after a judicial order, 
which can occur at any point during a case’s life-cycle. More 
than 8 in 10 (85%) hybrid DWI/drug courts accepted a case after a 
plea was entered.

In 2012, in most problem-solving courts applicants 
with a history of violent crime or sex offenses 
were ineligible 
*******************************************************

Participants had to meet certain criteria to be accepted into a 
problem-solving court. In 2012, most problem-solving court 
participants with a history of violent (57%) or sex (65%) 
offenses were ineligible (figure 2). Domestic violence and 
veterans courts were exceptions to this pattern. The majority 
of domestic violence courts accepted participants with a 
history of violent crime (89%) or sex offenses (88%). 
The majority of veterans courts (62%) accepted participants 
with a history of violence.

Most problem-solving courts admitted fewer than
50 participants in 2012 and did not exceed 
reported capacity
********************************************************

In 2012, courts varied in the number of participants admitted. 
About 3 in 4 courts (72%) admitted fewer than 50 individuals in 
2012 (table 5). Among domestic violence court, 78% admitted 50 or 
more individuals and 20% admitted 500 or more in 2012. The large 
majority of tribal wellness courts (91%) admitted fewer than 20 
individuals in 2012.

Capacity was defined as the maximum number of participants a 
problem-solving court could manage. Most problem-solving courts 
(61%) reported a capacity of 20 to 99 participants (appendix 
table 3). Most family problem-solving courts (86%) and tribal 
wellness courts (100%) reported a capacity of fewer than 50 
individuals. Domestic violence courts were larger, with a 
majority (59%) reporting a capacity of 100 or more.

Among problem-solving courts that reported the number of active 
participants in 2012, more than half (53%) reported between 10 
and 49 active participants (appendix table 4). Tribal wellness 
courts had the fewest active participants, with more than half 
(52%) reporting nine or fewer. Domestic violence courts had the 
most active participants, with more than half (53%) reporting 100 
or more.

Most problem-solving courts reported that the number of active 
participants was within or below their reported capacity. In 
2012, 5% of courts with a capacity of 19 or fewer individuals 
operated over that capacity, as did 1% of courts with a capacity 
of 20 to 49 and 4% of courts with a capacity of 50 to 99 
(table 6).

*******************************************
Participation in problem-solving courts
*******************************************

In 2012, almost 90% of all problem-solving 
courts held preliminary reviews to discuss 
participant progress prior to the official 
status hearing 
*******************************************

Problem-solving courts met periodically to monitor a participant’s 
progress through the court’s program. Depending on the type of 
court, an official status hearing was held daily, weekly, or 
monthly. The staff in most courts met prior to the official 
court review to discuss the participant’s progress. Nearly 
two-thirds (63%) of all problem-solving courts reported meeting 
at least weekly to review the progress of their participants 
(table 7). Most (91%) problem-solving courts required the 
participant to attend the court hearing. Of these courts, 99% 
reported that the judge interacted directly with the participant 
at the court hearing.

Youth specialty courts and domestic violence courts met on a 
different schedule than most other problem-solving courts. 
Twenty-one percent of youth specialty courts met weekly, and 30% 
met monthly or more than once per month but less frequently than 
weekly (34%). Forty-two percent of youth specialty courts 
reported that the participant was required to attend status 
hearings. Of these courts, 90% reported that the judge interacted 
directly with the participant. More than a quarter of domestic 
violence courts met daily (28%), and more than a third met weekly 
(35%). Eighty percent of domestic violence courts required the 
participant to attend status hearings. Of these courts, 98% of 
domestic violence status hearings involved direct interaction 
between the judge and the participant.

Most (88%) problem-solving courts reported that staff held 
preliminary reviews of each case prior to status hearings 
(table 8). Forty percent of youth specialty courts and
45% of domestic violence courts met to review cases prior to the 
official court hearing. Of the courts that held preliminary 
reviews, judges and service providers were present in 93% of 
these reviews, while probation agents were present in 90%, and 
prosecutors and defense attorneys were present in 79%. Law 
enforcement officers were present in 40% of preliminary reviews.

Substance abuse treatment was the most 
commonly reported service used by 
problem-solving court participants in 2012
************************************************

Problem-solving courts reported services used by at least 10% of 
active participants. Most (87%) problem-solving courts reported 
that they offered and participants used substance abuse 
treatment, ranging from 41% of youth specialty courts to 97% of 
family courts (appendix table 6). Most (89%) problem-solving 
courts reported that they offered and participants used 
individual counseling sessions, ranging from 63% of domestic 
violence courts to 96% of tribal wellness courts. Almost three 
quarters (72%) of all courts offered and participants used some 
form of life skills training (e.g., time management), ranging 
from 40% of domestic violence courts to 92% of family courts. In 
2012, half (49%) of all problem-solving courts offered and 
participants used anger management programs, ranging from
26% of DWI courts to 71% of veterans courts.

*************************************************************
********************************************
Juvenile drug and mental health courts
********************************************

Drug (1,330) and mental health (301) courts were divided into 
subgroups based on the population served. Approximately a quarter 
of drug courts (23%) and a tenth of mental health courts (11%) 
were designated exclusively for juveniles (figure 3). ***Footnote 
6 Seventeen adult drug courts accepted juvenile cases.*** Many 
court characteristics varied depending on whether the court 
served adults or juveniles.

* Juvenile problem-solving courts were smaller than adult courts. 
In 2012, nearly three-quarters of juvenile drug and mental health 
courts had fewer than 20 active participants, compared to roughly 
a third of adult drug and mental health courts.

* Individual counseling services were used in the majority of 
drug courts (94%) and mental health courts (95%), regardless of 
whether they served juveniles or adults.

* The average time in programs was less than 1 year in two thirds 
of juvenile drug courts (65%) and 1 year or more in two-thirds of 
adult drug courts (69%).

* A significantly higher proportion of juvenile mental health 
courts (59%) tracked program graduates than adult mental health 
courts (41%).

Drug and mental health courts for juveniles were
smaller than those for adults
***************************************************

The differences in size among adult and juvenile drug and mental 
health courts were significant. Juvenile courts tended to be 
smaller than adult courts. In 2012, 41% of juvenile drug courts 
had a capacity of 19 or fewer participants, compared to 10% of 
adult drug courts (table 9). Conversely, a higher proportion of 
adult drug courts (50%) had a capacity of 50 or more participants 
than juvenile drug courts (11%).

Results were similar for mental health courts. Nearly half (48%) 
of juvenile mental health courts had a capacity of 19 or fewer 
participants, compared to 16% of adult mental health courts. 
Three percent of juvenile mental health courts had a capacity of 
50 or more, and none had a capacity of 100 or more. In 
comparison, 23% of adult mental health courts had a capacity of 
50 or more, and 16% had a capacity of 100 or more.

The difference in the number of active participants was also 
significant. Nearly three-quarters of juvenile drug courts (74%) 
and juvenile mental health courts (71%) had fewer than 20 active 
participants in 2012, compared to about a quarter (28%) of adult 
drug courts and about a third (34%) of adult mental health 
courts. The findings for admissions and exits were similar 
(appendix table 7).

Almost all drug and mental health courts (99%) operated at or 
below capacity (not shown). A majority of juvenile drug courts 
(65%) operated below capacity. Slightly less than half of adult 
drug courts (48%), adult mental health courts (44%), and juvenile 
mental health courts (44%) were below capacity.

******************************************************
Individual counseling was commonly used by
participants in nearly all adult and juvenile 
drug and mental health courts
*******************************************************

Some services were offered by drug and mental health courts 
equally for adult and juvenile participants. Individual 
counseling services were the most common and were used in the 
vast majority of drug courts (94%) and mental health courts (95%) 
for both juveniles and adults (appendix table 9). 

For most services, the proportion of courts offering these services 
differed significantly between those serving adults and those 
serving juveniles. Services more common for adult drug courts 
included assistance in locating housing (56% of adult compared to 
15% of juvenile drug courts), assistance in accessing benefits 
(48% compared to 26%), job training or assistance (65% compared 
to 41%), and use of medication to treat addiction (27% compared 
to 11%). In mental health courts, these services were also more 
commonly used by adults than juveniles. Conversely, cognitive 
behavioral therapy was used in a significantly higher percentage 
of juvenile mental health courts (81%) than adult mental health
courts (72%).

*****************************************************
Most juvenile problem-solving courts accepted cases
after sentencing or release
******************************************************

Juvenile problem-solving courts intervened at different points in 
the life cycle of cases than adult problem-solving courts. Most 
adult drug (80%) and mental health (74%) courts accepted cases 
after a plea was entered but prior to sentencing (appendix table 
11). Significantly more juvenile drug (59%) and mental health 
(68%) courts accepted cases after sentencing or upon release than 
adult drug (39%) or mental health (38%) courts.

*******************************************************
Juveniles spent less time in programs than adults
*******************************************************

Juveniles spent significantly less time in problem-solving court 
programs than adults. The average time in programs was less than 
1 year in about two-thirds of juvenile drug courts (65%) and 
juvenile mental health courts (70%), compared to about a third of 
adult drug courts (31%) and nearly half of adult mental health 
courts (49%).

***************************************************
Case dismissal was the most common benefit for
program graduates
***************************************************

The most common benefit of successful completion of a problem-
solving court program was case dismissal. Nearly two-thirds of 
all drug courts (65%) and about three-quarters of all mental 
health courts (74%) could dismiss the case when the program was 
completed successfully. About half of adult drug courts (47%) and 
adult mental health courts (51%) could suspend sentences, which 
was significantly higher than the proportion of juvenile drug 
courts (31%) and juvenile mental health courts (26%) that offered 
this benefit to graduates. In comparison, a significantly greater 
percentage of juvenile drug courts could expunge records upon 
successful completion (32%), compared to adult drug courts (25%).

*********************************************************
Most juvenile mental health courts tracked participants
after program completion
*********************************************************

Nearly 6 in 10 juvenile mental health courts (59%) tracked 
program graduates. This was significantly greater than the 
proportion of adult mental health courts (41%) that tracked 
graduates. About half of adult drug courts (52%) and juvenile 
drug courts (48%) tracked participants after program completion.
*************************************************************

**************************************
Funding of problem-solving courts
**************************************

Most problem-solving courts were funded 
by state grants or through the state 
budget in 2012
*********************************************

Problem-solving courts reported the percentage of their total 
budgets that came from different sources. Fewer than a quarter 
(23%) of these courts operating in 2012 reported that they 
received some federal grants to support their programs. Four 
percent reported that the court was entirely funded with federal 
grants (table 10). Sixty percent reported receiving funding from 
the state (grants or budget), and 23% reported that the court was 
entirely funded by the state. Twenty percent of problem-solving 
courts reported that up to 50% of their funding came from court 
fees or fines. (See appendix table 1.)

************************************
Exits from problem-solving courts
************************************

57% of all problem-solving courts reported 
that more than half of the exits in 2012 
were successful program completions
***********************************************

More than half (57%) of problem-solving courts reported that
51% of exits were successful program completions (table 11).
Two-thirds (66%) of hybrid DWI/drug courts reported that
51% of exits were successful program completions in 2012.
In comparison, 62% of family problem-solving courts had
50% or fewer exits by successful program completions.
Tribal wellness (26%) and veterans courts (22%) reported that no 
participants successfully completed the court program. Veterans 
courts estimates were based on a low response rate to the 
question and must be interpreted with caution. Of the veterans 
courts that reported no successful program completions, 42% were 
instituted in 2012. Of the tribal wellness courts that reported 
no successful program completions, 33% (2 courts) were pilot 
programs (not shown). It is possible that the participants 
admitted had not yet met the requirements of the program by the 
end of 2012.

In 2012, most (93%) problem-solving courts reported at least one 
benefit to participants for successful program completion.
Sixty-one percent of these courts reported case dismissal and
40% reported a suspended sentence as a benefit (table 12).
Eighty percent of veterans, 78% of tribal wellness, 75% of youth 
specialty, and 74% of mental health courts reported case 
dismissal as a benefit for successful program completion.
Twenty-two percent of courts reported that a benefit of 
successful program completion was that the record was expunged. 
Eleven percent of courts reported that a benefit of successful 
program completion was an expedited settlement of the case. 33% 
of family problem-solving courts reported this benefit.

Fifty-one percent of domestic violence courts reported that the 
case was dismissed. In 2012, 50% of DWI courts reported that a 
suspended sentence was a benefit of successful completion of 
court. For veterans courts, 78% reported that case dismissal and 
64% reported that a suspended sentence were benefits of 
successful completion of the court program.

A majority of family problem-solving courts (58%) reported other 
benefits of successful completion. Some form of family 
reunification was the most commonly (50%) reported other benefit 
for successfully completing family problem-solving courts in 2012 
(not shown). Forty-five percent of domestic violence courts 
reported other benefits of successful completion. Fifty percent 
of DWI courts reported other benefits of successful completion. 
Of these, the most commonly reported other benefit was partial or 
full driving privileges restored (12%) (not shown).

In 2012, less than half (44%) of all problem-solving courts 
reported that they tracked participant progress after program 
completion (figure 4). Eleven percent of domestic violence courts 
and 59% of DWI courts tracked graduates after successful 
completion.

********************
Methodology
********************

Survey overview
******************

The Census of Problem-Solving Courts (CPSC) is the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics’ (BJS) first information collection from all 
problem-solving courts in the United States, Puerto Rico, and
Guam. The National Center for State Courts (NCSC) fielded the 
survey on behalf of BJS. The survey defined problem-solving 
courts as those that—

* used therapeutic justice to reduce recidivism

* operated within the judiciary

* had a judicial officer in charge

* had an exclusive docket

* either admitted participants, had active participants, or 
exited participants between January 1 and December 31,
2012.

The CPSC collected information about the type of court, problems 
addressed, court capacity, cases accepted, sources of funding, 
services provided, number of admissions and exits, and tracking 
of graduates. Additional information collected but not presented 
in this report included stakeholder involvement in court 
planning, staff, training, presence of a court case 
management system, program evaluation, and demographic data on 
exiting court participants. Demographic data were not provided 
for a sufficient number of participants to provide reliable 
national estimates.

Universe identification
************************

The universe list of problem-solving courts began with the
National Drug Court Institute (NDCI) directory of state problem-
solving court coordinators, which is updated every 6 months. An 
initial letter was sent to each contact, asking them to identify 
all of the problem-solving courts in their state and to provide a 
court-level contact for each program. This file was supplemented 
and verified by the Council of State Governments, Center for 
Court Innovation, National Association of Youth Courts, NCSC, and 
NDCI. The final list was further refined using information from 
court websites and press releases.

The unit of count for the CPSC is the problem-solving court.
If a single courthouse location operated multiple problem-solving 
courts, each problem-solving court was counted separately. A 
problem-solving court that sat in multiple locations was also 
counted as a single court.

The original universe list included the 50 states, the District 
of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The
Virgin Islands did not have any problem-solving courts in
2012. The U.S. territories of American Samoa and Northern
Mariana Islands were excluded by design.

Court response rate and court verification
********************************************

The survey was sent to 3,633 problem-solving courts expected to 
be operating in all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
Guam, and Puerto Rico in 2012. If a court did not respond to the 
survey, staff followed up with phone calls and emails to the 
respondent. The verification process included the type of court.
If there was no response to the phone calls or emails, and if no 
other person responsible for problem-solving courts could confirm 
the existence of the court, that court was considered to be 
unverifiable and was removed from the universe list. After 
repeated follow-up, 376 nonresponding courts could not be 
verified and were eliminated, leaving 259 verified nonresponding 
courts in the universe. After reviewing completed surveys, an 
additional 204 responding courts were excluded because they did 
not meet the criteria for inclusion.

The final universe contained 3,052 problem-solving courts, of 
which 2,793 responded for an overall 92% response rate. To 
compensate for the 259 nonresponders, all courts except drug 
courts had analytic weights calculated by first stratifying by 
court type and then weighting reporting courts so that their 
weighted counts equaled the universe count of the stratum. Due to 
their large numbers, drug courts were additionally stratified 
into three substrata by the size of population served, and 
analytic weights were calculated in a similar manner within 
population strata as was done with the other court types. This 
led to a slight underestimation of the total number of juvenile 
drug courts and a slight overestimation of the total number of 
adult drug courts because the drug court strata did not control 
for the juvenile or adult distinction, and 6% of adult drug 
courts and 7% of juvenile drug courts did not respond. These 
nonresponse adjustments and the resulting analytical weights for 
each type of court are included in appendix table 21.

Item nonresponse
******************

The CPSC included 44 questions. For responding courts, there was 
no discernible pattern to item nonresponse. If a majority of 
items was skipped, the respondent was identified as a 
nonresponder and included in the weighting scheme. Overall, the 
item nonresponse rate for each question was less than 10%, unless 
otherwise noted in the tables.

Accuracy of the estimates
*****************************

Because the CPSC was designed to be a census of problem-solving 
courts and included only verified courts, any error should come 
from failure to respond to the survey. Court-level (or unit) 
nonresponse ranged from 2% missing (driving while intoxicated 
courts) to 16% missing (youth courts). To account for unit 
nonresponse, the responses are weighted as previously discussed. 
Because such weighting may introduce some error into the 
estimates, standard errors were estimated for every table 
produced for this report. The standard error varies by estimate 
and type of court. Overall, an estimate with a small standard 
error is considered to be more reliable than an estimate with a 
large standard error. Estimates with larger standard errors are 
considered to be less precise and should be interpreted with some 
degree of caution. All standard errors were produced using SUDAAN 
Statistical Software for Analyzing Correlated Data.

Additionally, readers can use the estimates and the standard 
errors of the estimates provided in this report to generate a 
confidence interval around the estimate as a measure of the 
margin of error. The following example illustrates how standard 
errors can be used to generate confidence intervals:

According to the CPSC, in 2012, an estimated 27.0% of youth 
specialty courts reported that the court tracked successful 
graduates of the program (figure 5). The standard error of this 
estimate is 1.3 (appendix table 20). A confidence interval around 
the estimate was generated by multiplying the standard errors by 
±1.96 (the t-score of a normal, two-tailed distribution that 
excludes 2.5% at either end of the distribution). Therefore, the 
95% confidence interval around the estimate is 27.0 ± (1.3 × 
1.96) or 24.5 to 29.5. In other words, if different samples of 
problem-solving courts using the same procedures were taken from 
the U.S. population in 2012, 95.0% of the time, 24.5% to 29.5% of 
youth courts would respond that they tracked graduates. When the 
confidence intervals for the counts of other types of problem-
solving courts that tracked successful graduates do not overlap 
with the confidence interval for youth specialty courts, then 
those problem-solving courts can be said to have different 
tracking counts than youth specialty courts.
