Probation and Parole in the United States, 2015

Danielle Kaeble and Thomas P. Bonczar, BJS Statisticians

At yearend 2015, an estimated 4,650,900 adults were under 
community supervision--a decrease of 62,300 offenders from 
yearend 2014 (figure 1). ***Footnote 1 The community supervision 
population excludes parolees on probation to avoid double 
counting offenders. See table 7 and Methodology***. About 1 in 53 
adults in the United States was under community supervision at 
yearend 2015. This population includes adults on probation, 
parole, or any other post-prison supervision, with probationers 
accounting for the majority (81%) of adults under community 
supervision. (See BJS definition of probation and parole 
textbox.) 

The 1.3% decline observed in the adult community corrections 
population was due to the drop in the probation population. 
The probation population declined from an estimated 3,868,400 
offenders at yearend 2014 to 3,789,800 at yearend 2015 
(figure 2). The parole population continued to rise with a 1.5% 
increase, from 857,700 offenders at yearend 2014 to 870,500 at 
yearend 2015 (figure 3).

Data in this report were collected through the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics’ (BJS) Annual Probation Survey and Annual Parole 
Survey. Both surveys collect data from U.S. probation and parole 
agencies on yearend counts, movements (i.e., entries and exits), 
offender characteristics, and outcomes of supervision. For this 
report, an adult is any person subject to the jurisdiction of an 
adult court or correctional agency. Reporting methods for some 
probation and parole agencies have changed over time (see 
Methodology). Appendix tables 1 through 6 present additional 2015 
data by jurisdiction.

*****************************************************************
****************************************
BJS definition of probation and parole
****************************************

Probation is a court-ordered period of correctional supervision 
in the community, generally as an alternative to incarceration. 
In some cases, it can be a combined sentence of incarceration 
followed by a period of community supervision.

Parole is a period of conditional supervised release in the 
community following a prison term. It includes parolees released 
through discretionary or mandatory supervised release from 
prison, those released through other types of post-custody 
conditional supervision, and those sentenced to a term of 
supervised release.
*****************************************************************

**************************************
The decline in community supervision 
was primarily due to a decline in the 
probation population
**************************************

The community supervision population in 2015 was at its lowest 
level since 2005 (table 1). In each year between 2008 and 2015, 
declines ranged from 0.5% to 2.6%. Since 2005, the population 
under community supervision declined by 6% due to a decline in 
the probation population. 

The probation population increased from 
2005 to 2007, followed by a decline through 2015. During the same 
period, the parole population increased by 11%. With the 
exception of 2009 and 2013, each year from 2005 to 2015 saw an 
increase in the number of individuals supervised on parole. This 
increase had little effect on the total community supervision 
population. The probation population continued to be over four 
times the size of the population of individuals on parole.

**************************************
The rate of adults under community 
supervision fell to 1,886 per 100,000 
U.S. adult residents
**************************************

The rate of adults under community supervision declined from 
1,911 offenders per 100,000 U.S. adult residents at yearend 2014 
to 1,886 per 100,000 at yearend 2015. This was consistent with 
the decline in the number of adults under community supervision 
(table 2). The rate of adults on probation declined from 1,568 
offenders per 100,000 U.S. adult residents at yearend 2014 to 
1,522 at yearend 2015. The parole rate increased for the first 
time since 2012, from 348 offenders per 100,000 U.S. adult 
residents in 2014 to 350 in 2015. This was similar to the rate of 
parolees observed in 2005 (351 per 100,000).

**************************************
Probation entries and exits each 
decreased by more than 4% in 2015
**************************************

Movements onto (entries) and off (exits) probation declined by 4% 
between 2014 and 2015. Prior to this decline, a slight increase 
was observed in 2013 in both entries and exits. Probation entries 
started to decrease and exits remained stable in 2014. Exits from 
probation continued to exceed entries to probation for the 
seventh consecutive year. 

Between 2014 and 2015, probation entries declined 5%, from an 
estimated 2,065,800 entries to 1,966,100 (figure 4). During the 
same period, exits declined by 4% from an estimated 2,129,100 
exits to 2,043,200. The declines in both entries and exits led to 
an overall decline in movements onto and off probation, from 
4,194,900 in 2014 to 4,009,300 in 2015. (See Methodology for a 
discussion of estimating change in population counts.)

**************************************
The exit rate for probationers was 
consistent with rates observed in 2005
**************************************

The rate at which probationers exit supervision (the number that 
exit probation divided by the average of the probation population 
at the beginning and end of the year) provides a measure of how 
quickly the population turns over. Since 2005, the rate of exits 
from probation has remained consistent, ranging from 52 to 55 per 
100 probationers. In 2015, the exit rate mirrored 2005 at 53 per 
100 probationers (table 3).

The completion rate (turnover due to completing the term of 
supervision either through a full-term completion or early 
discharge) was 33 exits per 100 probationers during 2015, which 
was similar to the rate observed in 2005 (32 per 100). This was 
down from rates that had been consistent since 2009 (35 to 36 per 
100).

**************************************
Probation population characteristics 
remained relatively unchanged during 
the last decade
**************************************

At yearend 2015, 25% of probationers were female, compared to 23% 
in 2005 (table 4). Similarly, the racial composition of 
probationers at yearend 2015 was unchanged from 2005. In both 
2015 and 2005, more than half (55%) of probationers were non-
Hispanic white, 30% were non-Hispanic black, and 13% were 
Hispanic or Latino.

More than half of probationers were supervised for a felony 
offense over the entire 2005 to 2015 period, exceeding those 
supervised for a misdemeanor (49% or lower). At least 7 in 10 
probationers were on active status, or those regularly required 
to contact a probation authority, since at least 2005.

**************************************
U.S. parole population increased 
1.5% in 2015
**************************************

The parole population increased in 2015 for the second 
consecutive year and for the seventh time in 10 years. At yearend 
2015, an estimated 870,500 offenders were on parole, up from 
857,700 at yearend 2014. Both the state (up 7,600 parolees) and 
the federal system (up 5,200 parolees) contributed to this 
increase.

Between 2014 and 2015, entries to parole increased from an 
estimated 461,100 to 475,200 (up 14,100), and exits from parole 
rose from 452,800 to 463,700 (up 10,900) (figure 5). Parole 
entries increased for the first year since 2008, and exits 
increased for the first year since 2009. Entries continued to 
exceed exits for the sixth consecutive year. Overall movements 
onto and off parole increased from 913,900 in 2014 to 938,900 in 
2015. Even after the increase, combined movements onto and off 
parole were still about 9% lower than the 1,036,300 observed in 
2005.

**************************************
The parole exit rate increased after 
five consecutive annual decreases
**************************************

The parole exit rate increased to 54 exits per 100 parolees in 
2015, halting a downward trend first observed in 2011 (table 5). 
The exit rate, due to completion of a supervised term or early 
discharge, was 33 exits per 100 parolees in 2014 and has remained 
between 35 and 32 exits per 100 parolees since 2008. In 2015, the 
rate of return to incarceration remained unchanged from 2013 and 
2014 (14 exits per 100 parolees), but declined overall from 25 
per 100 in 2005.

**************************************
Parolees being supervised for drug 
offenses decreased 6 percentage points 
since 2005
**************************************

Parolees being supervised for drug offenses decreased from 37% in 
2005 to 31% in 2015, while the percentage of individuals being 
supervised for violent crimes increased from 26% to 32% during 
the same period (table 6). In 2015, 4% of parolees were 
supervised for weapons crimes, which was the same as in 2014. 
Approximately 44% of parolees were white, compared to black (38%) 
and Hispanic (16%) parolees. Males made up 87% of the adult 
parole population, which was similar to the rates in 2014 and 
2005 (88% each). More than 8 in 10 parolees were on active 
supervision over the entire 2005 to 2015 period.

***************
Methodology
***************

The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) Annual Probation Survey 
and Annual Parole Survey, which began in 1980, collects data from 
U.S. probation and parole agencies that supervise adults. This 
data collection defines adults as persons subject to the 
jurisdiction of an adult court or correctional agency. Juveniles 
sentenced as adults in a criminal court are considered adults. 
Juveniles under the jurisdiction of a juvenile court or 
correctional agency are excluded from these data. The National 
Criminal Justice Information and Statistics; Service of the Law
Enforcement Assistance Administration, BJS’s predecessor agency, 
began a statistical series on parole in 1976 and on probation in 
1979.

The two surveys collect data on the number of adults supervised 
in the community on January 1 and December 31 each year, the 
number of entries and exits to supervision during the reporting 
year, and characteristics of the population at yearend. See 
appendix tables for detailed data. Both surveys cover all 50 
states, the District of Columbia, and the federal system. BJS 
depends on the voluntary participation of state central reporters 
and separate state, county, and court agencies for these data.

During 2015, RTI International served as BJS’s collection agent 
for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data for the 
federal system were provided directly to BJS from the Office of 
Probation and Pretrial Services, Administrative Office of the 
United States Courts, through the Federal Justice Statistics 
Program.

***********
Probation
***********

The 2015 Annual Probation Survey was sent to 460 agencies, one 
less agency than the 2014 population frame as the result of a 
Michigan local probation agency closure in 2014. Following the 
opening of one probation agency in Florida and the closure of 
another in Ohio during 2015, there were a total of 460 agencies 
on the population frame for the 2015 Annual Probation Survey. The 
460 respondents included 35 central state agencies; 425 separate 
state, county, or court agencies, including the state probation 
agency in Georgia (which also provided data received from local 
public and private probation agencies in Georgia), Pennsylvania 
(which also provided data for its 65 counties), the District of 
Columbia; and the federal system. States with multiple agencies 
included Alabama (3), Colorado (8), Florida (42), Georgia (2), 
Idaho (2), Kentucky (3), Michigan (130), Missouri (2), Montana 
(4), New Mexico (2), Ohio (185), Oklahoma (3), Pennsylvania (2), 
Tennessee (3), and Washington (32). Of the 460 agencies in the 
population frame, 1 locality in Colorado, 6 in Florida, 17 in 
Michigan, 15 in Ohio, and 5 in Washington did not provide data 
for the 2015 collection. The state agency in Alaska provided 
information on the total number on community supervision, but was 
unable to report separately for those on probation. Oregon was 
unable to provide data for 2015 because of computer system 
issues. At the request of the Oregon respondent, the December 31, 
2014, population count was used as an estimate for January 1, 
2015, and December 31, 2015. Estimates for December 31, 2015, 
have been included in national and “all state” totals. (See 
Explanatory Notes for more information.)

**********
Parole
**********

The 2015 Annual Parole Survey was sent to 53 agencies: 50 central 
state reporters, which included the state parole agency in 
Pennsylvania (which also provided data for its 65 counties), the 
District of Columbia, and the federal system. In this report, 
federal parole includes a term of supervised release from prison, 
mandatory release, parole, military parole, and special parole. A 
federal judge orders a term of supervised release at the time of 
sentencing, and it is served after release from a federal prison 
sentence. Definitional differences exist between parole reported 
here and in other BJS statistical series. The state agency in 
Alaska provided information on the total number on community 
supervision, but was unable to report separately for those on 
parole. The state agency in Oregon was unable to report data in 
2015. (See Parole: Explanatory Notes for more information.)
Additional information about the data collection instruments
is available on the BJS website (http://www.bjs.gov/index.
cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=271).

**************************************
Adjustments to account for offenders 
with dual community correctional status
**************************************

Some offenders on probation or parole may have had dual community 
correctional statuses because they were serving separate 
probation and parole sentences concurrently. With the 2007 data, 
BJS began collecting information on the number of parolees who 
were also on probation at yearend. To avoid double counting, the 
total community supervision populations from 2008 through 2015 
reported in figure 1 (and the 2015 counts in appendix table 1) 
have been adjusted based on available information by excluding 
the total number of parolees who were also on probation. As a 
result, the probation and parole counts from 2008 through 2015 do 
not sum to the total community supervision population within the 
same year.

All of the estimates for parolees with dual community 
correctional statuses were based on data reported by parole 
agencies that were able to provide the information for the 
reporting year (table 7). Some probation and parole agencies were 
not able to provide these data. Therefore, the total number of 
parolees also on probation from 2008 through 2015 may be 
underestimated, which may result in overestimations in the total 
population under community supervision.

**************************************
Reporting changes in the number of 
adults on probation and parole, 
2000–2015
**************************************

In each collection year, respondents are asked to provide both 
the January 1 and December 31 population counts. At times, the 
January 1 count may differ from the December 31 count of the 
prior year. The difference reported may have resulted from 
administrative changes, such as--

* implementing new information systems, leading to data review 
and cleanup

* reconciling probationer records

* reclassifying offenders, including those on probation to parole 
and offenders on dual community supervision statuses

* including certain probation populations not previously reported 
(e.g., supervised for an offense of driving while intoxicated or 
under the influence, some probationers who had absconded, and 
some on an inactive status). 

The discrepancy between the yearend 2014 and the beginning year 
2015 probation counts resulted in an increase of 9,749 probationers 
(table 8). The discrepancy between the yearend and beginning year 
parole population count resulted in an increase of 172 parolees 
from December 31, 2014, to January 1, 2015 (table 9).

**************************************
Estimating change in population counts
**************************************

Technically, the change in the probation and parole populations 
from the beginning of the year to the end of the year should 
equal the difference between entries and exits during the year. 
However, those numbers may not be equal. Some probation and 
parole information systems track the number of cases that enter 
and exit community supervision, not the number of offenders. This 
means that entries and exits may include case counts as opposed 
to counts of individuals, while the beginning and yearend 
population counts represent individuals. Some individuals are 
being supervised for more than one charge or case simultaneously. 
Additionally, all of the data on entries and exits may not have 
been logged into the information systems, or the information 
systems may not have fully processed all of the data before the 
data were submitted to BJS.

At the national level, 11,312 probationers were the difference 
between the change in the probation population measured by the 
difference between January 1 and December 31, 2015, populations 
and the difference between probation Entries and exits during 
2015. For parole, 1,168 parolees were the difference between the 
change in the parole population measured by the difference 
between January 1 and December 31, 2015, populations and the 
difference between parole entries and exits during 2015.

Estimates of annual change reported in appendix tables 1, 2, and 
4 were calculated as the difference between the January 1 and 
December 31 populations within the reporting year. 

As previously discussed, jurisdiction counts reported for 
January 1 may differ from the December 31 counts reported in the 
previous year. As a result, the direction of change based on 
yearend data could be in the opposite direction of the 
within-year change.

In figures 1-3, change was calculated as the difference between 
the December 31 populations for each year. The method of 
reporting annual change used in this report was based on between-
year differences in the December 31 populations and differs from 
how change was reported in prior years’ reports. Annual change in 
prior reports was calculated as the difference between the 
January 1 and December 31 populations within the reporting year.

**************************************
Imputing for nonreporting agencies 
during 2015
**************************************

BJS used the methods described below to impute missing probation 
and parole data for key items, including the January 1, 2015, 
population, entries, exits, and the December 31, 2015, 
population.

Imputing the probation January 1, 2015, population
***************************************************

When the January 1, 2015, probation population was missing, the 
December 31, 2014, probation population value was carried over. 
This method was used to estimate the January 1, 2015, probation 
population in nonreporting counties and district agencies in 
Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, and Washington.

Imputing the December 31, 2015, probation population
*****************************************************

When the December 31, 2015, probation population was missing 
along with either the total entries or total exits, the missing 
value was imputed by estimating the net difference between the 
December 31, 2015, population and the January 1, 2015, population 
based on the ratio of the 2014 net difference between the 
December 31, 2014, population and the January 1, 2014, population 
to the January 1, 2014, population, and then adding the estimated 
difference to the January 1, 2015, population. This method was 
used to estimate the December 31, 2015, probation population in 
nonreporting counties and district agencies in Alabama, Colorado, 
Florida, Michigan, Ohio, and Washington.

Imputing probation entries
****************************

Based on the availability of data, BJS used three methods of 
ratio estimation to impute probation entries for agencies not 
reporting these data. The first method was used to estimate 
entries for probation agencies that were unable to report these 
data in 2015 but did report in 2014. BJS estimated probation 
entries in 2015 by using the ratio of entries in 2014 to the 
agency’s probation population on January 1, 2014, and applying 
that ratio to the agency’s January 1, 2015, population. This 
method was used to estimate probation entries in nonreporting 
counties and district agencies in Alaska, Florida, Illinois, 
Michigan, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.

The second method was used to estimate 2015 probation entries for 
agencies that did not report entries both in 2014 and 2015. The 
ratio of 2014 entries to the January 1, 2014, population among 
reporting agencies of similar size within the state was used to 
estimate the number of entries for nonreporting agencies. This 
method was used to estimate probation entries and exits for 
nonreporting counties and district agencies in Alabama, Florida, 
Michigan, and Ohio.

The third method was used to estimate probation entries by using 
the ratio of 2014 imputed entries to the January 1, 2014, 
probation population and applying that ratio to the agency’s 
January 1, 2015, population. This method was used to estimate 
probation entries and exits for nonreporting agencies in 
Colorado, New Mexico, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Imputing parole entries
*************************

To estimate parole entries for parole agencies that were unable 
to report these data in 2015 but were able to report in 2014,
BJS calculated the ratio of entries in 2014 to the agency’s 
parole population on January 1, 2014, and applied that ratio to 
the agency’s January 1, 2015, population. This method was used to 
estimate parole entries in Alaska, California, Oregon, Vermont, 
and Wisconsin.

Imputing probation and parole exits
***************************************

A single method was used to estimate probation and parole exits. 
For both probation and parole, BJS added the agency’s estimated 
entries in 2015 to the agency’s population on January 1, 2015, 
and subtracted that estimate from the population on December 31, 
2015. For probation, this method was used in Alabama, Alaska, 
Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, 
Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. For parole, 
this method was used in Alaska, California, Oregon, Vermont, and 
Wisconsin.

**************************************
Community supervision outcome measures
**************************************

The percentage of probationers and the percentage of parolees who 
completed supervision are defined as the number of probationers 
or parolees who completed supervision during the year and were 
discharged, among all probationers or parolees who were 
discharged from supervision during the year. The formula used to 
calculate this outcome measure is C(t)/D(t), where D(t) = C(t) + 
I(t) + O(t). In this formula, t equals the year referenced, C(t) 
equals the number of probationers or parolees who were discharged 
from supervision during the year after completing their terms or 
who received an early discharge, and D(t) equals the total number 
who were discharged from supervision during the year. D(t) 
includes C(t), the number of offenders who completed supervision; 
I(t), the number who were incarcerated during the year; and O(t), 
the number who were discharged during the year for other reasons.

The percentage of probationers and the percentage of parolees 
incarcerated were calculated using the same formula, except the 
numerator is the number of probationers or parolees who were 
discharged from supervision during the year as the result of 
being incarcerated.

The rate of incarceration (for parolees, this is also referred to 
as the rate of return to incarceration or the rate of 
reincarceration) based on the at-risk probation or parole 
population is defined as the ratio of the number of probationers 
or parolees who were discharged from supervision during the year 
(because they were incarcerated for a new offense, a revocation, 
or other reasons) to the number of all probationers or parolees 
at risk of being incarcerated during the year. The at-risk 
population is the number of probationers or parolees under 
supervision at the start of the year (on January 1) plus the 
number who entered supervision during the year. This group of 
probationers or parolees could be incarcerated at any time during 
the year; therefore, they were at risk of incarceration. The 
formula used to calculate this outcome measure is I(t)/(P(t-1) + 
E(t)), where t equals the year referenced, P(t-1) equals the 
start of the year population, and E(t) equals the number of 
probationers or parolees who entered supervision during the year.

The at-risk measure of incarceration accounts for all 
probationers or parolees under supervision during the year
(i.e., probationers or parolees who were under supervision on 
January 1 plus those who entered during the year) who are the 
probationers or parolees at risk of being incarcerated. This 
measure is not limited to those who are discharged during the 
year and permits each probationer or parolee to be incarcerated 
at any time during the year.

**************************************
Changes in the Annual Parole Survey
**************************************

In 2008, the Annual Parole Survey included a new type of entry-
to-parole category—term of supervised release--to better classify 
the large majority of entries to parole reported by the federal 
system. It is a fixed period of release to the community that 
follows a fixed period of incarceration based on a determinate 
sentencing statute. Both are determined by a judge at the time of 
sentencing. Accordingly, some states began reporting term of 
supervised releases in 2008. For details about the estimating 
methods used to analyze national trends for all types of entry to

**************************************
Types of federal offenders under 
community supervision
**************************************

Since the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was enacted on
November 1, 1987, offenders sentenced to federal prison are no 
longer eligible for parole, but are required to serve a term of 
supervised release following release from prison. Those sentenced 
to prison prior to November 1, 1987, continue to be eligible for 
parole, as do persons violating laws of the District of Columbia, 
military offenders, and foreign treaty transfer offenders. 
***Footnote 2 See http://www.uscourts.gov/news/TheThirdBranch/11-
05-01/Parole_in_the_Federal_Probation_System.aspx***.

The Sentencing Reform Act also required the adoption and use of 
sentencing guidelines, which also took effect on November 1, 
1987. Many offenses for which probation had been the typical 
sentence prior to this date, particularly property and regulatory 
offenses, subsequently resulted in sentences to prison. Changes 
in how federal offenders are supervised in the community were 
first described in the BJS report Federal Offenders under 
Community Supervision, 1987-96 (NCJ 168636, BJS web, August 
1998), and updated in Federal Criminal Case Processing, 2002: 
With Trends 1982-2002, Reconciled Data (NCJ 207447, BJS web, 
January 2005).

Probation: Explanatory notes
**************************************

Alaska--Nonreporting agency in 2015--the state agency in Alaska 
provided information on the total number on community 
supervision, but was unable to separately report for those on 
probation. BJS imputed December 31, 2015, and January 1, 2015, 
data based on the distribution of probation as a part of the 
community corrections population reported on the Alaska 
Department of Corrections website and the number reported to BJS 
in prior years.

California--Reporting changes between 2014 and 2015—data are not 
comparable to those reported in previous years, which were likely 
the result of difficulties some counties encountered in reporting 
felons who were resentenced as misdemeanants, and changing from 
reporting of cases to individuals. These changes resulted in a 
decrease of 9,794 probationers on January 1, 2015 (285,681), 
compared to December 31, 2014 (295,475).

Colorado--Nonreporting agency in 2015--one local agency did not 
report data. The most recently available December 31 population 
count was used to estimate January 1, 2015, and December 31, 
2015, populations. *** Footnote *See Imputing entries and exits 
for nonreporting agencies in 2015***

Florida--Nonreporting agencies in 2015--six local agencies did 
not report data. The most recently available December 31 
population count was used to estimate January 1, 2015, and
December 31, 2015, populations. *** Footnote *See Imputing 
entries and exits for nonreporting agencies in 2015***

Georgia--Reporting changes between 2014 and 2015--the two state 
agencies that previously provided data were consolidated under a 
single new state agency, the Georgia Department of Community 
Supervision (DCS). One reporter provides counts based on 
individual level probationer information from Georgia state 
employees (probation officers) and represents 49.8% of Georgia’s 
total probation population. The other reporter provides counts 
based on summary counts submitted by independent local probation 
agencies to the DCS and represents 50.2% of Georgia’s total 
probation population. Data are not comparable to those reported 
in previous years as the result of the new agency’s use of 
slightly different methods to count probationers under direct 
supervision by the state, resulting in an increase of 10,272 
probationers on January 1, 2015 (481,339), compared to December 
31, 2014 (471,067). Probation counts may overstate the number of 
persons under probation supervision because the county data 
collection has the capacity to report probation cases and not the 
number of persons under supervision. Probationers with multiple 
sentences could potentially have one or more cases with one or 
more probation agencies in one jurisdiction or one or more 
probation agencies in different jurisdictions.

Illinois--Nonreporting agency in 2015—the state respondent in 
Illinois was only able to report the number on probation on 
January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015. *** Footnote *See 
Imputing entries and exits for nonreporting agencies in 2015***.


Michigan--Reporting changes between 2014 and 2015-- data are not 
comparable to those reported in previous years, as a result of a 
data clean-up by local agencies. These changes resulted in an 
decrease of 6,344 probationers on January 1, 2015 (174,239), 
compared to December 31, 2014 (180,583).

Nonreporting agencies in 2015--Seventeen local agencies did not 
report data. The most recently available December 31 population 
count was used to estimate January 1, 2015, and December 31, 
2015, populations. *** Footnote *See Imputing entries and exits 
for nonreporting agencies in 2015***.

New Jersey--Reporting changes between 2014 and 2015-- data are 
not comparable to those reported in previous years as a result of 
a change in methodology. This change resulted in an increase of 
21,226 probationers on January 1, 2015 (137,124), compared to 
December 31, 2014 (115,898).

Ohio--Reporting changes between 2014 and 2015-- data are not 
comparable to those reported in previous years as a result of 
data clean-up by local agencies. This change resulted in an 
increase of 2,165 probationers on January 1, 2015 (241,080), 
compared to December 31, 2014 (238,915).

Nonreporting agencies in 2015--fifteen local agencies did not 
report data. The most recently available December 31 population 
count was used to estimate January 1, 2015, and December 31, 
2015, populations. *** Footnote *See Imputing entries and exits 
for nonreporting agencies in 2015***.

Oregon--Nonreporting agency in 2015--the state agency in Oregon 
was unable to provide data for 2015 because of computer system 
issues. At the request of the respondent, the December 31, 2014 
population count was used as an estimate for January 1, 2015, and 
December 31, 2015 have been included in national and “all state” 
totals. *** Footnote *See Imputing entries and exits for 
nonreporting agencies in 2015***.

Washington--Reporting changes between 2014 and 2015-- data are 
not comparable to those reported in previous years as the result 
of a change in methodology by the state probation agency for 2014 
and 2015, and by five local agencies for 2015 (includes two local 
agencies that now include cases that were previously erroneously 
excluded). Compared to the count previously reported for December 
31, 2014 (94,112), these changes resulted in a decrease of 43 
probationers on January 1, 2015 (94,069). Compared to a revised 
count for December 31, 2014 (98,446), which includes the 
reconciled state data, these changes resulted in a decrease of 
4,377 probationers for January 1, 2015, all of which can be 
attributed to changes in reporting by local agencies.

Nonreporting agencies in 2015--five local agencies did not report 
data. The most recently available December 31 population count 
was used to estimate January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2015, 
populations. *** Footnote *See Imputing entries and exits for 
nonreporting agencies in 2015***.

Wisconsin--The state probation agency, overseeing the entirety of 
the state’s probation population, was able to report the number 
of probationers who died, but was not able to report the total 
number of exits or the number of entries to probation during 
2015. Based on information provided by Wisconsin for 2014, BJS 
imputed the total number of entries to and exits from probation 
supervision in Wisconsin for 2015. *** Footnote *See Imputing 
entries and exits for nonreporting agencies in 2015***.

Parole: Explanatory notes
**************************************

Alaska--Nonreporting agency in 2015—the state agency in Alaska 
provided information on the total number on community 
supervision, but was unable to separately report for those on 
parole. December 31, 2015, and January 1, 2015, data—based on the 
distribution of parole as a part of the community corrections 
population--was reported on the Alaska Department of Corrections 
website, and the number was reported to BJS in prior years.

California--The state agency was not able to report entries and 
exits due to a high-level data conversion project. California’s 
total parole population as reported by BJS includes 34,836 
persons on January 1, 2015, and 33,260 persons on December 31, 
2015, who were under post-release community supervision. These 
persons account for 20,921 parolees entering and 22,497 parolees 
exiting supervision during 2015. In addition, California’s total 
parole population includes 11,739 persons on January 1, 2015, and 
11,427 persons on December 31, 2015, who were under mandatory 
supervision. These persons account for 8,693 parolees entering 
and 9,005 parolees exiting supervision during 2015. Detailed 
information on the types of entries and exits were not available 
for these populations.

Illinois--Reporting changes in 2015--there was a major technology 
transition in December 2015. During the transition, some 
traditional population counts and other measures were not 
collected. Therefore, the data provided reflect November 30, 2015 
counts as an estimate for December 31, 2015. The entries and 
discharges only include 11 months of data (January 2015 through 
November 2015).

Oregon--Nonreporting agency in 2015--the state agency in Oregon 
was unable to provide data for 2015 because of computer system 
issues. At the request of the respondent, the December 31, 2014 
population count was used as an estimate for January 1, 2015, and 
December 31, 2015. Estimates for December 31, 2015 have been 
included in national and “all state” totals. *** Footnote *See 
Imputing entries and exits for nonreporting agencies in 2015***.

Washington--Reporting changes between 2014 and 2015-- data are 
not comparable to those reported in previous years as a result of 
a change in methodology. These changes resulted in an increase of 
1,046 parolees on January 1, 2015 (10,926), compared to December 
31, 2014 (9,880).

Wisconsin--The state parole agency was able to report the number 
of parolees probationers who died, but not the total number of 
exit or the number of entries to parole during 2015. Based on 
information provided by Wisconsin for 2014, BJS imputed the total 
number of entries to and exits from parole supervision in 
Wisconsin for 2015. *** Footnote *See Imputing entries and exits 
for nonreporting agencies in 2015***
