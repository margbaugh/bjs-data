---------------------------------------------------------

Asians, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders were
victims of approximately 105,000 nonfatal violent crimes
(rape, sexual assault, aggravated assault, and simple
assault) on average per year between 2002 and 2006. An
average of about 471,000 property crimes (household burglary,
motor vehicle theft, and theft) were committed against Asian,
Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander households per
year during that period. While Asians, Native Hawaiians, and
other Pacific Islanders accounted for 4% of the U.S.
population, they were victims in 2% of nonfatal violent
crimes and 3% of property crimes between 2002 and 2006. These
findings are based on data from the Bureau of Justice
Statistics' National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and
the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime
Reporting Program (UCR), Supplementary Homicide Reports.

From 2002 through 2006, comparative nonfatal violent and
property victimizations showed--

*Asians had the lowest rate of violent victimization among
all racial or ethnic groups.***Footnote 1 Throughout this
report, the terms "Asians" and "Asians, Native Hawaiians, and
other Pacific Islanders" are used interchangeably.***

*Asian males were at a slightly higher risk of violent 
victimization than Asian females.

*Among victims, Asians were more likely than non-Asians to be
violently victimized by a stranger.

*Asian households had the lowest rate of property
victimization among households of all racial or ethnic
groups.

*Property crimes against Asian households were as likely to
be reported to the police as property crimes against white,
black, or Hispanic households.

This report focuses on the victimization experiences of
Asians, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders in the
United States. It examines nonfatal and fatal violent 
victimization and property victimization. It also includes
comparisons between the victimization of Asians, Native
Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders and other racial or
ethnic groups, as well as information on victimization
trends.

From 2002 through 2006, the average annual rate of nonfatal
violent victimization against Asians was about 11 violent
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older, compared to
24 per 1,000 persons for non-Asians (table 1). Asians were
less vulnerable than non-Asians for nearly all types of
nonfatal violent crime. For simple assault, the rate among
Asians was less than half that for non-Asians. There was no
statistically significant difference between Asians and
non-Asians in their rates of robbery.

The average annual rate of property victimization among Asian
households was 115 property crimes per 1,000 households,
compared to 162 per 1,000 non-Asian households from 2002
through 2006. Asian and non-Asian households were equally
likely to experience motor vehicle theft during this period.
Asian households were half as likely as non-Asian households
to experience household burglary.

Changes to the NCVS methodology affected crime estimates in
2006

Major changes were introduced to the NCVS methodology in
2006. Due to these changes, estimates of the amounts and
rates of crime are not comparable to NCVS estimates from
previous years. For more information, see Criminal
Victimization, 2006 at:
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cvo6.pdf.

As a result, crime estimates for 2006 are not included in the
discussion of crime trends in this report. Because relative
proportions of crime experienced among various demographic
groups did not change, data for 2006 are included in the
presentation of average annual rates and percentages. 

Violent victimization rates for Asians and non-Asians
declined from 1993 to 2002 and remained stable from 2002
through 2005

During the 10-year period from 1993 through 2002, the overall
rate of nonfatal violent victimization against Asians
declined 63%, from about 26 victimizations per 1,000 persons
age 12 or older in 1993 to about 10 per 1,000 persons in 2002
(figure 1). The rate for non-Asians declined about 55% during
this period, from about 54 victimizations per 1,000 persons
to about 25 per 1,000 persons. 

Among Asians the rate of nonfatal violent victimization of
males and females declined between 1993 and 2002 (figure 2).
Between 2002 and 2005 the rate remained stable for both Asian
males and females.

---------------------------------------------------------

The Asian, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander
population

Asians refer to persons having origins in any of the original
peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian
subcontinent, including Cambodia, China, India, Japan, Korea,
Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippine Islands, Thailand, and
Vietnam. Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders refer
to persons having origins in any of the original peoples of
Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, or other Pacific Islands.

----------------------------------------------------------

From 2002 through 2006, Asians had the lowest risk of being
violently victimized among all racial or ethnic groups

From 2002 through 2006, the average annual rate of total
nonfatal violent crime against Asians was lower than that of
all other racial or ethnic groups (table 2). Asians were the
least likely of all racial or ethnic groups to experience
aggravated assault or simple assault. While Asians were as
likely as whites to be robbery victims, they were at a lower
risk than blacks or Hispanics.

Asians were least likely to experience serious violence among
all racial or ethnic groups

From 2002 through 2006, the average annual rate of serious
violent crime against Asians was about 5 serious violent
crimes per 1,000 persons aged 12 or older, the lowest rate
among all racial or ethnic groups. Serious violent
victimization consists of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
aggravated assault. It usually involves serious injury to the
victim or an offender armed with a weapon. These crimes
accounted for about 44% of all nonfatal violent crimes
against Asians from 2002 through 2006, a percentage higher
than the percentage for whites and similar to the percentages
for blacks and Hispanics. Asians had about half the risk of
serious violence as Hispanics.

Among Asians, males and youth were the most 
vulnerable to violent victimization 

Among males and females, Asians were less likely than
non-Asians to be victims of violent crime between 2002 and
2006 (table 3). Both Asian and non-Asian males experienced
higher violent victimization rates than females.

With the exception of persons age 65 or older, Asians had a
lower risk of violent crime in all age categories than
non-Asians. Among never-married persons, married persons, and
persons who were divorced or separated, Asians had lower
rates of violent crime than non-Asians. 
    
Among Asians the risk of violent crime did not vary by annual
household income or by region from 2002 through 2006 

While non-Asians living in lower income households were at a
greater risk of violence than those living in higher income
households, Asians were equally likely to be victims of
violent crime regardless of their annual household income
(table 4). In every U.S. region, Asians were less vulnerable
to violent crime than non-Asians. 

Most nonfatal violent crimes against Asians were committed by
strangers 

From 2002 through 2006, 77% of violent crimes against Asian
males and about half of violent crimes against Asian females
were committed by strangers. Among victims, Asian males and
females were more likely to experience violence committed by
a stranger than their non-Asian counterparts (table 5).
Intimate partner violence (current or former spouses,
boyfriends, or girlfriends, including same-sex relationships)
accounted for about 13% of violent victimizations against
Asian females, which was lower than the percentage found for
non-Asian females. 

Asians were as likely or less likely than other racial or
ethnic groups to be violently victimized by an offender under
the influence of alcohol or drugs

From 2002 through 2006, the percentage of Asian victims  who
faced an offender under the influence of alcohol or drugs was
somewhat lower than the percentage of American Indian victims
and similar to the percentage of other racial or ethnic
groups. About 27% of nonfatal violence against Asians
involved an offender perceived to be under the influence of
alcohol or drugs.

Among victims, Asians were as likely as blacks and Hispanics
to face an offender with a firearm 

From 2002 through 2006, about a third of violent crimes
against Asian victims involved an offender with a weapon.
Weapons included firearms, knives, and other objects used as
a weapon. Asian victims were slightly more likely than whites
and as likely as black and Hispanic victims to face an
offender with a weapon. Asian victims faced an offender with
a firearm in about 14% of violent crime against them, which
was similar to the percentage for black or Hispanic victims
and slightly higher than the percentage for white victims.

The risk of injury due to violent victimization did not
differ between Asians and non-Asians

From 2002 through 2006, Asian victims sustained an injury in
about 26% of all nonfatal violent crimes. About half of those
victims were treated for their injuries.

Violence against Asians was as likely to be reported to the
police as violence against other racial or ethnic groups

About 49% of violent crimes committed against Asians from
2002 through 2006 were reported to the police, which was
similar to the percentages reported for whites and Hispanics
(table 6). Among Asians, robbery was more likely to be
reported than simple assault and slightly more likely than
aggravated assault. About 81% of robberies against Asians
were reported, compared to 59% for whites and about 55% for
Hispanics. Aggravated assault against Asians was less likely
to be reported than aggravated assault against American
Indians. Simple assault against Asians was somewhat less
likely to be reported to the police than simple assault
against American Indians.

While accounting for 4% of the U.S. population, Asians were
about 2% of all homicide victims in 2006

Asians accounted for 340 of all homicide victims in 2006
according to the FBI's UCR.***Fotnote 2 For overall estimates
of homicides, see Homicide Trends in the United States
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/homtrnd.htm>.***
The number of murdered Asian males and females increased
between 2005 and 2006 (figure 3). Males accounted for about
74% of Asian homicide victims in 2006, compared to 73% of
white homicide victims and 85% of black homicide victims.
About 50% of all Asian homicide victims were age 30 or under,
which is similar to the percentage of white victims (48%) and
less than the percentage of black victims (62%). In single
victim and single offender homicides, about 50% of Asian
victims were murdered by someone of their race, compared to
about 78% of white victims and 92% of black victims.

Property victimization for Asian households dropped by about
68% from 1993 through 2005

The rate of property crime for Asian households decreased
from about 319 property crimes per 1,000 households in 1993
to about 102 per 1,000 households in 2005 (figure 4). During
this period, the rate of property victimization for non-Asian
households decreased 51%, from about 323 per 1,000 households
in 1993 to 157 per 1,000 households in 2005. 

Since 1993, a difference in the risk of property
victimization of Asian and non-Asian households has emerged.
Asian and non-Asian households were equally likely to
experience property crime in 1993. In 2005, non-Asian
households were more likely to experience property crime than
Asian households.

Asians had the lowest risk of household burglary and theft
among all racial or ethnic groups

From 2002 through 2006, the rate of household burglary and
theft among Asian households was the lowest of all racial or
ethnic groups (table 7). Asian households were slightly more
vulnerable to motor vehicle theft than white households and
less vulnerable than black or Hispanic households.

Asians had lower rates of household property crime than
non-Asians in all regions and at most income levels 

At almost all income levels, Asian households had lower rates
of property victimization than non-Asian households (table
8). Among households with annual household incomes between
$15,000 and $24,999, there was no    statistically
significant difference between Asian and non-Asian households
in the rate of property victimization from 2002 through 2006.
Among Asian households in the U.S., those located in the
southern and western regions had the highest rates of
property victimization. Asian households had a lower risk of
property crime than non-Asian households in every U.S.
region.

Property crimes against Asian households were as likely as
those against white, black, and Hispanic households to be
reported to the police

From 2002 through 2006, almost 2 in 5 property crimes against
Asian households were reported to the police (table 9). As
with other racial or ethnic groups, motor vehicle theft had
the highest percentage of reports to the police. About 90% of
motor vehicle thefts against Asian households were reported.

Asian and black households had similar percentages of
household burglaries reported to the police. The percentage
of thefts against Asian households that was reported to the
police was marginally higher than the percentage for American
Indian households.

Methodology

Data sources

This report presents data on violent and property crimes
against non-Hispanic Asians, Native Hawaiians, and other
Pacific Islanders age 12 or older and their households as
measured by the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).
The terms "Asians" and "Asians, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific
Islanders" are used interchangeably. These crimes include
rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, simple
assault, household burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft.
 
The NCVS gathers data on crimes against persons age 12 or
older and their households, reported and not reported to the
police, from a nationally representative sample of U.S.
households. The survey provides information about victims
(age, gender, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, income,
and educational level), offenders (gender, race, approximate
age, and victim-offender relationship), and the nature of the
crime (time and place of occurrence, use of weapons, nature
of injury, and economic consequences).

Homicide data are from the Supplementary Homicide Reports
(SHR) to the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR), which are
collected by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

From 1993 through 2006, about 2.2 million individuals age 12
or older were interviewed for the NCVS. For the overall
population and for the years measured, response rates 
varied between 84% and 93% of eligible individuals. About
135,000 persons were interviewed for the NCVS in 2006. Of
those interviewed, about 320 persons were non-       
Hispanic Asians or non-Hispanic Pacific Islanders. 

Classification by race and Hispanic origin

Because the racial categories were changed in 2003, caution
is warranted when examining race over time. Since 2003, two
questions on the NCVS obtain information on the respondent's
race and Hispanic origin: (1) whether the respondent is of
Hispanic origin, and (2) which race or races they identify
with. Respondents may choose white, black/African American,
American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian/other
Pacific Islander, and other race. Respondents who select
other race are asked to specify their race. More than one
race may be selected. 

Prior to 2003, respondents were asked to identify the racial
group they identified with, including white, black, American
Indian/Aleut/Eskimo, Asian/Pacific Islander, or other race.
Respondents who selected other race were not able to specify
a race for the NCVS. They were also not able to select more
than one racial group. After respondents were asked the
question on race, they were asked if they were of Hispanic
origin.

For nonfatal violent crime and property crime discussed in
this report, the Asian/Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander
category refers to non-Hispanics persons who either chose the
Asian/Pacific Islander category prior to 2003 or who chose
the Asian or Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander
category since 2003. Whites refer to non-Hispanic persons who
selected the white category. Black and black/African American
refer to non-Hispanic persons who chose the black category
prior to 2003 and the black/African American category
thereafter. Hispanic and Hispanic/Latino categories refer to
persons of any race who identified as being of Hispanic or
Latino ethnicity. American Indians and American Indian/Alaska
Natives refer to non-Hispanic persons who selected either the
American Indian/Aleut/Eskimo category prior to 2003 or the
American Indian/Alaska Native category since 2003. 

Respondents who reported more than one race were included in
all references to non-Asians but were excluded in the
breakdown of race and ethnic origin. Persons who reported
more than one race made up about 1% of the U.S. population in
2006.

Asian, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander households
are those for which the head of household reported these
categories. 

In this report for homicide data from the Supplementary
Homicide Reports, all racial categories include both Hispanic
and non-Hispanic persons.

Standard error computations

Comparisons of percentages and rates made in this report were
tested to determine if observed differences were 
statistically significant. Differences described as higher,
lower, or different passed a hypothesis test at the 0.05
level of statistical significance (95%-confidence level). The
tested difference was greater than twice the standard error
of that difference. For comparisons that were statistically
significant at the 0.10 level (90%-confidence level),
"somewhat," "slightly," or "marginally" is used to note the
difference.

Significance testing calculations were conducted at the
Bureau of Justice Statistics using statistical programs
developed specifically for the NCVS by the U.S. Census
Bureau. These programs take into consideration many aspects
of the complex NCVS sample design when 
calculating estimates.

Estimates based on 10 or fewer sample cases have high
relative standard errors. Care should be taken when comparing
such estimates to other estimates when both are based on 10
or fewer sample cases.
