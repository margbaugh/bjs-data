Officer Characteristics

*In 2007, 1 in 8 local police officers was a woman compared
to 1 in 13 officers in 1987. About 1 in 4 officers was a
member of a racial or ethnic minority in 2007, compared to 1
in 6 in 1987.

Officer Selection and Hiring

*From 2003 to 2007, there was an increase in the percentage
of officers employed by departments using personality
inventories (47% to 66%), written aptitude tests (74% to
82%), and physical agility tests (80% to 86%) in the
selection process.

*During 2007, about 3 in 10 local police officers worked for
a department requiring new officers to have some college
education. This was about the same proportion as in 2003.

*In 2007, local police recruits completed an average of
1,370 hours in required training. Compared to 2003, average
training requirements were up by more than 100 hours in
departments serving 250,000 or more residents.

*2007, average starting salaries for entry-level local
police officers ranged from $26,600 in the smallest
jurisdictions to $49,500 in the largest.

*Based on where officers were employed, the overall average
starting salary for new local police officers in 2007 was an
estimated $40,500. 

*Average starting salaries for sworn officers were $10,900
(38%) higher in departments with collective bargaining than
in those without it.

*A majority of departments serving 10,000 or more residents
offered tuition reimbursement and education incentive pay to
sworn personnel.

Patrol and Response

*Nearly 7 in 10 local police officers had regular duties
that included responding to calls for service, ranging from
6 in 10 officers in jurisdictions with 100,000 or more
residents to 9 in 10 officers in jurisdictions with fewer
than 10,000 residents. 

*In addition to automobile patrol, more than half (55%) of
local police departments used regularly scheduled foot
patrol, and about a third (32%) used bicycle patrol.

*In jurisdictions with fewer than 50,000 residents, the use
of foot or bicycle patrols declined from 69% of departments
in 2003 to 63% in 2007.

About 9 in 10 local police 9-1-1 systems were enhanced with
the capability of displaying a caller's name, address, and
special needs. Most could also display the phone number
(84%) and general location (62%) of wireless callers. 

Equipment

*In 2007, 75% of local police officers were employed by
departments that authorized the use of conducted energy
devices such as Tasers, compared to 47% in 2003.

*Sixty-one percent of local police departments used video
cameras in patrol cars during 2007, compared to 55% in 2003.
About 71,000 in-car cameras were in use during 2007,
compared to 49,000 used in 2003. 

*In 2007, 67% of local police officers were employed by a
department that required them to wear protective body armor
at all times while in the field, up from 59% in 2003.

*More than 90% of local police departments serving 25,000 or
more residents were using in-field computers during 2007. 

*In 2007 about 9 in 10 local police officers were employed
by a department that used in-field computers, compared to 3
in 10 officers in 1990 (figure 2). 

*From 2003 to 2007, there was an increase in the percentage
of local police officers employed by a department with
in-field computer access to vehicle records (78% to 86%),
driving records (71% to 80%), calls-for-service histories
(39% to 65%), and criminal histories (39% to 56%).

*In 2007, most local police departments serving 25,000 or
more residents used computers for crime mapping. About 3 in
4 officers worked for a department with computerized crime
mapping in 2007, compared to 3 in 5 during 2003.

*From 2003 to 2007, the percentage of local police
departments using electronic methods to transmit incident
reports from the field increased from 38% to 60%.

Community Policing

*From 2003 to 2007, the percentage of local police officers
employed by a department that trained all new recruits in
community policing increased from 73% to 81%.

efforts by partnering with citizen groups, upgrading
technology, and conducting a citizen police academy.

*An estimated 47,000 full-time local police officers were
designated as community policing officers in 2007, about
8,000 fewer than in 2003. Most of this decline occurred
among departments serving fewer than 50,000 residents. 

Task Force Participation

*About 13,400 local police officers were assigned full-time
or part-time to a multi-agency drug task force. A majority
of local police departments serving 10,000 or more residents
had officers assigned to a drug task force.
 
*About 4,600 local police officers were assigned full time
or part time to a multi-agency gang task force. Most

Emergency Preparedness

*During 2007, more than two-thirds of local police
departments serving 10,000 or more residents had a written
plan specifying actions to be taken in the event of a
terrorist attack. 

*As part of their efforts to prevent terrorist acts during
2007, a majority of local police departments serving 10,000
or more residents increased the presence of sworn officers
in critical areas.

*During 2007, about 4,000 full-time sworn personnel in local
police departments were employed in intelligence positions
with primary duties related to terrorist activities.

The LEMAS Survey

Every 3 to 4 years, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)
surveys a nationally representative sample of state and
local law enforcement agencies. The surveys are conducted as
part of the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) program.

This report presents data from the 2007 LEMAS survey
describing local police departments in terms of their
personnel, budgets, operations, policies and procedures,
computers and information systems, and equipment.
Comparisons are made with prior years where appropriate, and
as data are available.

The selected local police sample includes all departments
employing 100 or more full-time sworn personnel and a
systematic random sample of smaller agencies stratified by
size. (See Methodology for more information.) The sample was
selected from a BJS census of law enforcement agencies (see
Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, 2004,
BJS Web, 28 June 2007). Because sampling was used for
smaller agencies, some of the statistics presented in the
report are subject to sampling error. Statements of
comparison have been tested at the 95%-confidence level.
(See standard error tables in appendix.)

In order to compare departments with others serving similar
sized jurisdictions, the statistics in this report are
presented mainly by categories of population served. Because
most departments employ small numbers of officers and serve
small populations, overall agency-based percentages tend to
reflect smaller departments more than larger ones. To adjust
for this effect, additional overall percentages weighted by
the number of officers employed are presented in the text
and selected figures. (See Methodology.)

Local Police Departments

According to the 2004 BJS Census of State and Local Law
Enforcement Agencies, nearly all local police departments
were operated at the sub-county level by individual
municipal (85%) or township (13%) governments. A total of
154 were operated by tribal governments, 63 by multiple
local governments as regional or joint police departments,
and 56 by county governments.

Local police departments perform a wide range of functions.
Some of the law enforcement functions typically performed,
regardless of jurisdiction size, include first response to
criminal incidents, response to calls for service, patrol,
crime investigation, arrest of criminal suspects, execution
of warrants, traffic enforcement, traffic direction and
control, accident investigation, drug enforcement, parking
enforcement, and crime prevention education. For more
information on functions performed by local police, see
Local Police Departments, 2003, BJS Web, 1 April 2006.

Employment

As of September 2007, the estimated 12,575 local police
departments in the United States employed about 601,000
persons on a full-time basis (table 1).

Local police departments employed about 463,000 full-time
sworn personnel in 2007

About 463,000 (77% of total) local police department
employees were sworn personnel with full arrest powers.
Departments employed about 54,000 persons on a part-time
basis. Nearly half of these part-time employees were sworn
officers.

From 1987 (the first year of the LEMAS survey) to 2007, the
number of full-time local police employees increased by an
estimated 152,000 (34%) or an average of 1.7% annually
(figure 3). The number of full-time sworn officers increased
by about 108,000 (30%) during this period. The number of
full-time civilian employees increased by about 44,000 (47%)
from 94,000 to 138,000.

From 2003 to 2007, the total number of full-time local
police employees increased by about 20,300 (3.5%). During
this period, local police employment of sworn personnel
increased by about 11,400 (2.5%) and employment of civilians
rose by about 8,900 (7%). (These changes were not
statistically significant at the 95%-confidence level.)

Municipal and township police departments employed an
average of 2.3 officers per 1,000 residents 


County police departments employed an average of 1.7
full-time officers for every 1,000 residents served.

Municipal and township police departments, which comprise
98% of local police departments, employed an average of 2.3
full-time officers per 1,000 residents in 2007, down from
2.5 per 1,000 in 2003. As in 2003, departments serving
25,000 to 99,999 residents had the lowest average ratio in
2007 (1.8 per 1,000).

Half of local police departments employed fewer than 10
full-time officers

Nationwide, 624 (5% of total) local police departments
employed at least 100 sworn personnel (table 2). The New
York City Police Department was the largest, with 35,216
officers. (See appendix table 1 for a list of the 50 largest
local police departments.) Half of all departments employed
fewer than 10 officers, including 652 departments (5%) with
the equivalent of just 1 officer. 

While departments with fewer than 10 officers accounted for
50% of departments, they employed just 5% of officers. The
majority of full-time local police officers (61%) were
employed by departments with at least 100 sworn personnel,
and a third of officers were employed by departments with at
least 1,000 sworn personnel.

Three-fourths of local police departments served fewer than 
10,000 residents

A similar pattern is observed when departments are grouped
by population size. About three-fourths (73%) of departments
served fewer than 10,000 residents, but these departments
employed just 14% of all officers 
(table 3). About half (51%) of local police officers were
employed in jurisdictions with 100,000 or more residents. 

Operating Costs

Collectively, local police departments cost about $55.4
billion to operate during fiscal 2007 (table 4). This was
14% more than in 2003 after adjusting for inflation (see
Methodology). (These figures do not include capital
expenditures such as major equipment purchases or
construction projects.)

Local police departments cost $260 per resident to operate
during 2007

Compared to the overall annual operating cost per resident
of $260, departments serving a population of 1 million or
more cost nearly 50% more to operate $385 per resident.
Departments serving a population of fewer than 50,000 had
the lowest per resident cost less than $220. 

Overall, operating budgets averaged about $4.4 million per
department for 2007, ranging from about $849 million for
departments serving a population of 1 million or more, to
$263,000 for departments serving fewer than 2,500 residents.
 
Local police departments cost $116,500 per officer to
operate during 2007

When both sworn and nonsworn personnel are included, the
average annual operating budget for local police departments
was about $88,000 per employee. Operating costs ranged from
near $100,000 per employee in jurisdictions with 50,000 to
999,999 residents to $49,400 per employee in jurisdictions
with fewer than 2,500 residents.

When nonsworn personnel are excluded, local police
departments cost $116,500 per officer to operate for 2007.
Per officer costs ranged from more than $130,000 per officer
for departments serving 50,000 to 999,999 residents, to
$56,400 per officer in jurisdictions with a population under
2,500.

After controlling for inflation, per officer operating costs
for 2007 were $10,900 (10%) higher than in 2003 (figure 4).
(This difference was not statistically significant at the
95%-confidence level.) The smallest increase both in terms
of dollars and percentage  occurred in jurisdictions with
10,000 to 49,999 residents, where costs rose by $6,800 (7%).
The largest dollar increase, about $14,700, occurred in
jurisdictions with 50,000 to 249,999 residents. The largest
percentage increase, 15%, was observed in jurisdictions with
fewer than 10,000 residents.

A majority of local police departments serving 10,000 or
more residents had drug asset forfeiture receipts during
2006

During 2006, an estimated 33% of local police departments,
employing 78% of officers, supplemented their operating
budget with proceeds from a drug asset forfeiture program
(appendix table 2). Overall, departments received money,
goods, or property worth $307.5 million. Average total
receipts ranged from nearly $3 million among departments
serving 1 million or more residents to less than $40,000 for
departments serving fewer than 25,000 residents. 

Personnel

Nearly all (98%) local police departments had a minimum
education requirement for new officers (table 5). The most
common requirement (82% of departments) was a high school
diploma. 

About 3 in 10 local police officers worked for a department
that required new hires to have some college education

An estimated 16% of departments had some type of college
requirement, including 9% with a 2-year degree requirement.
In 2007 the percentage of officers employed by a department
with a college requirement for new officers (29%) was about
the same as in 2003 (33%), and about 3 times as high as in
1990 (10%).

All departments used criminal record checks, and about 99%
used background investigations and driving record checks
during the officer hiring process (appendix table 3). Credit
history checks were used by 61% of departments, including
more than 90% of those serving 25,000 or more residents. 
Nearly all departments serving 25,000 or more residents used
psychological evaluations to screen applicants for sworn
positions

Personal interviews (99%) were used almost universally by
departments in the officer hiring process (appendix table
4). Interviews were supplemented by a psychological
evaluation in 72% of departments, including more than 98% of
those serving 25,000 or more residents.

Nearly half of departments used written aptitude tests (48%)
and personality inventories (46%) to screen applicants. 
Among departments serving 25,000 or more residents, more
than 80% used written aptitude tests, and more than 60% used
personality inventories. 

Screening methods related to physical attributes were also
common (appendix table 5). Medical exams were used by 89% of
departments, including all serving 25,000 or more residents.
Drug tests were used by 83% of departments including more
than 95% of those serving 25,000 or more residents. Physical
agility tests were used by 60% of departments, including
about 90% of those serving 25,000 or more residents. 

Local police officers hired in 2007 were subjected to more
screening methods than those hired in 2003

In 2007, nearly all local police officers were employed by a
department that used criminal record checks (100%),
background investigations (99.8%), driving record checks
(99.8%), medical exams (98.3%), personal interviews (98.2%),
drug tests (95.4%), and psychological evaluations (94.8%) in
the selection process.

For each screening method included in the LEMAS survey, the
percentage of officers employed by a department using that
method remained stable or increased between 2003 and 2007
(figure 5). The largest increases were for personality
inventories (from 47% of officers in 2003 to 66% of officers
in 2007), credit history checks (70% to 83%), written
aptitude tests (74% to 82%), and physical agility tests (80%
to 86%).

In the largest jurisdictions, local police recruits were
required to complete more than 1,700 hours of training

Upon selection, new local police recruits were typically
required to complete extensive classroom and field training. 


In jurisdictions with 500,000 or more residents, average
requirements exceeded 1,700 hours compared to about 700
hours in the smallest jurisdictions (table 6). (For greater
detail on basic law enforcement training, see State and
Local Law Enforcement Training Academies, 2006, BJS Web, 26
February 2009.) Based on where officers were employed, the
average training requirement for local police recruits was
1,370 hours.

Ninety-two percent of local police departments had an annual
in-service training requirement for non-probationary
officers, including all of those serving a population of
250,000 or more. Overall, the average annual in-service
requirement was 35 hours (appendix table 6).

From 2003 to 2007, average training requirements increased
by about 100 hours in larger jurisdictions 

From 2003 to 2007 average training requirements for local
police recruits in jurisdictions with 250,000 or more
residents increased by 105 hours, from 1,543 to 1,648 hours
(figure 6). In jurisdictions with fewer than 250,000
residents, the average number of training hours required was
about the same in 2007 as in 2003.

Average starting salaries for entry-level officers were 1.2%
higher in 2007 than in 2003 after adjusting for inflation

Minimum starting salaries for entry-level local police
officers averaged $49,500 in the largest jurisdictions,
compared to $26,600 in the smallest (table 7). When weighted
by size of department, starting salaries for entry-level
officers averaged about $40,500 in 2007. This was $5,000
(14%) more than in 2003. The inflation-adjusted 4-year
increase was 1.2%. (See Methodology for information about
the calculation to adjust dollars for inflation.)

The average base starting salary for local police chiefs was
$58,200, ranging from $164,000 in jurisdictions with 1
million or more residents to $38,300 in those with a
population under 2,500. Minimum starting salaries for
first-line supervisors (sergeant or equivalent) averaged
$78,800 in jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents,
and at least $60,000 in all other population categories of
25,000 or more. 

Officer starting salaries were 38% higher in departments
with collective bargaining

The average starting salary for entry-level officers was
higher in departments with collective bargaining ($39,263)
than in those without it ($28,376). This pattern existed in
all population categories, ranging from a difference of
about $6,000 in the largest jurisdictions to $9,000 in the
smallest (figure 7).

Nationwide, 38% of local police departments, employing 66%
of all officers, authorized collective bargaining for
officers (appendix table 7). This included at least 62% of
the departments in each population category of 10,000 or
more.

About 7 in 10 local police officers worked for a department
that offered tuition reimbursement

The base salaries earned by local police officers were
sometimes supplemented by special pay and other financial
benefits (appendix table 7). For example, 37% of
departments, employing 72% of all officers, offered tuition
reimbursement to officers, and 32% of departments, employing
55% of officers, offered education incentive pay. A majority
of departments serving 10,000 or more residents offered
these two types of benefits. 

Other types of special pay offered by local police
departments included merit pay (23% of departments,
employing 31% of all officers), shift differential pay
(21%, 56%), special skills pay (16%, 36%), military service
pay (13%, 41%), hazardous duty pay (6%, 27%) and bilingual
ability pay (6%, 27%). 

----------------------------------------------------------
Workplace policies for sworn personnel
 
Local police departments typically maintained a variety of
written policies and procedures pertaining to workplace
issues during 2007. For example, all departments serving a
population of 10,000 or more had a written code of conduct
and appearance for officers (table 8). More than 95% of
these departments also had an off-duty conduct policy. 

At least 98% of the departments in each population category
of 10,000 or more had policies on off-duty employment, and
at least 70% of the departments in each of these categories
had a policy on the maximum number of work hours allowed for
officers. 

Overall, nearly all local police officers were employed by a
department with a code of conduct and appearance (99%), and
policies pertaining to off-duty employment (97%) and conduct
(97%) (figure 8). About 9 in 10 officers were employed by a
department with a policy on employee counseling (91%). About
3 in 4 officers were employed by a department with a policy
on maximum work hours (75%).
-----------------------------------------------------------

About 1 in 4 local police officers were members of a racial
or ethnic minority

In 2007, about 1 in 4 full-time local police officers were
members of a racial or ethnic minority (table 9). The
estimated 117,113 minority officers employed in 2007
represented an increase of about 10,500 (10%) over 2003.
From 2003 to 2007, minority representation among local
police officers increased from 23.6% to 25.3%. In 1987,
minorities comprised 14.6% of officers (figure 9). 

An estimated 55,267 black or African American officers were
employed by local police departments in 2007. This was about
2,400 (5%) more than in 2003. In 2007, the percentage of
officers who were black (11.9%) was about the same as in
2003 (11.7%). In 1987, blacks comprised 9.3% of officers.

From 2003 to 2007, the number of Hispanic local police
officers rose 16%

An estimated 47,678 Hispanic or Latino officers were
employed by local police departments in 2007. This was about
6,600 (16%) more than in 2003. From 2003 to 2007, the
percentage of officers who were Hispanic rose from 9.1% to
10.3%. In 1987, 4.5% of officers were Hispanic. 

In 2007, an estimated 12,564 officers were members of other
minority groups including Asians, Pacific Islanders, and
American Indians--about the same number as in 2003. These
groups comprised 2.7% of local police officers in 2007,
about the same percentage as in 2003 (2.8%), but more than
in 1987 (0.8%).

About 1 in 8 local police officers was a woman 

In 2007, about 1 in 8 full-time sworn personnel in local
police departments were women (table 10). The estimated
55,305 female officers employed in 2007 represented an
increase of about 4,300 (8%) from 2003. During this time,
female representation increased from 11.3% to 11.9%. By
comparison, women comprised 7.6% of officers in 1987. 

With the exception of Hispanic or Latino officers, changes
from 2003 to 2007 in the percentage or number of officers by
race and gender were not significant at the 95%-confidence
level.

Patrol and Response

About 2 in 3 local police officers had regularly assigned
duties that included responding to calls for service

In 2007, two-thirds of full-time local police officers had
regularly assigned duties that included responding to calls
for service (appendix table 8). The proportion of officers
assigned to respond to calls ranged from about 6 in 10 among
departments serving 100,000 or more residents, to about 9 in
10 among departments serving fewer than 10,000 residents. 

About 9 in 10 local police officers worked for a department
with an enhanced 9-1-1 system

An estimated 91% of local police departments participated in
an emergency 9-1-1 system during 2007 (table 11). At least
96% of the departments in each population category of 10,000
or more were 9-1-1 participants, including all serving
250,000 or more residents. 

About 3 in 4 departments used enhanced 9-1-1 systems,
capable of displaying information such as a caller's phone
number, address, and special needs. This included 90% or
more in each population category of 25,000 or more. In 2007,
most local police 9-1-1 systems could display the phone
number (84%) and general location (62%) of wireless callers
(appendix table 9).

An estimated 97% of local police officers worked for a
department with some type of 9-1-1 system during 2007, and
90% were employed by a department with an enhanced 9-1-1
system. Both percentages were about the same as in 2003.
 
A majority of departments serving 25,000 or more residents
had regularly scheduled foot and/or bicycle patrols

All but a few local police departments used regularly
scheduled automobile patrols during 2007. A majority (55%)
also used routine foot patrols, including about 9 in 10
departments serving a population of 1 million or more, and
about 8 in 10 departments serving a population of 250,000 to
999,999 (table 12). 

About a third (32%) of departments used regularly scheduled
bicycle patrols. A majority of departments serving 25,000 or
more residents used bicycle patrols, including all of those
serving 500,000 or more residents. 

Motorcycle patrols were the next most common type of
regularly scheduled patrol, used by about 1 in 6
departments. More than 90% of the departments serving
100,000 or more residents used motorcycle patrols on a
regular basis.

Other types of routine patrol included marine (4% of
departments), transporter (such as a Segway) (2%), horse
(1%), and air (1%). A majority of the departments serving
500,000 or more residents used marine patrol on a routine
basis, and a majority of those serving 250,000 or more
residents used horse and air patrols regularly. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
Policies and procedures pertaining to special populations or
situations 

An estimated 91% of local police departments, employing 98%
of all officers, had written policies and procedures for
dealing with domestic disputes (table 13, figure 10). 

Many departments also had written policies pertaining to
specific sub-groups of the community. Most common were
policies on dealing with juveniles (90% of departments,
employing 98% of officers). Many departments also had
policies on dealing with mentally ill persons (69% employing
89%). About a third of departments, employing just over half
of all officers, had policies on dealing with homeless
persons (34% employing 51%) and persons with limited
English-speaking ability (32% employing 58%). 

An estimated 67% of departments, employing 85% of officers,
had a written racial profiling policy. Nearly all
departments serving 250,000 or more residents and about 8 in
10 departments serving 25,000 to 249,999 residents had such
a policy.
------------------------------------------------------------

From 2003 to 2007, use of foot and bicycle patrols declined
in jurisdictions with fewer than 50,000 residents
A smaller percentage of departments used regularly scheduled
foot or bicycle patrols in 2007 (63%) than in 2003 (69%).
The percentage of local police officers employed by a
department using these types of patrol declined slightly,
from 86% to 83%. 

The overall decline from 2003 to 2007 in the number of
departments using foot or bike patrol can be attributed
primarily to departments serving fewer than 50,000
residents: in jurisdictions with 10,000 to 49,999 residents,
the percentage using foot or bike patrol dropped from 72% to
64%, and in jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000 residents,
the percentage dropped from 67% to 61% (figure 11). The
percentage of departments using foot or bike patrol remained
about the same in jurisdictions with 50,000 or more
residents.

Equipment

All local police departments authorized semiautomatics as a
primary sidearm for patrol officers during 2007. Twenty-two
percent of departments authorized revolvers as a primary
sidearm (appendix table 10).

Pepper spray and batons were authorized by nearly all local
police departments

Nearly all departments authorized officers to use one or
more types of less-than-lethal weapons during 2007. Most
commonly authorized was pepper spray (97% of departments,
employing 98% of all officers) (table 14). 

Batons were authorized by 93% of departments, employing 98%
of all officers. Collapsible batons (88%) were authorized by
more departments than traditional (45%) or PR-24 (36%)
batons (appendix table 11). An estimated 92% of officers
worked for a department authorizing collapsible batons,
compared to 53% for traditional batons and 38% for PR-24
batons. 

An estimated 60% of departments, employing 75% of officers,
authorized conducted energy devices (CEDs), such as Tasers
or stun guns. At least two-thirds of the departments in each
population category of 10,000 or more authorized CEDs.

An estimated 28% of departments, employing 44% of all
officers, authorized the use of soft projectiles (appendix
table 12). This included a majority of the departments
serving a population of 25,000 or more. Fifteen percent of
departments, employing 23% of all officers, authorized the
use of neck restraints or holds.

An estimated 75% of local police officers worked for a
department that authorized CEDs in 2007, compared to 47% in
2003 

Previous LEMAS surveys recorded substantial increases in the
number of local police departments authorizing the use of
pepper spray from 1990 to 2003. In 1990, 72% of officers
were employed by a department that authorized its use. By
2003, nearly all officers worked for a department
authorizing it. This remained true in 2007. 

----------------------------------------------------------
Use-of-force policies and procedures

Nearly all local police departments had written policies
pertaining to the use of lethal (97%) and less-than-lethal
(96%) force by their officers (table 15). Just 0.2% of local
police officers, all in small jurisdictions, were employed
by a department without a written deadly force policy, and
0.7% by a department without a written policy on
less-than-lethal force (figure 12). 

When citizens filed complaints about use of force, 31% of
departments required that the complaint be reviewed outside
the chain of command of the involved officer(s). Most
departments serving 250,000 or more residents had this
requirement, and 55% of all officers worked for a department
with such a policy.

Overall, 8% of departments, employing 33% of officers, had a
citizen complaint review board (CCRB) in their jurisdiction
that examined use-of-force complaints. 

A majority of departments serving 500,000 or more residents
had a CCRB. About 4% of departments, employing 21% of
officers, were served by an independent CCRB possessing full
investigative authority with subpoena powers. 
------------------------------------------------------------

A more recent trend in less-than-lethal weapons has been an
increasing number of departments authorizing the use of
conducted energy devices. In 2007, 60% of local police
departments authorized these types of weapons, up from 23%
in 2003 and 7% in 2000. In 2007, 75% of officers worked for
a department that authorized CEDs, compared to 47% in 2003
and 24% in 2000. 

From 2003 to 2007, large increases in the use of CEDs
occurred in all population categories (figure 13). Among
departments serving 250,000 or more residents, the
percentage authorizing CEDs increased from 54% to 89%;
50,000 to 249,999 residents, from 47% to 77%; 10,000 to
49,999 residents, from 34% to 68%; and under 10,000
residents, from 18% to 56%. 

About 2 in 3 local police departments required officers to
wear protective armor at all times while in the field 

In 2007, 75% of local police departments required field
officers to wear protective body armor at least some of the
time while on duty (table 16). Sixty-five percent of
departments required field officers to wear armor at all
times.

An estimated 80% of local police officers were employed by a
department with some type of armor requirement in 2007,
compared to 74% in 2003 and 30% in 1990 (figure 14). The
percentage of officers employed by a department with an
armor requirement for all field officers in all
circumstances, was 67% in 2007, compared to 59% in 2003 and
25% in 1990.

Local police departments operated about 60 cars per 100
officers 

During 2007, local police departments collectively operated
an estimated 286,000 cars, or 60 cars per 100 officers
(table 17). About a third (34%) of local police cars were
unmarked (appendix table 13). A majority (60%) of
departments also used other 4-wheel motorized vehicles such
as sport utility vehicles, trucks, and vans. This included
all departments serving 25,000 or more residents. Eighteen
percent of departments used motorcycles, including all
serving a population of 100,000 or more.

In 2007, 50% of departments, employing 51% of all officers,
allowed sworn personnel to take marked vehicles home for
commuting purposes (appendix table 14). Overall, 19% of
departments, employing 27% of officers, allowed vehicles to
be used for personal errands.

A majority of local police departments serving 250,000 or
more residents operated at least one helicopter 

An estimated 6% of departments, employing 39% of officers,
operated at least one boat during 2007 (table 18). This
included a majority of those serving 500,000 or more
residents. Nationwide, local police operated an estimated
1,350 boats.

One percent of departments, employing 34% of all officers,
used helicopters. A majority of departments serving 250,000
or more residents used helicopters. An estimated 312 local
police helicopters were in use nationwide in 2007.

Fewer than 1% of local police departments, employing 8% of
all officers, operated airplanes, with 40 in use nationwide.
More than a third (38%) of departments serving 1 million or
more residents operated at least 1 airplane. For more
information on the use of airplanes and helicopters by local
police, see Aviation Units in Large Law Enforcement
Agencies, 2007, BJS Web, 9 July 2009. 

Local police departments used about 8,000 dogs and 1,200
horses for law enforcement purposes during 2007

Twenty-nine percent of local police departments, employing
77% of all officers, used dogs for law enforcement
activities during 2007 (table 19). This included all
departments serving 250,000 or more residents, and a
majority of those serving 10,000 to 249,999 residents.
Overall, about 8,000 dogs were involved in the activities of
local police departments in 2007.

About 1% of departments, employing 34% of all officers, used
horses for law enforcement purposes, including a majority of
those serving 250,000 or more residents. Local police
departments collectively maintained nearly 1,200 horses
during 2007.

Most departments serving 500,000 or more residents used
fixed-site surveillance cameras 

An estimated 66% of local police departments, employing 74%
of all officers, used video cameras on a regular basis
during 2007 (table 20). Thirteen percent of departments used
video cameras for fixed-site surveillance, including a
majority of those serving a population of 500,000 or more.
Among departments using such cameras, the average number in
use ranged from 3 in the smallest jurisdictions to more than
200 in the largest. 

Nine percent of departments used video cameras for mobile
surveillance, including a majority of those serving 1
million or more residents. Among departments using cameras
for this purpose, the average number of cameras in use
ranged from 2 in departments serving fewer than 100,000
residents to 26 in those serving a population of 500,000 or
more.

About 3 in 5 local police departments used video cameras in
patrol cars

Video cameras were most commonly used in patrol cars. An
estimated 61% of departments used in-car cameras in 2007
compared to 55% in 2003. The estimated 71,000 in-car cameras
in use during 2007 was about 22,000 (45%) more than in 2003.
By population category, the average number in use ranged
from 3 in the smallest jurisdictions to more than 200 in
jurisdictions with 500,000 to 999,999 residents.

From 2003 to 2007, the percentage of departments using
in-car cameras increased in all population categories: from
46% to 51% among departments serving 250,000 or more
residents, 54% to 60% among departments serving 50,000 to
249,999 residents, 61% to 64% among departments serving
10,000 to 49,999 residents, and from 54% to 61% among
departments serving fewer than 10,000 residents (figure 15). 

Computers and Information Systems

Local police departments used computers for a wide variety
of functions during 2007.

More than 90% of departments serving 25,000 or more
residents used computers for dispatch
Local police departments' uses of computers included general
records management (79%), and maintaining personnel records
(53%) (table 21). Computers were also used by some
departments for fleet management (27%), and resource
allocation (20%) purposes.

Computers also helped many departments support operational
functions such as crime investigation (60%), dispatch (49%),
and booking (32%). 

For each general or operational function included in the
LEMAS survey, more officers were employed by a department
using computers to perform that function during 2007 than
2003: records management (91%, 80%), dispatch (86%, 72%),
crime investigation (85%, 71%), personnel records (77%,
64%), information sharing (76%, 53%), fleet management (68%,
52%), automated booking (61%, 48%), and resource allocation
(57%, 36%).

More than 90% of departments serving 25,000 or more
residents had access to an Automated Fingerprint
Identification System (AFIS)

Seventy percent of local police departments, employing 91%
of officers, had access to an Automated Fingerprint
Identification System (AFIS) that included a file of
digitized prints compared to 62% and 88% in 2003 (appendix
table 15). Eleven percent of departments, employing 46% of
all officers, had exclusive or shared ownership of an AFIS
system in 2007. This included a majority of the departments
serving 100,000 or more residents. 

A majority of departments serving 25,000 or more residents
used computers for crime analysis and crime mapping

A majority of departments serving 25,000 or more residents
used computers in an analytic capacity related to
intelligence gathering, crime analysis, analyzing community
problems, and crime mapping (table 22). 

Overall, 40% of departments used computers for intelligence
gathering and 38% for crime analysis. About a fourth of
departments used computers for the analysis of community
problems (28%) and crime mapping (27%).

Thirteen percent of departments, including more than half of
those serving a population of 50,000 or more, used computers
to identify crime hotspots during 2007.

As with general and operational computer functions, more
officers worked for a department using computers for
analytic functions in 2007 than in 2003: crime analysis (80%
in 2007, 67% in 2003), crime mapping (75% in 2007, 57% in
2003), intelligence gathering (72% in 2007, 46% in 2003),
analysis of community problems (64% in 2007, 52% in 2003),
hotspot identification (58% in 2007, 45% in 2003).

More than 90% of departments serving 25,000 or more
residents used in-field computers

A majority of the local police departments in each
population category of 2,500 or more were using in-field
computers or terminals during 2007, including more than 90%
of those serving a population of 25,000 or more (table 23).
Overall, 59% of departments, employing 89% of all officers,
used in-field computers or terminals. Nationwide,
departments using in-field computers operated about 37 for
every 100 sworn officers. (See appendix table 16 for types
of in-field computers used.)

About half (52%) of departments used in-field computers or
terminals for writing field reports during 2007, and about a
third (35%) used them for communications (table 24). A
majority of the departments serving 10,000 or more residents
used in-field computers for these purposes.

Departments using in-field computers to produce field
reports employed 65% of all officers in 2007, compared to
34% in 2003, and those using computers for communications
purposes employed 72% of officers in 2007, compared to 49%
in 2003. 

Most local police officers were employed by a department
providing them with in-field computer access to vehicle,
driving, calls-for-service, and criminal records

In 2007 about half of local police departments provided
officers with in-field computer access to vehicle records
(52%), driving records (48%), and warrants (48%) (table 25).
This included more than 80% of the departments in each
population category of 25,000 or more. Departments using
in-field computers for these purposes employed 89% of all
officers. 

In about a third of departments, in-field computers or
terminals could be used to access calls-for-service (34%)
and criminal history (32%) records. The third included a
majority of the departments serving 25,000 or more
residents. Departments with in-field access to
calls-for-service records employed 73% of officers, and
those with access to criminal histories employed 63%.

Local police officers were about 3 times as likely to work
for a department using in-field computers in 2007 (89%) as
in 1990 (30%)

The percentage of local police departments using in-field
computers or terminals in 2007 (59%) was slightly more than
in 2003 (56%) and about 12 times greater than in 1990 (5%).
Likewise, the 89% of local police officers working for a
department with in-field computers or terminals in 2007 was
slightly higher than in 2003 (83%) and about 3 times the
percentage reported in 1990 (30%).

From 2003 to 2007, slight increases in local police use of
in-field computers and terminals occurred in most population
categories (figure 16). In-field computer use among
departments serving 250,000 or more residents increased from
98% to 99%. In departments serving 50,000 to 249,999
residents, use increased from 94% to 97%; in departments
serving 10,000 to 49,999 residents, use increased from 81%
to 82%; and in departments serving fewer than 10,000
residents, use increased from 46% to 50%.

The percentage of local police officers employed by a
department providing in-field computer access to critical
information has also been on the increase since 1997 when
LEMAS first began tracking this capability. In 2007,
departments providing patrol officers with in-field computer
access to vehicle records employed 86% of all officers in
2007, compared to 78% in 2003 (figure 17). 

Other types of information and the percentage of officers
employed by a department providing in-field access during
2007 and 2003 are as follows: driving records 80% in 2007,
71% in 2003; calls-for-service records 65% in 2007, 39% in
2003; criminal history records 56% in 2007; 39% in 2003.

From 2003 to 2007, the percentage of departments using
electronic methods to transmit criminal incident reports to
headquarters increased from 38% to 60%

In 2007, 60% of local police departments primarily used
computers and data devices for transmitting criminal
incident reports from the field to their central information
system (table 26). Paper reports were used by 36% of
departments, and 4% used voice transmission methods such as
a telephone or radio.

Continuing a trend observed in past LEMAS surveys, the 36%
of departments using paper reports to transmit criminal
incidents represented a decrease from 2003, when 55% used
this method. During the same period, use of computer and
data devices increased from 38% to 60%. 

From 2003 to 2007 an increase in the use of electronic
(non-paper) methods of report transmission was observed in
all population categories (figure 18). Among departments
serving 250,000 or more residents, 53% used electronic
methods in 2007 compared to 33% in 2003. The percentage of
departments in other population categories using electronic
methods in 2007 and 2003 respectively, are as follows:
50,000 to 249,999 residents 61% in 2007, 36% in 2003; 10,000
to 49,999 residents 70% in 2007, 54% in 2003; under 10,000
residents 57% in 2007, 43% in 2003.

Community Policing

Balancing responsiveness to calls for service with proactive
problem solving is a primary goal of effective community
policing. The community policing approach requires that
police and citizens join together to identify and address
underlying causes of crime and disorder. 

The Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented
Policing Services (COPS) defines three major components: (1)
collaborative police-community partnerships; (2) support
from agency management, structure, personnel, and
information systems; and (3) a problem-solving process that
develops and rigorously evaluates effective responses. For
more information on community policing, see the COPS Office
website at <www.cops.usdoj.gov>.

The LEMAS survey began tracking community policing
personnel, activities, and policies in 1997, in response to
COPS funding programs that were impacting local law
enforcement agencies. (See Community Policing in Local
Police Departments, 1997 and 1999, BJS Web, 25 February
2001.) 

About half of local police officers worked in a department
with a written community policing plan

A local police department's commitment to community policing
can be measured to some extent at the management level by
the presence of written objectives and policies. For
example, 53% of departments, employing 81% of officers, had
an agency mission statement that included a community
policing component in 2007 (table 27), compared to 47% of
departments employing 73% of officers in 2003. 

A commitment to community policing may be more evident in
departments with a formal, written community policing plan.
In 2007, 16% of departments, employing 48% of officers, had
such a plan. This included about two-thirds of those serving
250,000 or more residents and nearly half of those serving
50,000 to 249,999 residents. In 2003, 14% of departments,
employing 44% of officers, had a written community policing
plan.

Nearly half of officers worked in a department that screened
recruits for analytical problem-solving ability


Some departments assessed applicants' suitability for
community policing activities during the selection and
hiring process. For example, 29% of departments, employing
46% of all officers, screened applicants for analytical
problem-solving ability (appendix table 17). This included a
majority of departments serving a population of 250,000 or
more.
 
Most local police departments serving 10,000 or more
residents trained all new recruits in community policing
 
The practice of training at least some new recruits in
community policing skills such as problem-solving and
developing community partnerships increased to 56% of
departments employing 83% of officers in 2007, up from 39%
and 72% in 2003 (table 28). In 2007, 44% of departments,
employing 70% of all officers, trained all new recruits in
community policing, compared to 31% and 67% in 2003.

Most departments serving 50,000 or more residents actively
encouraged officers to participate in problem-solving
projects

More than 80% of departments serving a population of 50,000
or more and a majority of the departments serving 10,000 to
49,999 residents used geographic assignments for patrol
officers (table 29). About 60% of the departments serving
50,000 or more residents also actively encouraged officers
to become involved in community problem solving projects.
    
More than 4 in 5 departments serving 50,000 or more
residents partnered with citizen groups during 2007

Local police departments engaged in various community
policing activities during 2007. For example, 38% of
departments, employing 75% of officers, partnered with
citizen groups to elicit feedback for developing community
policing strategies (table 30). This included a majority of
departments serving a population of 10,000 or more, and at
least 80% of the departments in each population category of
50,000 or more.

An estimated 25% of departments, employing 57% of officers,
upgraded technology during 2007 to support the analysis of
community problems. This included a majority of departments
serving a population of 50,000 or more.

Fifteen percent of departments, employing 60% of all
officers, conducted a citizen police academy during 2007.
This included a majority of departments serving a population
of 50,000 or more, and at least 80% of the departments in
each population category of 100,000 or more.

Fifteen percent of local police departments, employing 35%
of all officers, surveyed citizens in their jurisdiction on
topics related to crime, fear of crime, or satisfaction with
police services. This included 65% of the departments
serving 250,000 to 999,999 residents.

A majority of departments serving a population of 50,000 or
more had a full-time community policing unit 

In 2007, 14% of local police departments had a separate
specialized unit with full-time officers dedicated to
community policing activities (table 31). This included 85%
of departments serving 1 million or more residents, and
about 60% of those serving a population of 50,000 to
999,999.

About 47,000 local police officers were specifically
designated to perform community policing activities 

Although not necessarily part of a separate specialized
unit, many local police officers were specifically
designated as community policing officers in order to engage
in community policing activities during 2007. In 2007,
nearly half (47%) of local police departments reported using
community policing officers.

Collectively, local police departments had about 47,000
full-time community policing officers. More than two-thirds
of the departments in each population category of 25,000 or
more used full-time community policing officers. Departments
serving 500,000 or more residents had well over 100
community policing officers each, on average. 

The number of community policing officers in local police
departments declined by 54% from 2000 to 2007

Despite increases in the number of new officer recruits
receiving community policing training between 2003 and 2007,
the LEMAS survey recorded downward trends in the number of
local police departments using community policing officers
and the total number of officers so designated during that
period.

From 2000 to 2003, the number of community policing officers
declined by almost half from about 103,000 to about 55,000.
The percentage of departments using community policing
officers also declined from 66% to 58%. From 2003 to 2007,
the downward trend continued, dropping to 47% of departments
and 47,000 officers.

These declines are in sharp contrast to the period from 1997
to 2000 when the LEMAS survey recorded a large increase in
the use of community policing officers from 34% of
departments and 16,000 officers in 1997, to 66% of
departments and 103,000 officers in 2000 (text table 2).

------------------------------------------------------------
Local police officers serving as school resource officers
Many local police departments, through cooperative
agreements, assign some of their sworn personnel to work in
local schools. Often these school resource officers (SROs)
employ a community policing approach and work in
collaboration with school and community-based organizations.
The core duties of SROs include law-related education,
counseling, and law enforcement. Their multi-faceted role in
the unique environment of a school requires training beyond
that typically encompassed by a basic recruit program.
In 2007, an estimated 38% of local police departments,
employing 76% of all officers, had full-time sworn personnel
assigned as school resource officers (table 32). More than
two-thirds of the departments in each population category of
10,000 or more deployed school resource officers, including
nearly 90% of those in jurisdictions with 25,000 to 499,999
residents. 

The average number of school resource officers deployed
ranged from 87 for departments serving 1 million or more
residents, to 2 among those serving fewer than 25,000
residents. An estimated 13,056 full-time local police
officers were serving as school resource officers in 2007.
This was nearly 1,300 fewer than in 2003, but still 3,700
more than in 1997, the first year the number was tracked in
the LEMAS survey. Additional school resource officers were
deployed nationwide by sheriffs' offices, state law
enforcement agencies, and school police departments.
-----------------------------------------------------------

From 2003 to 2007 the use of community policing officers
declined among departments serving fewer than 50,000
residents 

From 2000 to 2003, a decline in the use of community
policing officers by local police departments was observed
in all population categories. While use in jurisdictions
under 50,000 in population declined again from 2003 to 2007,
this trend did not continue in jurisdictions with 50,000 or
more residents. Among departments serving 250,000 or more
residents, more were using community policing officers in
2007 (98%) than in 2003 (89%) or 2000 (92%) (figure 19).
Although down from the peak year of 2000 (93%), departments
serving 50,000 to 249,999 residents were as likely to use
community policing officers in 2007 (89%) as in 2003 (88%).

Among departments serving 10,000 to 49,999 residents, 56%
were using community policing officers in 2007, down from
67% in 2003 and 75% in 2000. Among departments serving fewer
than 10,000 residents, 40% were using community policing
officers in 2007 compared to 54% in 2003 and 62% in 2000.

Task Force Participation

While community policing emphasizes law enforcement
personnel working closely with citizens, multi-agency task
force participation involves working closely with other law
enforcement agencies. Such task forces allow the partnering
of local, state, and federal agencies to combat problems
that may be of regional or even national scope. Task forces
allow agencies to pool resources and share information and
expertise across jurisdictional boundaries. 

About 8,500 local police officers were assigned full time to
a drug task force 

In 2007, 35% of local police departments, employing 77% of
officers, had at least 1 officer assigned to a multi-agency
drug task force (table 33). This included a majority of
departments serving 10,000 or more residents. About 1 in 4
departments had at least one officer assigned full time,
including a majority of those serving a population of 25,000
or more. Nationwide, more than 13,000 local police officers
were assigned to a drug task force, including about 8,500
assigned full time. 

About 2,200 local police officers were assigned full time to
a gang task force

In 2007, 12% of local police departments, employing 52% of
officers, had at least one officer assigned to a gang task
force, including a majority of departments serving 100,000
or more residents (table 34). Five percent of departments
had at least 1 officer assigned full time to a gang task
force, including a majority of those serving a population of
250,000 or more. Nationwide, about 4,600 local police
officers were assigned to a gang task force, including about
2,200 assigned full time. 

About 700 local police officers were assigned full time or
part time to a human trafficking task force 

About 2% of departments had officers assigned to a human
trafficking task force, including 54% of those serving a
population of 1 million or more (table 35). Overall, about
700 local police officers were assigned to human trafficking
task forces during 2007, and about a fifth of these were
assigned full time.

Most departments serving 100,000 or more residents had
officers assigned to an anti-terrorism task force

Nine percent of local police departments had officers
assigned to an anti-terrorism task force, including nearly
90% of those serving a population of 250,000 or more, and
54% of those serving 100,000 to 249,999 residents (table
36). Nationwide, about 2,700 local police officers were
assigned to anti-terrorism task forces, and more than 1,100
of these were assigned full time. 

Emergency Preparedness

Just over half (54%) of local police departments had a
written plan that specified actions to be taken in the event
of a terrorist attack (text table 3). All departments
serving a population of 1 million or more had such a plan, 
as did about 9 in 10 departments serving 100,000 to 999,999
residents. Departments with a terrorism response plan
employed 81% of all officers.

In addition to participating in anti-terrorism task forces,
local police departments engaged in a variety of other
activities during 2007 as part of their emergency
preparedness and homeland security responsibilities. For
example, 62% of departments participated in emergency
preparedness exercises, including more than 90% of those
serving 50,000 or more residents (table 37).
 
More than a third (36%) of departments increased the
presence of sworn officers at critical areas. This included
more than three-fourths of those serving 250,000 or more
residents, and more than half of those serving 10,000 to
249,999 residents. 
About 1 in 3 departments disseminated information to
increase citizen preparedness during 2007, and 1 in 4
departments held community meetings on homeland security
issues. About 3 in 4 departments serving a population of
250,000 or more engaged in these two activities.
 
Overall, 13% of departments partnered with culturally
diverse populations, including about two-thirds of
departments serving a population of 250,000 or more. Just 4%
of departments conducted a public anti-fear campaign during
2007, although nearly half (46%) of those serving a
population of 1 million or more did so. 

About 6 in 7 local police officers worked for a department
that participated in emergency preparedness exercises

A majority of local police officers were employed by a
department that participated in emergency preparedness
exercises (86%), increased the presence of sworn personnel
at critical areas (65%), disseminated information to
increase citizen preparedness (62%), and held community
meetings on homeland security and preparedness issues (52%)
(figure 20). 

A quick, effective emergency response involving multiple
first responder agencies in an affected region is essential.
The use of a shared radio network infrastructure allows
interoperability an important factor in achieving an
effective, coordinated emergency response.

As of 2007, about 7 in 8 local police departments were able
to use a radio network that achieved interoperability, and
at least 77% of the departments in any population category
had this capability (text table 4).

Local police departments had about 4,000 sworn personnel
serving in intelligence positions related to combating
terrorism

More than 90% of local police departments serving a
population of 500,000 or more had full-time sworn personnel
serving in intelligence positions with primary duties
related to terrorist activities (appendix table 18). A
majority of departments serving 100,000 to 499,999 residents
also had such personnel. Overall, 11% of departments had
sworn personnel serving in this capacity with a total of
about 4,000 nationwide.

Just 1% of all departments had nonsworn intelligence
personnel with primary duties related to terrorism, although
nearly half (46%) of the departments serving a population of
1 million or more did. Nationwide, an estimated 238 civilian
personnel from local police departments served in this type
of position. 

Methodology

Sample design 

Based on employment data from the 2004 BJS Census of State
and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA), the original
2007 LEMAS survey sample included 3,224 state and local law
enforcement agencies. The sample was designed to be
representative of all general purpose state and local law
enforcement agencies in the United States, with separate
samples drawn for local police departments and sheriffs'
offices. Agencies serving special jurisdictions (such as
schools, airports, or parks) or with special enforcement
responsibilities (such hunting and fishing laws or alcohol
laws) were considered out of scope for the survey. 

Sheriffs' offices without primary law enforcement
jurisdiction were also considered out of scope for the
survey. In addition, some smaller local police departments
were determined to have closed since the 2004 CSLLEA and
were dropped from the sample. After all out-of-scope and
closed agencies were dropped, the final sample size for the
survey was 3,095.

The final sample included 950 self-representing (SR)
agencies with 100 or more sworn personnel, and 2,145
nonself-representing (NSR) agencies employing fewer than 100
sworn personnel.
 
The SR agencies included 591 local police departments, 310
sheriffs' offices, and 49 state law enforcement agencies.
All 950 SR agencies received the 49-item CJ-44L
questionnaire.

The NSR local police agencies were selected using a
stratified random sample with cells based on the number of
sworn personnel. The NSR sheriffs' offices were selected
using a simple random sample. Overall, the NSR sample
included 1,504 local police departments and 641 sheriffs'
offices. All 2,145 NSR agencies received the 40-item CJ-44S
questionnaire.

Agency response rate 

A total of 2,840 agencies completed their LEMAS
questionnaire for an overall response rate of 91.8%. This
included 879 SR agencies (92.5%) and 1,961 NSR agencies
(91.4%). The response rate for local police departments was
93.9%; for sheriffs' offices it was 87.0%; and for state law
enforcement agencies it was 91.8%. The final database
includes full responses from 1,968 local police departments,
827 sheriffs' offices, and 45 state agencies. An additional
21 local police departments and 14 sheriffs' offices
completed the first page of the questionnaire as part of a
final non-response follow-up effort.

Weighting

The base weight for all SR agencies is one. For NSR
sheriffs' offices, the base weight is 4.22. For NSR local
police departments, the base weights are determined by the
number of sworn personnel employed as reported in the 2004
BJS Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies. The
final weight associated with every agency, both SR and NSR,
is the product of the base weight, a factor that adjusted
for changes in the universe since 2004, and a factor that
adjusted for any nonresponding agencies in each cell. For
state law enforcement agencies, the final weight is 1.09.
For SR sheriffs' offices it is 1.12, and for NSR sheriffs'
offices it is 4.90. 

The final weight for all SR local police departments is
1.06. For NSR local police departments with 63 to 99
officers, the final weight is 2.22, with 40 to 62 officers,
3.54; with 24 to 39 officers, 5.21; with 14 to 23 officers,
7.55; with 7 to 13 officers, 10.97; and for departments with
fewer than 7 officers the final weight is 20.29.

To compute the officer-based percentages in the report, the
final weight for an agency was multiplied by the proportion
of all full-time equivalent sworn officers employed by that
agency. The number of full-time equivalent sworn officers
was defined as the sum of the number of full-time sworn
officers and one-half the number of part-time sworn
officers.

Item non-response

For the 1,968 local police departments completing one of the
two versions of the LEMAS questionnaire, item non-response
rates due to omission or invalid data were quite low. For
most categorical items, the non-response rate was 0%
(appendix table 19).

Imputations    

When an agency did not supply a response to a numeric item,
median value imputation or ratio imputation was used. The
median value imputations used the median value of an item
reported in the 2007 survey by other agencies in the same
sample cell. The ratio imputations used the median value of
a ratio reported in the 2007 survey by other agencies in the
same sample cell. Imputations were not used for categorical
items.

For race and gender data, a cold-deck imputation process was
used where the percentages represented in an agency's sworn
personnel totals by each racial/ethnic or gender group in
the 2003 LEMAS survey was applied to the 2007 sworn
personnel totals. If 2003 data were not available, then a
ratio imputation method was used.

Accuracy of the estimates

The accuracy of the estimates presented in this report
depends on two types of error: sampling and nonsampling.
Sampling error is the variation that may occur by chance
because a sample rather than a complete enumeration of the
population was conducted. Nonsampling error can be
attributed to many sources such as the inability to obtain
information about all cases in the sample, inability to
obtain complete and correct information from the
administrative records, and processing errors. In any survey
the full extent of the nonsampling error is never known.

The sampling error, as measured by an estimated standard
error, varies by the size of the estimate and the size of
the base population. Estimates of the standard errors have
been calculated for the 2007 survey (appendix table 20).

These estimates may be used to construct confidence
intervals around percentages in this report. For example,
the 95%-confidence interval around the percentage of local
police departments using foot patrol is approximately 55%
plus or minus 1.96 times 1.5% (or 52% to 58%).
These standard errors may also be used to test the
significance of the difference between two sample statistics
by pooling the standard errors of the two sample estimates.
For example, the standard error of the difference between
departments serving fewer than 2,500 residents and those
serving 2,500 to 9,999 residents for enhanced 9-1-1 would be
3.5% (or the square root of the sum of the squared standard
errors for each group). The 95%-confidence interval around
the difference would be 1.96 times 3.5% (or 6.9%). Since the
difference of 10% (75% minus 65%) is greater than 6.9%, the
difference would be considered statistically significant.

Standard error estimates may also be used to construct
confidence intervals around numeric variables such as
personnel counts (appendix table 21). For example, the
95%-confidence interval around the number of full-time sworn
personnel is approximately 463,147 plus or minus 1.96 times
10,265, or 443,028 to 483,266.

Abbreviated form responses

In the final phase of the data collection, all remaining
non-respondents were given the opportunity to complete an
abbreviated questionnaire consisting of the first page of
the original survey form they received. A total of 21 local
police departments (5 SR and 16 NSR) and 14 sheriffs'
offices (0 SR and 14 NSR) completed the abbreviated form.
For analysis of the data that includes these partial-form
responses, slightly different weights must be used. 

The adjusted partial-form weight for all SR local police
departments is 1.05. For NSR agencies with 63 to 99
officers, the partial form weight is 20.04; with 40 to 62
officers, 3.49; with 24 to 39 officers, 5.15; with 14 to 23
officers, 7.48; with 7 to 13 officers, 10.80; and for
departments with fewer than 7 officers, the partial-form
weight is 20.04. For NSR sheriffs' offices the adjusted
partial-form weight is 4.78. 

Dollar amounts adjusted for inflation

For comparison purposes salary and budget data for 2003 were
converted into 2007 dollars. This conversion was
accomplished using Consumer Price Index data published by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
