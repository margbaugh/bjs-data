*  Duties for Federal officers included
criminal investigation (41%), police
response and patrol (19%), corrections
(18%), noncriminal investigation and

and Secret Service (13%).  
 
*  Twenty-one States and the District of
Columbia had more than 1,000 full-time
Federal officers.  Texas (12,225) and
California (12,074) had the largest
number.  New Hampshire (84) and
Delaware (104) had the fewest.

officers per 100,000 residents.  Outside
the District of Columbia, which had 1,397
per 100,000, State ratios ranged from 76
per 100,000 in Arizona to 7 per 100,000 in
Iowa and New Hampshire.

officers in 2000.  Minority representation
was 30.5% in 2000, up from 29.2% in
1998.  Hispanic or Latino officers
comprised 15.2% of officers in 2000, and
African American or black officers, 11.7%.
-------------------------------------------------------

As of June 2000, Federal agencies
employed more than 88,000 full-time
personnel authorized to make arrests and
carry firearms, according to a survey
conducted by the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS).  Compared with June
1998, employment of such personnel
increased by about 5%. 
 
The BJS count of Federal law
enforcement officers includes personnel
with Federal arrest authority who were
also authorized (but not necessarily
required) to carry firearms in the
performance of their official duties.  
Nearly all Federal officers are armed while 
on duty; Federal Bureau of Prisons
correctional officers are the largest group
who do not carry firearms during normal
duty. 

All counts include both nonsupervisory
and supervisory personnel.  They exclude
officers in the U.S. Armed Forces and
those serving in U.S. Territories or foreign
countries.  Federal agencies reported
employing about 1,200 officers in U.S.
Territories as of June 2000.  Data on
Federal officers stationed in foreign 
countries were not obtained. 

The 69 agencies included in the survey
employed about 72,000 additional full-time
support personnel and had a combined
annual budget for fiscal 2000 of
approximately $18 billion.

In response to the BJS survey, Federal
agencies classified their personnel with
arrest and firearm authority into one of 
six categories according to their primary 
area of duty. The largest number, about
36,000, performed duties related to
criminal investigation and enforcement
(41%).

The next largest categories were police
response and patrol with about 17,000
officers (19%), and corrections with
about 16,000 (18%).  About 12,000
Federal officers performed duties related
to noncriminal investigation and
inspection (13%).  Smaller numbers
performed duties related to court
operations (4%), or security and
protection (3%).    

Major employers of Federal officers

Department of Justice agencies

Four of the five largest employers of
Federal officers were within the 
Department of Justice.  The largest
employer of Federal officers with arrest
and firearm authority, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS), had
17,654 such personnel in the United
States as of June 2000.  The INS
enforcement operations budget for fiscal
2000 was about $2.8 billion.

About half of INS officers worked for the
U.S. Border Patrol.  These 8,819 officers
accounted for 53% of officers in the
police response and patrol category. 
The Border Patrol, the mobile uniformed
branch of the INS, is responsible for the
detection and prevention of smuggling
and illegal entry of aliens into the
country, with primary responsibility
between the ports of entry.  Border
Patrol officers work along, and in the
vicinity of, the 8,000 miles of U.S.
boundaries. 

The Border Patrol is one of two Border
Management Units within the INS.  The
other is the Inspections Branch, which
employed 4,062 immigration inspectors
with arrest and firearm authority at ports
of entry.  These officers were all
classified under the noncriminal
investigation and inspection category.

The INS operates three Interior
Enforcement Units -- the Investigations,
Intelligence, and Deportation and
Detention Divisions.  These Divisions
employed 2,255 criminal investigators and
immigration agents responsible for
investigating crimes under INS jurisdiction, 
and 2,518 officers performing corrections-
related duties related to detention and 
deportation.

As of June 2000, the Federal Bureau of
Prisons (BOP), was the second largest
employer of Federal officers, with 13,557
correctional officers maintaining the
security of BOP institutions and the
124,000 inmates in custody.  BOP
correctional officers comprised 84% of
the Federal officers in the corrections
category.  Their daily duties include
supervision of inmates, conducting
searches for contraband, and responding 
to emergencies and disturbances.
***Footnote 1: The BJS survey limited the
BOP count to full-time correctional officers,
and others with direct responsibility for 
dealing with inmates such as correctional
counselors and captains.  BOP provides
most of its other employees with arrest
and firearm authority so that they can 
respond to emergencies and disturbances 
as needed.***  BOP reported a fiscal 2000 
budget of approximately $3.1 billion.  

The third largest Justice Department
employer of Federal officers was the
FBI, which had 11,523 full-time
personnel with arrest and firearm
authority.  Nearly all were FBI special
agents, responsible for criminal
investigation and enforcement.  The FBI,
with a fiscal 2000 budget of $3.3 billion,
has investigative jurisdiction over more
than 200 categories of Federal crimes
including bank fraud, embezzlement,
kidnaping, and civil rights violations.  
It also has concurrent jurisdiction with 
the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)
over drug offenses under the Controlled
Substances Act. 

The DEA, the fourth largest Justice
Department employer of Federal
officers, had 4,161 employees
authorized to make arrests and carry
firearms as of June 2000.  DEA special
agents investigate major narcotics
violators, enforce regulations governing
the manufacture and dispensing of
controlled substances, and perform
other functions to prevent and control
drug trafficking.  DEA's fiscal 2000
budget was about $1.3 billion.  

The other major employer within the
Justice Department, the U.S. Marshals
Service, employed 2,735 officers with
arrest and firearm authority.  The
Marshals Service receives all persons
arrested by Federal agencies and is
responsible for their custody and
transportation until sentencing.  With
BOP assistance it also transfers
sentenced Federal inmates between
facilities.
 
The Marshals Service also has jurisdiction
over Federal fugitive matters concerning
escaped prisoners, probation and parole
violators, persons under DEA warrants,
and defendants released on bond.  The
Marshals Service makes 55% of all
arrests of Federal fugitives.

Other responsibilities include managing
the Federal Witness Security and Federal
Asset Seizure and Forfeiture Programs,
and providing security for Federal judicial
facilities and personnel. The Marshals
Service, with a fiscal 2000 budget of $570
million, is the oldest Federal law
enforcement agency, having been in
operation since 1789.

Department of the Treasury agencies

Four major employers of Federal officers
with arrest and firearm authority are in the
Treasury Department:  the U.S. Customs
Service, the U.S. Secret Service, the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
(ATF).
  
As of June 2000, the Customs Service
employed 10,522 officers with arrest and
firearm authority.  This included 7,729
inspectors and 2,779 criminal
investigators.  Customs Service officers
interdict and seize contraband entering
the United States, process persons (1.3
million daily), vehicles, and items at
more than 300 U.S. ports of entry, and
administer certain navigational laws.
   
As the Nation's primary border
interdiction agency, the Customs
Service maintains an extensive air, 
land, and marine interdiction force 
as well as an investigations component 
supported by it own intelligence branch. 
The Customs Service has investigative
responsibilities covering more than 400
laws related to customs, drugs, export
control, and revenue fraud.  Its fiscal
2000 budget was about $2.2 billion.

The second largest Treasury
Department employer was the U.S.
Secret Service which had a fiscal 2000
budget of $762 million and employed
4,039 full-time personnel with the
authority to make arrests and carry
firearms.  The total included 2,710
special agents with criminal investigation
and enforcement duties primarily related
to counterfeiting, financial crimes,
computer fraud, and threats against
dignitaries.

Most of the remainder of Secret Service
officers were in the Uniformed Division.
These officers provide protection for the
White House complex and other
Presidential offices, the Main Treasury
Building and Annex, the President and
Vice President and their immediate
families, and foreign diplomatic
missions.

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was
the third largest Treasury Department
employer of officers with arrest and
firearm authority, with 2,726 such per-
sonnel.  All were special agents within
the Criminal Investigation Division, the
law enforcement arm of the IRS charged
with enforcing the Nation's tax laws. Its
fiscal 2000 budget was about $438
million.  As of January 1999, most 
duties of the former IRS Inspections
Division were assumed by the Office of
the Treasury Inspector General for Tax
Administration. 

ATF, the fourth largest law enforcement
agency within the Department of the
Treasury, employed 1,967 officers with
arrest and firearm authority.  ATF, which
had a fiscal 2000 budget of $644 million,
is a tax-collecting, enforcement, and
regulatory arm of the Treasury
Department.  ATF enforces Federal laws
related to alcohol, tobacco, firearms,
explosives, and arson. 

----------------------------------
About 4 in 5 Federal officers with arrest
and firearm authority worked for Justice or
Treasury agencies

Nearly 50,000, or 56.2%, of Federal
officers with arrest and firearm authority
worked for agencies within the Department 
of Justice.  About 20,000, or 22.8%, were 
employed by agencies within the Department 
of the Treasury.  The only other executive 
branch department that accounted for more 
than 1% of officers was the Department of 
the Interior (4.1%). 

Overall, executive branch agencies
employed 88% of officers.  Independent
agencies (6.5%), the Federal judiciary
(4.2%), and the legislative branch (1.6%)
employed the rest.
-----------------------------------

Other agencies with 500 or more officers

The largest employers of Federal
officers with arrest and firearm authority
outside of the Justice and Treasury
Departments were the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts, the U.S. Postal
Inspection Service, and the National
Park Service. 

As of June 2000, the Federal
Corrections and Supervision Division of
the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts employed approximately 4,000
probation officers, all of whom have
arrest authority.  About 3,600 were
employed in districts where the court
authorizes officers to carry firearms
while on duty.  In 2000 the BJS survey
included all of these officers in its
counts.  About three-fourths of them are
approved to carry a firearm and were the
only officers counted in previous BJS
surveys.
  
About three-fifths of the 3,412 officers 
in the U.S. Postal Inspection Service were
Postal Inspectors, responsible for
criminal investigations covering more
than 200 Federal statutes related to the
postal system.  The others were Postal
Police officers who provide security for
postal facilities, employees, and assets,
escort high-value mail shipments, and
perform other protective functions.

The National Park Service employed
2,188 full-time personnel with arrest 
and firearm authority in June 2000. This
included 1,544 park rangers commissioned 
as law enforcement officers.  Additional 
rangers serving seasonally were also 
commissioned officers but were considered 
part-time and excluded from the BJS survey.

The Park Service total also includes 644
U.S. Park Police officers.  Although most
Park Police officers are in the Washington, 
D.C., area, they are authorized to provide 
police services for the entire National 
Park System.

The U.S. Capitol Police employed 1,199
officers to provide police services for the
U.S. Capitol grounds and buildings. In
1992, the Congress granted the U.S.
Capitol Police full law enforcement
authority in an extended jurisdiction
zone covering the area immediately
surrounding the Capitol complex. 

The Interior Department's U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service employed 888 personnel
with arrest and firearm authority.  About
three-fifths were refuge officers, with
duties related to patrol and enforcement
of Federal wildlife conservation and
environmental laws in the National
Wildlife Refuge system.  The remainder
were Special Agents responsible for
investigating violations of numerous
Federal wildlife protection laws and
treaties.

The General Services Administration 
employed 803 officers in its Federal
Protective Service.  These officers per-
form police response and patrol (71%),
security and protection (20%), and
criminal investigation (7%) duties related
to Federal buildings and property, and
the employees and visitors using them.

The State Department's Bureau of
Diplomatic Security employed 617 officers
as of June 2000.  All of these Diplomatic
Security Service officers were categorized
under security and protection because
their primary function is to protect visiting
dignitaries. The agency's Special Agents
also investigate passport and visa fraud,
and threats against foreign missions in the
U.S., foreign dignitaries, or Federal
employees.

The USDA Forest Service employed 586
officers responsible for police response
and patrol (78%), and criminal
investigation (21%) duties related to
National Forest System lands, facilities,
and users.

----------------------------------
Federal probation and pretrial
services officers
                       
The Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts (AOUSC) employs both probation 
officers and pretrial services officers.  
These officers are employees of the U.S. 
district court and are appointed by the 
judge they serve.  They are supervised 
by the chief probation officer or chief 
pretrial services officer in their district.  
As of mid-2000, the AOUSC employed about 
4,000 probation officers and 600 pretrial
services officers. 

Federal probation officers supervise
offenders placed on probation and
supervised release.  They also conduct
presentence investigations in which they
assess the risk to the community in the
form of future criminal behavior, the
harm caused by the offense, the need
for restitution, and the defendant's 
ability to pay restitution. 

Probation officers have statutory
authority to arrest supervisees for a 
violation; however, under existing policy,
they are encouraged to obtain an arrest
warrant from the court, which is
executed by the Marshals Service.

Like probation officers, Federal pretrial
services officers also have the two main
responsibilities of investigation and
supervision.  Pretrial officers investigate
defendants charged with a criminal
offense and submit reports to the court
that include recommendations for
conditional release or pretrial detention. 
Pretrial officers also supervise
defendants released to their custody and
monitor defendants' compliance with the
release conditions imposed by the court.

Pretrial officers do not have any
statutory authority to make arrests and 
therefore are excluded from the counts
in this report.  They are required to
inform the court and the U.S. attorney of
all violations which may result in the
issuance of an arrest warrant. Such
warrants are executed by the Marshals
Service.  
  
If allowed in their Federal judicial 
district, both probation officers and 
pretrial services officers may carry a 
firearm for defensive purposes while on 
duty. Before doing so, they must complete
rigorous training and certification
requirements, provide objective
justification, and be approved to do so
on an individual basis.  The following
districts do not allow any officers to 
carry a firearm in the performance of 
their official duties:

California, Central
Connecticut
Massachusetts
Tennessee, Middle
Virgin Islands
Virginia, Eastern
Wisconsin, Eastern
Wisconsin, Western
----------------------------------------

Agencies employing at least 100 but
fewer than 500 Federal officers

Federal agencies with 500 or more
officers employed about 82,000, or 93%,

survey.  Excluding offices of inspector
general, 14 additional Federal agencies
reported employing at least 100 but fewer
than 500 full-time personnel with arrest
and firearm authority.***Footnote 2: The
CIA Security Protective Service and
Federal air Marshals program of the Federal

the number of such personnel is not public 
information.***

The U. S. Mint, a bureau of the Treasury
Department, employed 354 officers within
its Police Division as of June 2000, an

of export regulations and laws.

Offices of inspector general

Twenty-eight of the 57 statutory 
Federal offices of inspector general 
(IG) employed criminal investigators 
with arrest and firearm authority in 
June 2000.  Overall, these agencies
employed about 2,700 such officers as
well as 1,854 additional personnel. 
Collectively, their 2000 budgets totaled
approximately $500 million.    

Offices of inspector general investigate
criminal violations and prevent and
detect fraud, waste, and abuse related
to Federal programs, operations, and
employees.  For links to various IG
offices' Internet homepages and a
description of their duties go to
<http://www.ignet.gov>.

As of June 2000, the Office of the
Treasury Inspector General for Tax
Administration (TIGTA) was the largest
IG employer of Federal officers with
arrest and firearm authority, with 352. 
TIGTA began operation in January
1999, in accordance with the IRS
Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998. 
The act mandated that, among other
duties, TIGTA assume most of the
responsibilities of the IRS' former
Inspection Service. 

After TIGTA, the largest IG offices 
were in the Departments of Defense (322)
and Health and Human Services (303),
followed by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) (248),
the Social Security Administration (238),
and the Department of Agriculture (217).

Overall, 24% of IG investigators with
arrest and firearm authority were
women, and 22% were members of a
racial or ethnic minority.  African
Americans or blacks (11%) comprised
the largest minority percentage followed
by Hispanics or Latinos (8%) and
Asians or Pacific Islanders (2%).

                 Percent of full-time IG
                 personnel with arrest

Among IG offices employing 50 or more
officers, the EPA (32.7%), Department
of Education (31.7%) and Department of
Agriculture (31.3%) had the highest
proportion of women.  The EPA (36.5%)
also had the largest minority percentage,
followed by HUD (30.8%) and GSA
(30.5%).

Gender and race of Federal officers

Data on gender and race were available
for 97% of Federal officers with arrest
and firearm authority.  Women
accounted for 1 in every 7, or 14.4%, of
Federal officers with arrest and firearm
authority.  Twenty-seven percent of the
officers employed by the IRS were
women, the largest proportion of any
agency with 500 or more officers.  Other
agencies where at least a sixth of the
officers were women included the
Customs Service (19.1%), the U.S.
Capitol Police (17.8%), the FBI (17.1%)

The lowest percentages of female
officers were found at the DEA (8.4%),
Federal Protective Service (8.9%),  
Secret Service (9.1%), U.S. Park Police
(9.2%), and Bureau of Diplomatic
Security (9.7%). 

About 3 in 10 Federal law enforcement

Latino officers accounted for 15.2%,
non-Hispanic blacks for 11.7%, Asians
and Pacific Islanders for 2.2%, and
American Indians for 1.2%.

Among agencies employing 500 or more
officers, the largest minority
representation was at the Federal

with arrest authority were employed in
Texas (12,225), California (12,074), the 
District of Columbia (7,991), New York
(7,183), and Florida (5,532).  These
jurisdictions accounted for 53% of the
53,227 full-time Federal officers who
primarily performed police response and
patrol or criminal investigation and
enforcement functions.

Other States with at least 2,000 Federal
officers included Arizona (3,912),
Pennsylvania (3,184), Illinois (2,713),
Virginia (2,712), New Jersey (2,274) and
Georgia (2,164).  Ten other States had

Dakota (204), and Wyoming (180).

Overall, Federal agencies employed 31
officers with arrest and firearm 
authority per 100,000 residents.  The 
District of Columbia, the location of 
many headquarters, employed the most, 
1,397 per 100,000.  States with at 
least 50 officers per 100,000 residents 
included Arizona (76), New Mexico (69), 
Texas (59), and Alaska (54).

Federal officers per 100,000 residents
performing patrol and investigative functions.  
These included Arizona (54), New Mexico 
(49), Alaska (32), Texas (34), Wyoming (32), 
Virginia (30), and Montana (25).

Three States had fewer than 10 Federal
officers per 100,000 residents:  Iowa (7),
New Hampshire (7), and Wisconsin (8). 
There were 18 States with fewer than 10
officers per 100,000 residents
performing patrol and investigative
functions.  The lowest ratio, 5 per
100,000, was found for Indiana, Iowa,
New Hampshire, and Wisconsin.

The INS employed two-thirds of its
officers in Texas (29%), California
(26%), and Arizona (12%) (table 7). 
These three States accounted for 88%
of Border Patrol officers, with 6% in 
New Mexico.  Just under 4% of Border 
Patrol officers were in the 11 States 
bordering Canada.
 
Nearly half of Bureau of Prisons 
correctional officers were employed 
in Texas (13%), Pennsylvania (9%),
California (8%), Florida (7%), New

California (12%), the District of 
Columbia (12%), and New York (11%) 
accounted for more than a third of FBI 
agents. Other major States of employment
included Texas (7%), Virginia (6%), and
Florida (5%).

The U.S. Customs Service based more
than a third of its officers in Texas 
(20%) and California (17%).  Next 
highest were Florida (12%) and New York

in both Texas (59%) and California (52%)
worked for either the Customs Service
or the INS.  

The DEA based more than half its
agents in California (14%), Texas (12%),
and Florida (10%), New York (9%), and
Virginia (8%).  Arizona and Illinois
accounted for 3% each.

The Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts reported that the largest number
of Federal probation officers employed
in Districts where they have arrest and
firearm authority were in Texas (12%),
New York (8%), Florida (8%), and
California (5%).

About 3 in 10 Postal Inspection Service
officers were employed in New York
(17%) and California (12%).  The District
of Columbia and Pennsylvania had 7%
each, followed by Texas and New Jersey 
with 6% each.

The U.S. Marshals Service had the most
officers based in New York (9%),
followed by California, Texas, and the
District of Columbia with 7% each. 
Florida (6%) and Virginia (5%) had the
next highest numbers.

About 3 in 10 IRS criminal investigators
were based in California (12%), New

highest percentages were in Florida
(7%), Georgia (5%), and Illinois (5%).

The largest number of National Park
Service (NPS) personnel with arrest and
firearm authority were in the District of
Columbia (22%) where the U.S. Park
Police employed three-fourths of its 644
officers.  Other major States of
employment for the NPS were California
(11%), New York (6%), and Arizona
(6%).    

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and
Firearms based nearly a third of its
agents in the District of Columbia (10%),
California (8%), Texas (7%), and Florida
(6%).  New York, Georgia, and Illinois
accounted for 5% each.

California and Florida each accounted
for 7% of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
personnel with arrest and firearm
authority.  Alaska and Texas were next
with 6% each.

The Federal Protective Service had
nearly a fourth of its officers in the
District of Columbia (23%), followed by
California and New York, with 9% each.

More than a fifth of U.S. Forest Service
officers were based in California (23%).
About a sixth were in Oregon (9%) or 
Montana (7%). 

Trends in employment of Federal
officers, 1996 - 2000

The number of nonmilitary Federal
officers with arrest and firearm authority
increased more than 12,000, or about
16%, from June 1996 to June 2000. 
From June 1998 to June 2000
employment of Federal officers grew
about 4,500, or 5%. 

The largest increase in number of
officers was at the INS, which went from
16,552 officers in 1998 to 17,654 officers
in 2000, an increase of 1,102 (figure 3).  Large
increases in the number of officers also
occurred at the BOP, (from 12,587 to
13,557, an increase of 970) and at the
DEA (from 3,305 to 4,161, an increase
of 856).  Other major employers with
increases included the Secret Service
(452), ATF (244), and the FBI (234).

By percentage, the largest increase in
personnel with arrest and firearm
authority was at the DEA, up 26% from
1998 to 2000.  Increases also occurred
at ATF (14%), Secret Service (13%),
BOP (8%), and INS (7%).

The IRS Criminal Investigation Division
experienced the largest decrease -- from
3,011 officers in 1998 to 2,726 in 2000,
or 8.4%.  In addition, the IRS Inspection
Service, with about 350 officers in June
1998, was eliminated.  The U.S. Postal
Inspection Service reported 78 fewer
officers, about a 2% decrease.  

Gender and race

From 1996 to 2000 the percentage of
female Federal officers with arrest and
firearm authority increased from 13.7%
to 14.4%.  During this time minority
representation rose from 27.6% to
30.5%, including a rise in the percentage
of black officers from 11.3% to 11.7%
and in Hispanic officers from 12.9% to
15.2%.

From 1996 to 2000, except for the INS,
all of the largest employers for whom
data were available reported increases
in the percentage of  female personnel
with arrest and firearm authority.  At INS
the percentage dropped from 12.7% to
11.3%.  All agencies recorded increases
in the percentage of officers who were
members of a racial or ethnic minority.  

-------------------------------------
Growth in the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, 1993-2000

In June  2000 about 1 in 5 nonmilitary
Federal officers with arrest and firearm
authority worked for the INS compared
to 1 in 7 in December 1993 (the
reference month for the first BJS census
of Federal officers).

During this time, the number of INS
officers increased more than 8,000 --
from 9,466 to 17,654. This 86% increase
far outpaced that of any other Federal
agency, including the Bureau of Prisons,
which increased its number of
correctional officers about 3,600, or
36%, during the same period. 

From December 1993 to June 2000, the
INS Border Patrol more than doubled in
size, from 3,920 officers to 8,819, an
increase of 125%.  This included an
increase of 1,005, or 13%, since June
1998. 

These increases are the result of large
staffing increases in the States
bordering Mexico where the number of
Border Patrol officers increased 140%,
from 3,460 in December 1993 to 8,292
in June 2000.  From 1998 to 2000, 1,078
officers were added, for an increase of
15%.  

Compared to 1993, the number of
employees in other branches of the INS
were also much larger in 2000.  The
number of INS investigators was 43%
higher, inspectors, 41% higher, and
detention officers, 131% higher. 
However, the number of such employees 
remained about the same from 1998 to 
2000. 

In the 11 States that border Canada, 
the number of Border Patrol agents was
about the same in June 2000 as in
December 1993, but the number of
immigration inspectors decreased 19%. 
There were increases in the number of
criminal investigators (17%) and officers
working in detention-related positions
(120%) in these States.  This resulted 
in a small increase from 1993 to 2000 in
the number of INS officers in the States
bordering Canada -- from 2,045 to 2,090
(2%); however, the year 2000 total in
these categories represented a 5%
decrease from 1998.

As a result of the large increase in INS
officers in the States that border Mexico
and only a modest increase in their
numbers in the States that border
Canada, 70% of all INS personnel with
arrest and firearm authority were based
in the southern border States in 2000,
compared to 61% in 1993.  During the
same time the percentage of INS
officers based in the northern border
States decreased from 22% to 12%.

Training for Federal officers

A majority of Federal officers receive
some or all of their training through 
the Federal Law Enforcement Training
Center (FLETC).  Among the exceptions
are special agents with the FBI and
DEA, who complete basic training at
their respective academies in Quantico,
Virginia.

FLETC, a bureau of the Treasury
Department, serves 70 Federal
agencies, as well as State, local, 
and international law enforcement
communities.  FLETC had nearly 600
full-time employees during fiscal 
2000. This staff was supplemented by 
nearly 200 personnel detailed from 
more than 20 participating Federal 
agencies to oversee their training 
programs. FLETC has an annual budget 
of over $100 million.

The basic training requirements for
Federal officers varied by agency and 
by position within agencies.  Overall,
FLETC offers more than 100 different
agency-specific training programs. 

Among major employers, classroom
training for criminal investigators 
ranged from about 8 weeks to 22 weeks.  
For patrol officers, classroom training 
ranged from 4 weeks to 26 weeks. Field
training requirements ranged from 2
weeks to 6 months for patrol officers,
and as long as 2 years of on-the-job
training for investigators.

During fiscal year 1970, its first 
year of operation, FLETC graduated 848
students.  In its first full year of
operations at its current headquarters
location at Glynco, Georgia, more than
5,000 students graduated.  In fiscal
2000, more than 23,000 graduated,
including about 3,400 State and local
officers.

Although a large majority of FLETC
graduates attend training at Glynco, 
the FLETC Artesia Center in New Mexico
graduated 2,420 students in fiscal 2000. 
This facility was established in 1990 
to provide training for agencies such 
as INS and BOP that have concentrations
of personnel in the western United
States.   

In 1995 a temporary FLETC satellite
training campus was established in
Charleston, South Carolina, to train 
INS and Border Patrol officers as these
forces expanded.  This facility had 
639 graduates during fiscal 2000. 

During fiscal year 2000 Federal
agencies with 400 or more FLETC
graduates included INS, 4,844; Customs
Service, 3,211; BOP, 2,554; ATF, 822;
Marshals Service, 776; IRS, 671;
National Park Service, 578; and the
Secret Service, 412.

Federal law enforcement officers
killed or assaulted, 1995-99
                       
The Uniform Crime Reports Division of
the FBI publishes data annually on law
enforcement officers killed or assaulted
in the United States and its territories. 
The Law Enforcement Officers Killed
and Assaulted (LEOKA) series covers
assaults on Federal officers employed in
the Departments of Interior, Justice, 
and Treasury, as well as the U.S. Postal
Service and U.S. Capitol Police.  

These agencies provided data on more
than 3,200 assaults on Federal officers
that occurred from 1995 through 1999. 
A total of 890, or 28%, of these assaults
resulted in personal injury to the officer. 
Twenty officers were feloniously killed
during this period, including 5 officers
with the INS and 4 with the Secret
Service.

Federal officers killed, 1995-99

National Park Service                 2
Bureau of Indian Affairs              2
Drug Enforcement Administration       1

About a third of all assaults on Federal
officers involved the use of personal
weapons such as hands, fists, or feet. 
About 15% involved the use of a firearm,
and 10% the use of a vehicle.  Bombs,
knives, and blunt objects each
accounted for less than 2% of assaults
on Federal officers.

Types of assaults on
Federal officers, 1995-99
 
Total                      100%
 
Personal                  32.8%
Threat                    18.2

Blunt object               1.3
Other                     19.1

The largest percentage of assaults on
Federal officers occurred while the
officer was on patrol or guard duty
(37%).  Twenty-one percent were
assaulted while conducting an
investigation or search, and 16% while
making an arrest or serving a summons.

Circumstance of assaults
on Federal officers, 1995-99
 
Total                                100%
 
Patrol/guard duty                   36.9%
Investigation/search                21.4
Arrest/summons                      16.3
Office duty                          4.5
Custody of prisoners                 3.6
Protection duty                      2.3
Court duty                           1.0
Other duties                        14.0

Based on 1995-99 LEOKA data for
agencies with 1,000 or more officers, the
National Park Service had the highest
average annual assault rate per 1,000
officers, 38.7.  The next highest rate was
at ATF (31.0), followed by DEA (17.9),
INS (14.1),  Marshals Service (9.7),
Customs Service (9.7), and Secret
Service (8.9).   When only assaults that
resulted in death or injury are
considered, the National Park Service
had a rate of 15 per 1,000, about 3 times
the next highest rate of 5.1 per 1,000 at
the U.S. Customs Service.

Although the LEOKA data do not provide
information below the agencylevel,
different divisions with an agency may
have dramatically different assault rates. 
For example, it is known that in 1992
there were 228 assaults on Border
Patrol agents.  Even using 1993
employment levels, this is an assault
rate of 58.1 per 1,000 officers,
considerably higher than the overall INS
rate.

The LEOKA data also do not include
assaults on Bureau of Prison staff;
however, BJS collects such data in its
Census of State and Federal
Correctional Facilities.  During the year
ending June 30, 2000, there were 1,295
assaults on Federal prison staff, with
none resulting in death.  Over its history,
BOP has experienced an average of one
correctional officer death about every 3
years.

The only agency with fewer than 1,000
officers for which data are reported in
LEOKA is the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
which had 281 officers as of June 2000. 
From 1996 to 1999 BIA had an average
of 38 assaults per year against its
officers.  This is equivalent to a annual
rate of 126 assaults per 1,000 officers,
including a rate of 51 per 1,000 for
assaults resulting in death or injury. 
These rates are more than 3 times that
of any other agency included in LEOKA.

                          Average annual number of assaults on Federal
                          officers with arrest and firearm authority, 1995-99
