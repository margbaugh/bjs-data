Highlights

Among 5.7 million violent victimizations in 
2001 -- most male victims faced strangers, 
while most female victims faced someone they
knew.  The crimes against females were more 
likely to be reported to the police.

*  The violent crime rate fell 10%, 2000-2001, 
due primarily to a significant decrease in the 
rate of simple assault, according to the
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). 

*  The overall property crime rate fell 6% 
between 2000 and 2001 because of decreases 
in theft and household burglary rates.  

*  Violent victimization and property crime 
rates in 2001 are the lowest recorded since 
the NCVS' inception in 1973. ***Footnote 1: 
Based on adjustments to pre-1992 estimates 
to account for the 1992 redesign of the 
NCVS.***

*  For the first year since the redesign of the 
NCVS in 1992, in 2001 males and females were
victims of simple assault at similar rates.

*  Per 1,000 persons in 2001, the never 
married and the divorced/separated were 
victimized by violent crime at rates (45 
and 42)about 4 times those of married and
widowed persons (11 and 8).

*  About half of violent victimizations
and 37% of property crimes were reported 
to the police in 2001. 

*  Most violent crime victims did not face 
an armed offender (66%).  Victims of rape/
sexual assault (7%)were the least likely, 
while robbery victims (55%) were the most 
likely to face an armed offender.
  
*  Violent crimes were less likely to
involve firearms in 2001 than in the
period 1993-96.  
----------------------------------------------

Americans age 12 or older experienced 
approximately 24.2 million violent and 
property victimizations in 2001 according 
to the National Crime Victimization Survey 
(NCVS).  Overall criminal victimizations 
included about 18.3 million property crimes 
(burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft), 
5.7 million violent crimes (rape, sexual
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and 
simple assault), and about 188,000 personal 
thefts (pocket picking and purse snatching).  

The 24.2 million criminal victimizations in 
2001 represent a decrease from 25.9 million
victimizations in 2000, and furthered
a downward trend that began in 1994. Criminal 
victimization estimates in 2001 are the lowest
recorded since the 1973 estimate of 44 million 
victimizations when the NCVS was initiated. 
The violent crime rate fell 10% from 28 to 25 
violent victimizations per 1,000 persons; the 
personal theft rate fell 33%; and the property
crime rate fell 6%, from 178 to 167
victimizations per 1,000 households, 2000-2001. 

Between 1993 and 2001 the violent crime rate 
decreased 50%, from 50 to 25 victimizations per 
1,000 persons age 12 or older, the personal 
theft rate fell 65%, and the property crime 
rate declined 48%.  

---------------------------------------------
Victimization trends, 1973-2001

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) 
is a victimization survey conducted from a 
large representative sample of U.S. households.  
First fielded in 1973 and redesigned most 
recently in 1992, the survey can now trace 
a three-decade trend in criminal victimization 
in the United States.***Footnote 2: For more 
information about the redesign, see The Effects
of the Redesign on Victimization Estimates 
(NCJ 164381), National Crime Victimization 
Survey (NCJ 151169), National Crime Victimization
Survey Redesign: Fact sheet (NCJ 151170),
Technical Background (NCJ 151172), and the 
Questions & Answers (NCJ 151171).***

Record lows

The rates per 1,000 persons or households 
in 2001 for overall violent crime (25), simple 
assault (16), overall property crime (167),
burglary (29), and theft (129) were the lowest 
ever recorded by the NCVS.  Other crime rates 
registered at their lowest point but were 
similar to 2000 rates.  These crimes
included --
*  1 rape/sexual assault, 3 robberies, and 
5 aggravated assaults per 1,000 persons.
*  9 motor vehicle thefts per 1,000
households.

Violent crime

The violent crime victimization rate fluctuated 
between 1973 and 1994 and has since steadily 
declined. The 10% decline for 2000-2001
equaled declines for 1994-1995 and 1995-1996, 
but was smaller than the 15% decrease for 
1999-2000.  

The robbery rate has moved in concert with the 
overall violent crime rate.  Initially, through 
1978, the robbery rate fell, then reversed
course and increased until 1981. After a decline 
ending in 1985, the robbery rate rose slowly 
until 1994 when it decreased until 1997. Since 
1997 the rate has not changed significantly 
from one year to the next.
 
The rate of aggravated assault declined with 
some interruptions from 1974 to the mid-1980's. 
Following several years of minimal changes, 
the aggravated assault rate increased 1990-
1993. Between 1994 and 2000 the aggravated 
assault rate fell steadily. Between 2000 and 
2001 the rate of aggravated assault did not 
change. 

Simple assault, the most common form of violent 
crime measured by the NCVS, increased 1974-1977 
then remained stable until 1979. The rate then 
declined until 1989, when it increased through 
1994. After 1994 the rate fell steadily to its
current lowest recorded level of 16 simple 
assaults per 1,000 persons. 

Property crime

Aside from an increase between 1973 and 1974, 
property crime rates have fallen through the
duration of the NCVS.  

The burglary rate, after a period of slow decline 
interrupted by an increase from 1980 to 1981, 
fell each year thereafter.  The 2001 burglary 
rate was about a third of the 1973 adjusted 
rate.

The motor vehicle theft rate, despite some 
periods of increase, primarily declined, 1973-
2000. From 2000 to 2001 the rate was stable.  
The 2001 rate of 9 motor vehicle thefts per 
1,000 households was about half the 1973 rate 
of 19 per 1,000 households.

The theft rate increased between 1973 and 1974, 
then stabilized until 1977.  After 1978 theft 
rates declined steadily, reaching the current 
lowest recorded rate of 129 thefts per 1,000 
households in 2001.
----------------------------------------------

Criminal victimization, 2000 to 2001 

Violent crime

The NCVS collects data on nonfatal crimes 
against persons age 12 or older, reported and 
not reported to the police, from a nationally
representative sample of U.S. households in 
the United States.  Information on homicide 
comes from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) 
Program of the FBI.  
         
Violent crimes measured by the NCVS

Overall violent victimization refers to rape, 
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, 
and simple assault taken as a whole.  The 
overall violent victimization rate declined 
10% from 28 to 25 victimizations per 1,000 
persons, 2000-2001.  

Of the major violent crimes covered by the 
NCVS, simple assault was the sole crime that 
decreased, 2000-2001 (18 to 16 simple assaults 
per 1,000 persons).  Apparent decreases in 
rates for rape/sexual assault, robbery and
aggravated assault were not significant. 
     
The rates at which males, whites, and non-
Hispanics were victimized by violent crimes 
declined, 2000-2001.  Males experienced a
17% drop; whites a 10% drop; and non-Hispanics 
a 12% drop in violence, 2000-2001.  
Statistically significant changes in rates of
violent victimization did not occur for females, 
Hispanics, blacks, and persons of "other" 
races (Asians, Native Hawaiians, other Pacific
Islanders, Alaska Natives, and American Indians 
considered together). 

The rate at which never married persons were 
victims of violent crime fell 13% from 51 to 
45 victimizations per 1,000, 2000-2001. Apparent 
declines in the rate of violent victimization
experienced by married, widowed and divorced/ 
separated persons were not significant.

Many apparent changes in the rate of violent 
victimization experienced by persons in different 
age categories were not significant, 2000-2001.  
Moreover, persons in age categories historically
associated with high rates of violence -- ages 
16-19 and 20-24   had no measurable declines in
rates from 2000 to 2001.  

Persons age 25 to 34 experienced violence at 
slightly decreased rates (35 to 29 per 1,000), 
while those age 50 to 64 experienced violence
at a rate that was 31% lower in 2001 than in 
2000.

---------------------------------------------
Change in violent victimization,
by category, 2000-2001

The figure shows the estimated annual 
percentage change in victimization rates 
from 2000 to 2001 for the categories that
comprise violent crime: homicide, rape 
and sexual assault, aggravated assault, 
simple assault, and robbery.  

The crime categories are displayed
vertically according to their 2001
rates per 1,000 population age 12
or older.  Total violent (the sum of
all types) is first with the highest
rate, and murder is last with the
lowest rate. 

Because the National Crime Victimization 
Survey relies on a sample of households, 
the rates and numbers from it are estimates
and are not exact. Each horizontal bar 
shows the range within which the true 
percent change in rates from year to year 
is likely to fall.  

If a bar is clear of the "No change" line, 
one may be reasonably certain a change 
occurred. If a bar crosses the "No change" 
line, there is a possibility that there was 
no change.  The degree of certainty depends 
on where the bar crosses the line.  A line 
shadows the bottom and a side of those bars
representing crime categories in which a 
statistically significant year-to-year 
change occurred. 

Bar lengths vary from crime to crime, 
dependent upon a variety of factors such as  
sample size and rarity of the event. Because
homicide rates are derived from nonsample data,  
the preliminary value for the 1999-2000 homicide
rate change is given as a point estimate and 
not as a range of estimates.  Murder rates have 
no variance associated with their point
estimates, though some discrepancies exist 
between UCR rates and Vital Statistics of the
National Center for Health Statistics.
--------------------------------------------

Persons in households with incomes of less 
than $7,500 a year experienced a 23% decline 
in the rate of violence, 2000-2001. 

Apparent decreases in the rate of violence 
experienced by residents of the South, 
Northeast, and the West -- historically 
associated with the highest rate of nonfatal 
violence -- were not significant, 2000-2001. 
A decline in the rate of violence occurred 
for Midwesterners, as the rate fell 20% from 
30 to 24 violent victimizations per 1,000 
persons during this time. 

Suburbanites experienced violent victimization 
at a rate lower in 2001 than in 2000. Between 
2000 and 2001, the rate of violence experienced 
by suburbanites fell 14% from 26 to 22 
victimizations per 1,000 persons. No measurable
change emerged in the rate of violence 
experienced by residents in urban and rural 
areas, 2000-2001. 

Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter 
measured by the UCR 

The murder and nonnegligent man-slaughter rate 
fell 3.1% between 1999 and 2000 from a rate 
of 5.7 to 5.5 murders per 100,000.***Footnote 2:
The FBI reported in its preliminary release of
crime data an increase of 3.1% in murder during
2001.  Based on the 2000 level of 15,517 murders,
the percentage represents 481 additional murders
in 2001. The estimated murder rate in 2001 of 7.2 
per 100,000 would be higher than the rates for 
1999 and 2000, the lowest levels since the mid-
1960's.  See <http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm>.***
The numbers of murders and nonnegligent homicides 
estimated in 2000 and 1999 were almost identical 
-- 15,517 and 15,522, respectively.

For the South there was a rate of 6.8 victims per 
100,000 inhabitants. The West and the Midwest had 
a murder rate of 5.1 per 100,000. The Northeast 
experienced murder at the lowest rate of all 
regions -- 4 per 100,000 persons.  Murder rates
declined in all regions between 1999 and 2000.  
The largest decline occurred in the West (6.5% 
less), while the smallest took place in the South 
(1.5% less).  

Cities experienced an increase of 0.7% in murder 
between 1999 and 2000.  Cities with less than 
10,000 persons experienced the greatest increase 
in murder (11.7%), while cities with a population 
of 250,000 or more experienced a decline in the
murder rate of 0.3%. 

----------------------------------------------
Murder in the United States, 2000

In 2000, the year in which the most recent 
data are available, the FBI reported a 
total of 15,517 murders or nonnegligent 
homicides. The total represents a .03%
decrease from the 15,522 murders recorded 
in 1999. The FBI defines murder in its 
annual Crime in the United States as the 
willful, nonnegligent killing of one human
being by another. The FBI's Uniform Crime 
Reporting (UCR) program gathers statistics 
on murder from over 16,000 city, county, 
and State law enforcement agencies.

Murder rates differ based on victim 
characteristics, but the relationship 
between victim characteristics and 
incidence of homicide tends to remain 
the same. In 2000:

*  Males accounted for 76% of all murder 
victims.  
*  When the race of the victim was known, 
white persons accounted for 6,263 and black 
persons accounted for 6,193 of all homicide 
victims.
*  44% of murder victims knew the offender; 
13% of victims were murdered by a stranger; 
and victim-offender relationship was
unknown for 43%.  
*  Firearms were used in 66% of murders
committed in 2000.  
*  Males (89%) and females (91%) were most 
often murdered by males. 
*  Arguments were the circumstance leading 
to murder for 29% of murders.
----------------------------------------------

Property crime

The NCVS includes as property crimes burglary, 
motor vehicle theft, and theft considered 
together. Between 2000 and 2001 the overall
property crime rate fell 6% from 178 to 167 
crimes per 1,000 households.  

The decline in overall property crime rates is 
explained by significant decreases in household
burglary and theft between 2000 and 2001. The 
decrease in the household burglary rate was 
driven by slight declines in the rate of
completed household burglary, attempted 
forcible entry and a significant decrease 
in the rate of unlawful entry without force.  
The drop in the theft rate resulted from
decreases in completed thefts of between 
$50 and $249 and attempted theft, 2000-2001.  

Property crime rates decreased between 2000 
and 2001 for black and non-Hispanic households.  
The rate for white households was only
slightly lower in 2001.  No measurable change 
occurred for households of persons of 
"other" races or of Hispanics, 
2000-2001.***Footnote 3: In this report, "other"
are defined as Asians, Native Hawaiians, other
Pacific Islanders, Alaska Natives, and American
Indians considered together.***
 
Households with an annual income of less than 
$7,500 and those with incomes between $25,000 
and $34,999 experienced property crimes at lower 
rates in 2001 than they did in 2000.  Persons in
households with incomes of $75,000 or more 
annually were victims of property crimes at 
rates slightly lower in 2001 than in 2000.

Apparent decreases in the property crime rates 
of households in the Midwest and the West were 
not significant, 2000-2001.  Households in the 
Northeast were property crime victims at a rate 
14% lower in 2001 compared to 2000 and
Southern households were victims of property 
crime at slightly lower rates in 2001 than in 
2000 (a 6% decrease).  Rural households were
property crime victims at rates 14% lower in 
2001 than in 2000.

Similarly households in rented residences were 
victims of property crime at rates 8% lower in 
2001 than in 2000. 

Characteristics of violent crime
victims, 2001

Teens and blacks  -- the persons often the most 
vulnerable to violent victimization in the 
past -- continued to be more vulnerable than 
others to violent victimization in 2001. 
 
Gender of victim

Males were victims of overall violent crime, 
robbery, total assault, and aggravated assault 
at rates higher than females, and females 
were victims of rape or sexual assault at
rates greater than males during 2001. For 
the first year since the redesign of the 
NCVS in 1992, in 2001 males and females 
were victims of simple assault at similar
rates.  In all previous years, males were 
victims of simple assault at higher rates 
than females.  

Age of victim

In general the younger the person, the 
higher rate of violent victimization. In 
2001 persons age 12 to 15 and age 16 to 19
experienced overall violence at similar 
rates, which were higher than rates of 
persons in older categories.  Beginning 
with the 20-24 age category, the rate at
which persons were victims of overall 
violent crime declined significantly as 
the age category increased.

Race of victim

Blacks were victims of overall violence, 
total assault, and aggravated assault at 
rates higher than whites or "others." Also 
in 2001 blacks were victims of simple
assault at rates similar to the rates
of whites and higher than the rates
of "others."  Rates of rape/sexual
assault and robbery were similar for
whites, blacks, and persons of "other 
races" in 2001.  

Hispanic origin of victim

During 2001 compared to non-
Hispanics, Hispanics were victims
of overall violence at somewhat
higher rates and robbery at
significantly higher rates.  No
measurable difference in the rates
of other violence crime categories
emerged. 

Household income

Few differences were found between household 
income levels as to whether persons were 
more or less vulnerable to violent crimes in
2001. Persons in households with an annual 
income under $25,000 were robbed at a 
significantly higher rate than persons 
in households earning more. Persons whose
household had an annual income of under 
$50,000 were significantly more likely than 
persons in higher income households to 
experience assault overall.  

Marital status

For all categories of violent crime
considered in 2001, persons who had never 
married and those who were divorced or 
separated were victimized at similar rates.  
In addition, never married, and divorced/
separated persons were victimized at rates 
higher than married and widowed persons, 
across all types of crime.  

Married and widowed persons were victims 
of rape/sexual assault and robbery at similar 
rates.  Widowed persons were victims of 
overall violent crime, total, aggravated and
simple assault at the lowest rate of all 
groups considered.

Region

Western residents were victimized
by violent crime overall, total
assault, and simple assault at the
highest rates in 2001.  Northeastern
residents were victims of overall
violence at rates significantly or
somewhat lower than in all other
regions.  Midwestern and Southern
residents were victimized at similar
rates for all violent crimes except
robbery.  Midwesterners were robbed at 
rates somewhat lower than Southerners 
during 2001. No other differences in rates 
of robbery emerged among the other regions.

Residence

Whatever the type of crime considered, urban 
residents experienced violence at rates
higher than suburban and rural residents in 
2001.  Urbanites were violent crime victims 
at rates about 50% greater than rates for
suburban residents, and 60% greater than rates 
for rural residents during 2001. For every crime
except robbery suburban and rural residents were 
victimized at similar rates.  Suburban 
residents were robbed at a rate about 
60% greater than the rate for rural 
residents.  

Characteristics of the crime event

Victim-offender relationship

Females identified friends or acquaintances 
as the offender(s) in a substantial portion 
of the violence that they experienced. Thirty-
seven percent of overall violent crime and 46% 
of rapes/sexual assaults were committed by a 
person the female victim called a friend or 
acquaintance.  Thirty-six percent of female 
victims of aggravated assault said the offender(s) 
was a friend or acquaintance.

About a third of all female victims of violent 
crime, and rape/sexual assault stated the 
offender(s) was a stranger.  Among female 
robbery victims, 51% identified the offender
as a stranger. 

As has been the case historically, a higher 
percentage of males than females were victimized 
by strangers.  Fifty-five percent of male
victims of violence stated that the offender was 
a stranger.  Similarly 56% of male victims of 
aggravated assault and 78% of male robbery
victims identified the offender as a stranger.  

Male victims knew the perpetrator in about 4 in 
10 violent crimes during 2001. Of violent crimes 
sustained by males, a friend or acquaintance
committed 37% of overall violent crime, 33% of 
aggravated assaults, and 42% of simple assaults. 

Presence of weapons

Except for robbery most victims of violent 
crimes did not face an armed offender. In 2001, 
66% of violent crime victims were victimized by 
unarmed offender(s). Rape and sexual assault 
victims (7%) were the least likely and robbery 
victims (55%), the most likely, to face an armed 
offender. Overall, 9% of the victims of violence 
were confronted by an offender with a firearm, 
7% faced an offender armed with a knife, and
11% stated the offender was armed with a weapon 
other than a firearm or knife.  

The type of weapon varied by the type of 
violence.  For example, 2% of victims of 
rape or sexual assault faced an offender 
armed with a firearm, compared to 31% of
robbery victims and 26% of assault victims.  
Similarly, 4% of rape/sexual assault 
victims were confronted by an offender
brandishing a knife, compared to 14% of 
robbery victims and 6% of assault victims. 

The percentage of violent crimes with a 
weapon present declined between 1993 and 
2001. A weapon was present during 30% of 
all violent crimes in 1993, compared to
26% in 2001. A smaller percentage of violent 
crimes were committed with a firearm in 
2001 compared to 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996.  
Each year from 1993 to 1996, between 11% and 
12% of all violent crimes were committed 
with a firearm present.  In 2001, 9% of all 
violent crimes were committed with a firearm 
present. 

Characteristics of victims of
property crime, 2001

Race of head of household 

Blacks were victims of burglary and motor 
vehicle theft at rates higher than those of 
whites and "others" during 2001.  During 
the same year whites and "others" were 
victims of all types of property crimes at
similar rates.  Blacks, whites, and "others" 
were property theft victims at similar rates 
during 2001. 

Hispanic origin of head of household 

Hispanics experienced overall property crime, 
motor vehicle theft, and theft at rates 
greater than those of non- Hispanics, 2001.  
The burglary rates for the two groups were 
similar. 

Annual household income

No relationship between annual household 
income and the rate of total property crime 
emerged in 2001.  Similarly, no difference 
in rates of motor vehicle theft were noted 
among adjacent income categories. Comparing 
burglary rates between adjacent income 
categories shows that households earning 
$7,499 or less annually were burglarized at 
a rate greater than that for households 
with incomes between $7,500 and $14,999. 
Households with annual incomes of $25,000 
to $34,999 were burglarized at a rate higher
than that for households with incomes between 
$35,000 and $49,999.  

With one exception no differences in theft 
rates between income categories emerged. 
Households with incomes of $35,000 to $49,999
annually were theft victims at a rate slightly 
higher than that for households with incomes 
of $25,000 to $34,999.  

Region, locality, and home ownership

Western households sustained the highest 
rate of overall property crime during 2001.  
Midwestern households experienced the second
highest rate of property crime during this 
time.  Northeastern households were victims 
of overall property crime at the lowest rate,
and Southern households the second lowest 
rate of overall property crime during 2001.

Northeastern households were burglarized at 
rates lower than those for all other regions, 
while Southern, Western and Midwestern
households were burglarized at similar rates.  
Households in the West experienced motor 
vehicle theft at rates higher than those for
households in all other regions. 

Urban households were the most vulnerable to 
all types of property crime during 2001.  
Suburban households experienced all forms of
property crime except burglary at rates higher 
than those for rural households.  No measurable
difference in suburban and rural rates of 
burglary emerged during 2001.

Property crime occurred at higher rates among 
households renting than among households 
owning the residence.  

Reporting to the police
                   
Forty-nine percent of all violent victimizations 
and 37% of all property crimes were reported to
the police during 2001.  Of the violent crimes 
in 2001, 39% of rape/sexual assault, 61% of
robbery, 59% of aggravated assault and 45% 
of simple assault were brought to the 
attention of the police.  Motor vehicle theft
continued to be the property crime reported 
to the police at the highest percentage (82%).  
Fifty-four percent of burglaries and 30% of
theft were reported to the police, 2001.

Reporting crime to the police,
2000-2001

The percentage of victimizations reported to 
police in 2001 remained statistically similar 
to 2000 levels regardless of the crime 
considered. 

Reporting and victim characteristics

Violent victimization of females was reported 
to police in higher percentages than the 
victimization of males during 2000 (53% and
46% respectively). 

The gender difference in reporting of violence 
to police existed to varying degrees depending 
on the race of the victim.  A higher percentage 
of violence against white females compared to 
white males was brought to the attention of the 
police.  Apparent differences in reporting to 
police between males and females in other 
categories of race were not statistically
significant.

Considering only males, the percentage of 
violent victimizations reported to the police 
did not differ significantly across racial 
categories or by Hispanic origin. With one
exception among females, concerning violent 
crimes reported to the police, there were no
differences in the percentages across racial 
categories or by Hispanic origin. Violent 
crimes against black females were reported 
to the police in percentages slightly greater 
than those against "other" females.

Victimization trends, 1993-2001

Trends in this section use 1993 as the 
beginning point because it was the first 
full year of NCVS data collected after the 
redesign was applied.   

The rate of every major violent and
property crime measured in the NCVS -- rape/
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, 
simple assault, burglary theft, and motor 
vehicle theft -- fell significantly between 
1993 and 2001. 

Murder and nonnegligent
manslaughter

Based on FBI data for 2000 (the most recent 
year available), the rate and overall number 
of murders in the United States continued a
steady decline that began in 1993. According 
to estimates, 15,517 murders occurred in 
2000, compared to 24,350 recorded in
1993.  

While homicide numbers and rates change, 
victim characteristics remain unchanged.  
For example, whites and blacks each continue 
to comprise about half of murder victims.  
(See box and footnote on page 5 for additional 
information on murder and on the preliminary 
UCR estimates for 2001.)

Violent crime

The overall violent crime rate fell 50% from 
50 to 25 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 
12 or older between 1993 and 2001.  Other
significant declines occurred in rates of 
rape/sexual assault (down 56%), robbery (down 
53%), aggravated assault (down 56%), and simple 
assault (down 46%). Rates for completed/attempted 
rape and attempted robbery without injury were 
among those showing the greatest decline 
between 1993 and 2001. 

Personal theft               
    
Rates of personal theft (purse snatching and 
pocket picking) decreased 65% from 2.3 personal
thefts in 1993 to 0.8 per 1,000 persons in 2001.

Property crime

From 1993 through 2001, the rate of overall 
property crime fell, as did the rate for each 
major type of property crime examined. Rates of
household burglary fell 51%; motor vehicle 
theft fell 52%; and theft fell 47%. Of the 
categories of property crime considered, 
attempted burglary by forcible entry and
attempted theft rates were among those 
showing the greatest decline, 1993-2001.  

-----------------------------------------
Trends in violent victimization

Because the National Crime
Victimization Survey relies on a
sample of households, the rates
and numbers from it are estimates
and are not exact.

The figure shows the violent
victimization rate trend line,
1973-2001:  Each vertical bar
shows the range within which the
true victimization rate is likely 
to fall for the indicated year.  
The white trend line represents the best
estimate -- the most likely value for
the rate in each year -- which is the
published estimates.  There is a
greater likelihood that the true rate
will fall near the best estimate, and
the bars reflect that likelihood:  The
darker the bar segment, the greater
the likelihood.

The precision of estimates derived
from samples is related to the
sample size.  In general, the larger
the sample, the more precise the
estimate and smaller the range
bars.  Some year-to-year changes
are so large that contiguous bars do
not touch (1980-81, 1982-83,
1990-91, 1994-95, 1995-96, 
1999-00, and 2000-01), suggesting
a change in the year-to-year
victimization rate   a statistically 
significant difference.

 Overlap in the bars from 1986 to
1990 suggests, but does not guarantee,
that the year-to-year differences in
victimization estimates are too small
to conclude that a change in the 
victimization rate occurred. There may
be significant year-to-year changes 
even when the bars overlap slightly,
as in 2000-01, because of the strong
correlation between crime rates in
successive years.

Even with the range of possible
victimization rates, general trends
are apparent.  Violent crime rates
in-creased from the early 1970's to
the early 1980's, then fell until the
mid-1980's.  For several years in
the late 1980's, violent crime rates
were stable, but increased in the
early 1990's and fell 1994-2001.

Characteristics of victims

With few exceptions, persons in
most demographic categories --
gender, race, Hispanic origin, and
household income -- experienced
significant decreases in violent
victimization, 1993-2001.  The rate
of violent victimization for each
group fell significantly, 1993-2001,
with two exceptions: rates of
violence against persons of “other
races” demonstrated no measurable change 
and against Hispanics, only a slight 
change.   

Among groups examined the largest decline 
in the rate of violent crime occurred among 
black persons and individuals in households 
with annual incomes of less than $7,500. Males
experienced 4.7 fewer violent crimes (per 
1,000 males) on average each year, 1993-2001. 
Persons in households with incomes of less than 
$7,500 annually experienced an average of
4.9 fewer violent crimes (per 1,000 persons) 
each year, 1993-2001.

Between 1993 and 2001 the rate at which all 
property crimes were committed in the United 
States fell for every group considered.  The
greatest decline in the property crime rate 
occurred for Hispanic households, which 
experienced an average of 28.7 fewer property
crimes (per 1,000 Hispanic households) each 
year, 1993-2001.

Survey methodology      
                   
This Bulletin presents data on non-lethal 
violence and property crimes from the 
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), 
and data on homicide from the FBI's
Uniform Crime Reporting program. The NCVS 
collects data on nonfatal crimes against 
persons age 12 or older, reported and not 
reported to the police, from a nationally
representative sample of households in the 
United States. The NCVS provides information
about victims (age, gender, race, ethnicity,
marital status, income and educational 
level), offenders (gender, race, approximate 
age, and victim-offender relations), and
criminal offenses (time and place of occurrence, 
use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic
consequences).

In 2001, 43,680 households and 79,950 people 
age 12 or older were interviewed.  For the 2000
NCVS data presented here, the response rate 
was 93.0% of eligible households and 89.3% of
eligible individuals.  

Estimates were calculated from data collected 
during the calendar year being estimated. That 
is, the data include victimizations that were
identified in interviews conducted in 2001. 
Because of the retrospective nature of the 
survey, the estimates include some incidents 
that actually occurred during the previous year. 
Analyses comparing the victimization data 
collected in a calendar year to data occurring 
in a calendar year the victimization occurred 
(a data year) show small differences in 
estimates.  For example, the 1995 violent 
crime rate was 44.5 (per 1,000) using data year 
data, compared to 46.6 using calendar year data. 
Differences in estimates obtained from data year 
and calendar year methods are greater during 
periods of changing rates and less during periods 
of stable rates.

Standard error computations

Comparisons of estimates discussed were tested 
to determine if the differences were statistically
significant.  Differences described as higher, 
lower, or different passed a hypothesis test at 
the .05 level of statistical significance (95%-
confidence level). That is, the tested difference 
was greater than twice the standard error of that
difference.  For comparisons of estimates which 
were statistically significant at the 0.10 level
(90%-confidence level), differences are 
described as somewhat, marginal, or slight.  

Caution is required when making comparisons 
of estimates not explicitly discussed in the 
Bulletin. What may appear to be a large
difference in estimates may not test as 
statistically significant at the 95%-or even 
the 90%-confidence level. Significance testing 
calculations were conducted at BJS using
statistical programs developed specifically 
for the NCVS by the U.S. Census Bureau. These
programs consider the complex NCVS sample 
design when calculating generalized variance
estimates. 

Testing trends and annual differences 
in violent and property victimization

When a statement is made describing differences 
in estimates between two years, it was tested 
for significance using a computer program designed 
specifically for the NCVS.  These tests determine
whether an estimate in one year differs from 
that of another, regardless of intervening 
estimate variation.  For instance, the percent
changes in victimization rates in table 8 were 
based on such a test.

When a statement is made describing the increase 
or decrease of a linear trend, it was tested 
using a linear trend test.  This test compares 
the slope of the trend to a horizontal line 
(a slope of zero).  The purpose of this test is 
to ascertain whether the slope generated from a 
change in estimates differs from a flat trend --
taking into account estimate variation in 
intervening years. 

The linear trend test is a regression equation 
using time as the independent variable, and the
estimate of victimization as the dependent 
variable.  A regression coefficient (b) and its 
corresponding standard error (sigma) are computed. 
Next a t-statistic -- the ratio b/sigma -- is
calculated.  If the t-statistic is greater than 
1.96 for a two-tailed test, the slope is different 
from zero, and if the t-statistic is greater than
1.645 for a two-tailed test, the slope is slightly 
different from zero.  If the t-statistic is less 
than the critical value, the trend of the estimates
does not differ significantly from a flat line.  

Linear trend tests were applied in 
Characteristics of victims on page
13 and Reporting to the police on
page 10.  In NCVS publications prior 
to 1999, linear trend tests were not 
used.

Definitions

Violent crime is defined in this report as 
attempted or completed rape, sexual assault, 
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple
assault.  Definitions used in this report 
are as follows:

Rape is forced sexual intercourse, including 
both psychological coercion and physical 
force. Forced sexual intercourse means
vaginal, anal, or oral penetration by
the offender(s). This category includes 
incidents where the penetration is from a 
foreign object such as a bottle.  This 
definition includes attempted rapes, male 
and female victims, and heterosexual
and homosexual rape.

Sexual assault includes a wide range of 
victimizations, distinct from rape or attempted 
rape.  These crimes include completed or
attempted attacks generally involving unwanted 
sexual contact between the victim and offender. 
Sexual assaults may or may not involve force 
and include such things as grabbing or fondling. 
Sexual assault also includes verbal threats.

Robbery is a completed or attempted theft 
directly from a person, of property or cash 
by force or threat of force, with or without 
a weapon, and with or without an injury.

Aggravated assault is a completed or attempted 
attack with a weapon, whether or not an injury 
occurred. It is also an attack without a weapon
in which the victim is seriously injured.

Simple assault is an attack without a weapon 
resulting either in no injury, minor injury 
(such as bruises, black eyes, cuts, scratches, 
or swelling), or an undetermined injury
requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization.  
Simple assaults also include attempted assaults
without a weapon.

Burglary is the unlawful or forcible
entry or attempted entry of a
residence. This crime usually, but
not always, involves theft. The
illegal entry may be by force, such
as breaking a window or slashing a
screen, or may be without force by
entering through an unlocked door
or an open window. As long as the
person entering has no legal right to
be present in the structure a
burglary has occurred. Furthermore,
the structure need not be the house
itself for a burglary to take place;
illegal entry of a garage, shed, or any 
other structure on the premises also 
constitutes household burglary. If 
breaking and entering occurs in a hotel 
or vacation residence, it is still
classified as a burglary for the
household whose member or members were 
staying there at the time the entry 
occurred.

Motor vehicle theft includes the
stealing or unauthorized taking of a
motor vehicle, including attempted
thefts.

Theft is the taking of property or
cash without personal contact.
Incidents involving theft of property
from within the sample household
would classify as theft if the
offender has a legal right to be in
the house (such as a maid, delivery
person, or guest). If the offender
has no legal right to be in the
house, the incident would classify
as a burglary.
