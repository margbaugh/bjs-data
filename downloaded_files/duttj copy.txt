*  An estimated 61,000 (16%) convicted jail 
inmates committed their offense to get money 
for drugs. 

*  Two-thirds of convicted jail inmates were 
actively involved with drugs prior to their 
admission to jail.

*  Overall, 71% of local jail jurisdictions 
reported that they had a policy to test inmates 
or staff for drug use in 1998.  In
June, a fourth of the jails tested samples from inmates.

About 10% of drug tests conducted on jail inmates in June 1998
showed drug use

*  Nearly 5 in 10 jurisdictions that test 
staff reported dismissal from employment 
as the only action taken when staff test 
positive for drug use.

*  On June 30, 1998, about 92,600 jail 
inmates had participated in drug and 
alcohol programs or substance abuse 
treatment, including inmates who may have 
been enrolled in more than one program.
----------------------------------------------------------------
In 1998 an estimated 417,000 jail inmates (70% of all inmates in
local facilities) had committed a drug offense or used drugs
regularly, compared to 261,000 (67%) in 1989. About 138,000
convicted jail inmates were under the influence of drugs at the
time of the offense.  About 72,000 convicted jail inmates had
used marijuana or hashish and 59,000 had used cocaine or crack
cocaine. 

Offenders in local jails reported a history of prior drug use
similar to that of State prison inmates. Over half of jail (55%)
and State inmates (57%) said they had used drugs in the month
before the offense. About a fifth of these jail inmates and a
third of State   inmates had participated in substance abuse
programs or treatment since admission.  Compared to offenders on
probation (32%), jail inmates were more likely to report using
drugs in the month before the offense.  A higher percentage of
probationers than jail inmates had participated in treatment
since beginning their sentence (42%). 

This report, the third in the series on prior drug use and
treatment of offenders, focuses on local jail inmates and jail
jurisdictions. Past BJS reports include Substance Abuse and
Treatment, State and Federal Prisoners, 1997, and Substance
Abuse and Treatment of Adults on Probation, 1995.

Jails are correctional facilities operated by cities, counties,
or other local authorities.  Jail inmates are persons usually
sentenced to a short term (generally under a year) but may
include any detention status, such as sentenced to more than a
year to be served in jail, held for State prisons due to
overcrowding, awaiting trial or sentencing, or not yet arraigned.

Data on drug testing and treatment in local jail jurisdictions
are from the 1998 Annual Survey of Jails.  A special addendum on
drug testing, sanctions, and interventions was included with the
standard survey questions on supervised population and inmate
counts and movements.  A representative sample of 820 jail
jurisdictions out of 2,890 provided information on policies for
conducting drug tests on inmates and staff, criteria for
selection for testing, number of positive tests for inmates,
sanctions for positive test results, and substance abuse
programs or treatment. (See Methodology for sample description.)
------------------------------------------------------------

55% of convicted jail inmates were using drugs in the month
before the offense; 36% at the time of the offense

*  A quarter of jail inmates had a current charge or conviction
for drug law violations. About 15% had a charge or conviction
for drug possession and 9% for trafficking.

*  30% of convicted jail inmates had been previously sentenced
or incarcerated for drug possession, trafficking, or other drug
offenses, compared to 21% of unconvicted jail inmates.

*  About 82% of all inmates said they had ever used drugs at
least once and 64% said they had used drugs regularly (that is,
at least once a week for at least a month).

*  18% of convicted jail inmates said they had used intravenous
drugs in the past, compared to 15% of unconvicted inmates.

*  Nearly 1 in 6 of convicted jail inmates committed their
offense to get money for drugs.

trial on trial, or not yet arraigned; and 3.9% had an unknown conviction
status.

---------------------------------------------------------------- 

Other findings in this report are based on data from the Survey
of Inmates in Local Jails, 1996.  Over 6,100 inmates from 431
jails in personal interviews answered a series of questions on
their current and past offense history, drug and alcohol use and
treatment, family background, and conditions of confinement. 
(Data on these topics with comparison to surveys conducted in
1989 and 1983 are available in Profile of Jail Inmates, 1996,
NCJ 164620).

BJS surveys and special collections provide a national
perspective on the prevalence of drug use and drug crimes among
local jail inmates. (See adjacent box.)  In 1996, 82% of all
jail inmates said they had used drugs at least once in their
life.  Among convicted jail inmates, 55% said they had used
illegal drugs in the month before the offense.  A quarter of
jail inmates had a current drug offense, and over a quarter had
a prior conviction for drug law violations. 

In recent years drug testing and treatment have increasingly
become the focus of efforts to detect and control drug use in
jails.  In assessing who should be tested and treated for drug
use, jurisdictions may consider past drug involvement or active
drug involvement prior to the current admission.

Jail inmates reported high levels of 
drug involvement

On specific measures of reported past drug involvement, 64% of
jail inmates  had used drugs regularly, 42% had received
treatment, 17% had used intravenous drugs, and 27% had a prior
sentence for drug law violations.  In combination, 74% of all
jail inmates reported some past involvement with drugs.

In the 1996 inmate survey only convicted jail inmates were
asked about the level of drug use immediately prior to the
current offense.  An estimated 66% of convicted jail inmates
reported active involvement with drugs.  For this report, active
drug involvement is defined as those who had used drugs in the
month before the offense (55%) or at the time of the offense
(36%), committed the offense for money for drugs (16%), had
received treatment since admission (13%), or had a current drug
charge (26%).

---------------------------------------- 

Nearly a third of convicted jail inmates who had been involved
with drugs in the past were not using drugs in the month before
the offense.  Among convicted inmates about 37% said they were
using marijuana or hashish a month before their offense, and 24%
said they were using cocaine or crack cocaine.

Actively drug-involved jail inmates 
younger and more likely to be black 
than other inmates

The proportions of actively drug-involved jail inmates varied
across gender, racial or ethnic groups, and age categories. 
Males made up the majority of both actively drug-involved and other 
inmates. However, women were a larger percentage of actively
drug-involved inmates (11%) than of other inmates (9%).

Black or African American inmates were 41% of actively
drug-involved inmates, compared to 35% of other inmates.  Nearly
equal percentages of actively drug-involved (18%) and other
inmates (19%) were Hispanic.

About 65% of actively drug-involved inmates were between ages 25
and 44, compared to 60% of other inmates. Inmates between 18 and
24 were 29% of actively drug-involved inmates and 26% of other
inmates.

Jails emphasized testing to control 
drug use

In response to the inmates' high levels of drug involvement,
many jail jurisdictions have established drug testing policies
to help control drug use in their facilities. In 1998 about 7 in
10 jail jurisdictions reported that they had a policy to conduct
urinalysis or other tests, such as blood, hair, and saliva
analysis, to determine drug use by inmates or staff.  (For
details on drug testing methods and procedures, see Integrating
Drug Testing into a Pretrial Service System: 1999 Update, Bureau
of Justice Assistance, NCJ 176340.)

Small jurisdictions (with fewer than 50 inmates) were less
likely than jurisdictions with 1,000 inmates or more to have a
policy to conduct tests for drugs.  Six in ten small
jurisdictions said they tested inmates or staff for drugs,
compared to 8 in 10 large jurisdictions.  The size of jail
jurisdiction is based on the average daily population for the 12
months ending June 30, 1998, and reported in the Annual Survey
of Jails.

Over a fifth of the jurisdictions said they tested inmates only,
while nearly a quarter tested staff only.  A quarter said they
tested both inmates and staff. 

Half of all inmates were in jails that 
tested for drug use

Relative to the average daily population, nearly 54% of all
inmates (an estimated 318,100 jail inmates) were in jails that
tested for illegal drug use.  Four percent of the inmates
subject to drug testing policies were in small jurisdictions,
although these jurisdictions represented 40% of those with a
policy to test inmates for drugs.

between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998.
 
In contrast, the largest jurisdictions (with 1,000 inmates or
more) represented 5% of jurisdictions that tested inmates and
held 47% of inmates subject to drug testing. 

69% of jurisdictions test inmates 
mainly on indication of use

Jurisdictions use a variety of methods to select inmates for
drug testing.  All inmates in some facilities may be tested upon
entry for the first time; inmates in other facilities may be
selected at random after a set length of stay or at
unpredictable times or may be tested upon indication of use of
an illegal drug.  Some jurisdictions also test all inmates upon
reentry into a facility after an absence for activities such as
a work release, furlough, or court visit.

In 1998 over two-thirds of the jurisdictions selected inmates
for testing on indication of use; about half selected inmates at
random; and 5% had a policy to test all inmates at admission.

Jurisdictions that specified other criteria for selecting
inmates for testing (30%) generally reported that they
systematically tested all offenders who returned to the facility
from a temporary absence from custody.  They also tested inmates
when requested or required by another agency, such as the
courts, probation or parole departments, or medical services.

Nearly 60% of jurisdictions with 100 or more inmates said they
tested inmates randomly, compared to 40% of jurisdictions with
fewer than 100 inmates. Seven in ten of both small jurisdictions
and those with 1,000 or more inmates reported that they tested
on indication of use.  About 2% of the jurisdictions with fewer
than 50 inmates, compared to 10% of those with 1,000 or more
inmates, reported testing all inmates at admission.

Over two-thirds of the jails that 
tested inmates had at least one 
positive test

Of the jail jurisdictions that had a policy to conduct
urinalysis or other tests on inmates for drug use, 712
jurisdictions collected over 36,200 samples from inmates 
between June 1 and June 30, 1998.  Multiple samples may
have been taken from one inmate. Jurisdictions with fewer than
50 inmates collected 4% of the samples; however, they comprised
about a third of the jurisdictions that tested samples for
drugs.  About half of the samples were collected in jurisdictions 
with 1,000 inmates or more.

10% of tests conducted in June 1998 
were positive for one or more drugs

Ten percent of the samples overall (3,800) were positive for one
or more drugs.  Over two-thirds of jurisdictions that tested
inmates had at least one positive test, while the rate of
positive tests in jurisdictions with 1,000 inmates or more (7%)
was lower than that for jurisdictions with fewer than 50 inmates
(28%).

The percentage of tests found positive for drug use varied by
testing policy. Samples that were selected on indication of use
only had the highest rate of positive results (14%), followed by
both random or indication of use (13%). Within jurisdictions
that tested only randomly, 8% of samples were positive for drugs.

                            Samples collected

Most jurisdictions take away inmate 
privileges for a positive test result

Among the legal and administrative sanctions that may be imposed
when inmates test positive for drugs, 70% of the jurisdictions
reported that they usually take away inmates privileges, while
about half said they take away good time or reclassify the
offender to a higher security level.  Twenty percent of the
jurisdictions reported that they add time to the inmate sentence
for a positive test result, compared to 39% that charge the
offender with a new offense.  Around a quarter of all
jurisdictions said they increase drug testing after a positive
test. 

Jail inmates were more likely to be reclassified to a higher
security level in large jail jurisdictions after a positive test
for drugs.  About 7 in 10 jurisdictions with 1,000 or more
inmates reclassified offenders, compared to almost 2 in 6
jurisdictions with fewer than 50 inmates.

*Based on the average daily population between
July 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998.
 
Across all jurisdictions, only a small percentage said that they
imposed mandatory treatment for a positive test. About 22% of
larger jurisdictions imposed mandatory treatment for inmates who
tested positive for drugs, followed by 10% of jurisdictions with
100 to 249 inmates, and 9% of those with 500 to 999 inmates. 
Seven percent of jurisdictions with fewer than 50 inmates
mandated treatment. About 19% of small jurisdictions reported
that they separate inmates from the general population after a
positive test, compared to 52% of large jurisdictions.

70% of jail jurisdictions tested all 
staff; 20%, new employees only 

Drug testing policies to detect and control drug use in jails
also include jail employees.  About 49% of jurisdictions said
they tested staff, and 47% test inmates.  Among the 1,418 jail
jurisdictions that had a policy to test staff, 70% said that all
staff were subject to testing for illegal drug use, including
supervisors, administrative staff, corrections officers, and
program or treatment personnel.  A fifth of the jurisdictions
tested only prospective employees as a condition of employment,
and 1% tested corrections officers only. Around 7 in 10 large
jurisdictions had a policy to test staff, compared to 4 in 10
small jurisdictions.

Jail jurisdictions were similar to other employers with regard
to testing staff for illegal drug use. In general, employers
nationwide have implemented workplace drug testing programs to
comply with Federal regulations or insurance requirements, to
protect the organization from safety problems and costs
associated with illegal drug use on the job, or for a variety of
other reasons.

In the 1997 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse, 49% of
employees who were working 35 hours or more a week at the time
of the interview said their workplace had a drug testing
program.*See, SAMHSA, The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse,
Testing Programs, 1997,http://www.samhasa/gov/oas/NHSDA/A-11
WrkplcPlcy2-06.htm.* The survey also included prevalence estimates 
of drug testing in the workplace by the number of employees at an
establishment.  About 74% of employees at large establishments
(500 or more employees) said  their workplace had at least one
type of workplace drug testing program, compared to slightly
more than 28% for small establishments (24 or fewer employees).

Most jail employees are tested 
at random

About 63% of jail jurisdictions reported that they tested staff
at random, followed by 40% that tested on indication of use.  
Nearly three-quarters of jurisdictions holding fewer than 50
inmates said that staff were selected at random for drug
testing, compared to over half of jurisdictions with 1,000 or
more inmates.  Small jurisdictions were less likely to select
staff on indication of use (37%) than large jurisdictions (61%).

Around 45% of jurisdictions said that they used a combination of
criteria to select staff for testing.  About 41% selected staff
at random only, and 15% selected on indication of use only. 

In 7 in 10 jail jurisdictions a positive 
test was grounds for dismissal

Jurisdictions usually fired staff or did not hire prospective
employees after a positive result on a test for drugs. About 71%
percent overall reported that dismissal was the usual action
taken after a positive test result.  Nearly half (49%) of the
jurisdictions used dismissal as the only disciplinary action for
an employee who tested positive for drugs.

In establishing policies to test staff or inmates for drugs,
jurisdictions have adopted rules and procedures to ensure that
disciplinary actions are not imposed for false positive test
results or for legitimate reasons such as over-the-counter or
prescription medications that can cause a positive test.  Drug
testing procedures generally include chain of custody
documentation, a confirmation test after the initial positive
test, drug cut-off levels for positive or negative results, and
a medical review to certify that testing procedures were
followed. During the review and confirmation process, sanctions
may be imposed while an employee continues working.

Among the sanctions that permitted jail staff to continue
working after a positive test for drugs, about 4% of
jurisdictions said they allowed staff to continue to work with
restrictions on contact with inmates.  An equal percentage (29%)
said they referred staff either to internal affairs or the
police or to substance abuse treatment.  About 11% increased
drug testing of staff after a positive test.

Over half of the jurisdictions with 1,000 or more inmates said
they referred employees to internal affairs or police after a
positive test for drugs, compared to nearly a fifth of small
jurisdictions.  About 3 in 8 jurisdictions in each category
between 100 and 999 inmates said they referred staff for legal
actions after a positive drug test.

Across all jurisdictions, a larger percentage said they referred
staff to treatment after a positive test than required mandatory
treatment for inmates.  About 41% of large jurisdictions and 28%
of small jurisdictions  referred staff to treatment. Except
jurisdictions with 1,000 inmates or more, around 10% or less in
each size category mandated treatment for inmates.

Self-help programs like Alcoholics 
Anonymous or Narcotics 
Anonymous common in jails

Although jurisdictions were unlikely to mandate treatment for
inmates after a positive drug test, almost three-quarters
provided substance abuse treatment or other programs for their
inmates.  Substance abuse treatment includes detoxification,
professional counseling, a residential stay, or maintenance drug
programs. Other programs include Alcoholics Anonymous (AA),
Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and other self-help groups, and drug
or alcohol education or awareness.

About 43% of jurisdictions provided substance abuse treatment,
while 68% provided other programs.  Within the specific types of
substance abuse programs provided in jails, self-help groups
(such as AA, NA, and other peer group counseling) were the most
common (64%).  About 30% had education or awareness programs.

Overall, 12% of jail jurisdictions provided all types of
programs and treatment, and about 22% had only AA, NA, or other
self-help programs.

Smaller jurisdictions were less likely to have substance abuse
treatment or programs than larger jurisdictions. About 63% of
jurisdictions with fewer than 50 inmates had some type of
treatment or program.  About 26% of jurisdictions with fewer
than 50 inmates and of those with 50 to 99 inmates had a
detoxification unit.  These jurisdictions primarily had
self-help groups, 52% and 68%, respectively.

About 90% of jurisdictions that held 250 or more inmates
provided some type of treatment or program.  Over half of large
jurisdictions had a detoxification unit.  Seven in ten
jurisdictions with 1,000 or more inmates provided education or
awareness, and 8 in 10 provided self-help groups.

Large jails had three-quarters of the 
total capacity for substance abuse 
treatment

In the Annual Survey of Jails, jurisdictions were asked to
report the capacity for substance abuse treatment, including
detoxification, professional counseling, rehabilitation, and
maintenance drug programs.  About 10% or 282 jurisdictions
reported that they had the capacity to provide substance abuse
treatment.  Nearly three-quarters of the reported capacity was
in jurisdictions with 500 or more inmates.

92,600 inmates participated in drug 
or alcohol programs or treatment

As of June 30, 1998, an estimated 92,600 inmates had
participated in substance abuse treatment or programs.  This
included 42,100 in AA, NA, or other self-help groups, 27,000 in
drug or alcohol education or awareness, 2,100 in detoxification,
and 21,400 in other substance abuse treatment. Inmates may have
been in more than one program.

61% of inmates who had used drugs 
at the time of the offense had 
received treatment in the past

Based on self-reported information in the jail inmates survey,
over half of jail inmates who said they had ever used drugs and
those who used regularly had participated in substance abuse
treatment or programs in the past.  Among convicted inmates  58%
of those who had used drugs in the month before the offense and
61% of those who had used drugs at the time of the offense had
participated in substance abuse treatment or programs.

Overall, an estimated 10% of jail inmates said they had
participated in substance abuse treatment or programs since
their admission to jail. Of jail inmates who had ever used drugs
or had ever used them regularly, 13% and 14%, respectively, had
participated in substance abuse treatment or programs since
admission.  About 17% of inmates who had used in the month
before the offense had participated since admission. Around 19%
of jail inmates who had used drugs at the time of the offense
had participated in substance abuse treatment or programs.

Methodology

Survey of Inmates in Local Jails

The 1996 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails was conducted from
October 1995 through March 1996 in personal interviews with
6,133 inmates. Similar surveys of jail inmates were conducted in
1972, 1978, 1983, and 1989.

The sample for the 1996 survey design was a stratified two-stage
selection from a universe of 3,328 jails. In the first stage,
six separate strata were formed based on the size of the male
and female populations.  In two strata all jails were selected
-- those jails housing only females and those with more than
1,000 males or more than 50 females or both.

In the remaining four strata, each jail within a stratum had an
equal probability of selection in the sample. Overall, 462 jails
were selected.  Interviews were conducted in 431 jails; 19
refused, 8 were closed, and 4 were on the universe list in error.

In the second sampling stage, interviewers visited each selected
facility and systematically selected a sample of male and female
inmates using predetermined procedures.  Approximately 1 in
every 100 males were selected in 4 strata, and 1 in 83 in the
male stratum.  Depending on the stratum, 1 in 50, 25, 24, or 21
females were selected.

Estimates from the 1996 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails are
affected by sampling and measurement errors.  Sampling error may
occur by chance because a sample rather than a complete
enumeration of the population was conducted.  Measurement error
can be attributed to nonresponse, differences in the
interpretation of questions among inmates, recall difficulties,
and processing errors.  In any survey the full extent of the
measurement error is never known.

Estimates of the standard errors for jail inmates identified as
drug-involved have been calculated for the 1996 survey of jail
inmates.  These standard errors may be used to construct
confidence intervals around percentages.  For example, the 95%
confidence interval around the percentage of convicted jail
inmates who had active involvement with drugs is approximately
65.5%  plus or minus 1.96 times 0.90% (or 63.7%  to 67.3%).

                         Percent

Actively drug-involved*    65.5       0.90
 
*Convicted inmates only.
 
These standard errors may also be used to test the statistical
significance of the difference between two sample statistics by
pooling the standard errors of the two sample estimates.  For
example, the standard error of the difference between actively
drug-involved inmates on criminal justice status and other
inmates would be 1.90% (or the square root of the sum of the
squared standard errors for each group).  The difference would
be 1.96 times 1.90 (or 3.72%).  Since the observed difference of
13.7% (71.8 minus 58.1%) is greater than 3.72%, the difference
would be considered statistically significant. 

Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ)

Since 1982 the Annual Survey of Jails has provided baseline data
to estimate characteristics of the Nation's jails and jail
inmates.  The reference date for the 1998 survey was June 30.  A
representative sample of jails was based on information from the
1993 Census of jails.  The sample included jails in 795 jail
jurisdictions and 25 multi-jurisdiction jails.

A jurisdiction is a county (parish in Louisiana) or municipal
government that administers one or more local jails.  A
multi-jurisdiction jail is one in which two or more
jurisdictions have a formal agreement to operate the facility.

All of the multi-jurisdiction jails were included in the survey.
The remaining jurisdictions were stratified into two groups: 
jurisdictions with jails authorized to hold juveniles and
jurisdictions with jails holding adults only.  All jails in 204
jurisdictions were included in the survey if in 1993 the
jurisdiction held juveniles and had an average daily population
of 250 or more inmates, or if it held only adults and had an
average daily population of 500 or more.  The other
jurisdictions (591) were selected based on stratified
probability sampling.  The average daily population is the sum
of the number of inmates in jail each day for a year, divided by
the number of days in the year.

Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires.  After followup
telephone calls to nonrespondents, the response rate for the
survey was 100%.

Estimates based on data from the Annual Survey of Jails have
associated sampling errors.  The estimated relative sampling
error for the number of jurisdictions that had a policy to test
inmates on June 30, 1998, was 2.23%  and for staff  2.22%.
