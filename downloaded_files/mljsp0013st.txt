Mortality in Local Jails and State Prisons, 2000–2013 

Margaret Noonan, BJS Statistician 
Harley Rohloff and Scott Ginder, RTI International

For the third consecutive year, the number of inmates who died 
while in the custody of local jails or state prisons 
increased. A total of 4,446 inmates died in 2013, an increase 
of 131 deaths since 2012. The number of deaths in local jails 
and prison decreased an annual average of 2% between 2008 and 
2010.

In 2013, a total of 967 jail inmates died while in the custody 
of local jails. The number of deaths increased from 958 deaths 
in 2012 to 967 in 2013, while the jail population decreased 
4%. As a result, the overall mortality rate in local jails 
increased from 128 per 100,000 jail inmates in 2012 to 135 per 
100,000 in 2013. Suicide and heart disease have been the top 
two causes of death in local jails since 2000 (figure 1). 
Suicide has been the leading cause of death in jails every 
year since 2000. In 2013, a third (34%) of jail inmate deaths 
were due to suicide. The suicide rate increased 14%, from 40 
suicides per 100,000 jail inmates in 2012 to 46 per 100,000 in 
2013.

The number of state prisoner deaths increased 4% in 2013, for 
a total of 3,479 deaths, or an additional 122 deaths since 
2012 (figure 2). From 2001 to 2013, the majority (9 in 10 
deaths) of prisoner deaths were due to illness-related causes. 
Between 2012 and 2013, the overall mortality rate for state 
prisoners increased 3%, from 265 deaths per 100,000 in 2012 to 
274 per 100,000 in 2013. This was the highest mortality rate 
since the collection began in 2000. The mortality rate for 
illness increased 4% between 2012 and 2013, from 234 to 243 
deaths per 100,000 inmates. In 2013, the mortality rates 
increased for the leading causes of illness—heart disease (up 
11%), cancer (up 4%), and liver disease (up 16%), while the 
rates decreased for respiratory diseases (down 12%) or AIDS-
related deaths (down 30%). The rate of AIDS-related deaths in 
state prisons has declined 82% since 2001.

Data in this report were developed from the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics’ (BJS) Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP), 
an annual data collection about inmate deaths in local jails 
and state prisons. The DCRP is the only national statistical 
collection that obtains comprehensive information about deaths 
in adult correctional facilities. The program began collecting 
data from jails in 2000 and from prisons in 2001. This report 
covers deaths occurring in local jails from 2000 to 2013 and 
in state prisons from 2001 to 2013. Statistical tables provide 
information about the causes and circumstances of local jail 
and state prison inmate deaths and present trends by cause of 
death, selected decedent characteristics, and mortality rates 
for jail and prison inmates by state.

***************************
Mortality in local jails
****************************

Cause of death
*****************

* Local jail inmate deaths increased 1%, from 958 deaths in 
2012 to 967 deaths in 2013 (table 1).

* Suicides in local jails increased 9%, from 300 suicides in 
2012 to 327 in 2013.

* Jail inmate deaths due to liver disease decreased 35%, from 
29 deaths in 2012 to 19 in 2013.

* Drug or alcohol intoxication deaths in local jails increased 
23%, from 57 deaths in 2012 to 70 in 2013.

* Illness-related deaths accounted for 50% of all inmate 
deaths in local jails in 2013. Heart disease continued to be 
the leading cause of illness-related inmate deaths in local 
jails in 2013 (table 2).

* Suicide was the leading cause of death in local jails in 
2013 (34% of all jail deaths) and has been the leading cause 
of death in local jails each year since 2000.

* The suicide rate increased from 40 suicides per 100,000 
local jail inmates in 2012 to 46 suicides per 100,000 local 
jail inmates in 2013 (table 3).

Decedent characteristics
**************************

* In 2013, a total of 843 male and 124 female inmates died in 
local jails (table 4).

* The typical jail inmate who died in 2013 was male (87%), 
white (54%), age 35 or older (70%), and in custody for fewer 
than 7 days (40%) (table 5).

* The mortality rate for Hispanics was 135 per 100,000 local 
jail inmates in 2013. Due to changes in measurement, this rate 
should not be compared to rates in previous years (table 6). 
(See Methodology.)

Cause of death and demographics
***********************************

* More than half (60%) of all suicides in jails from 2000 to 
2013 involved inmates who were age 25 to 44 (table 7).

* From 2000 to 2013, the number of male jail inmate deaths 
(12,092) was nearly 8 times the number of female inmate deaths 
(1,630). 

* From 2000 to 2013, the average annual mortality rate for 
male (137 per 100,000) and female (133 per 100,000) jail 
inmates were nearly equal (table 8).

* The mortality rate for suicide among male jail inmates (43) 
was 1.5 times the rate for female inmates (28) from 2000 to 
2013.

* The mortality rate for drug or alcohol intoxication for 
black non-Hispanic (5 per 100,000) and Hispanic (6 per 
100,000) jail inmates was nearly equal from 2000 to 2013, but 
was nearly three times higher for white non-Hispanic jail 
inmates (16 per 100,000).

Facility characteristics
**************************

* Most jails (80%) reported no deaths in 2013. Twice as many 
jails reported a single death (12%) as those reporting 
multiple deaths (6%)(table 9).

* In 2013, approximately a quarter (23%) of the average daily 
jail population was a hold for another jurisdiction (table 
10).

* The mortality rate for jail inmates held for another 
correctional authority (80 per 100,000) was lower than the 
rate for other jail inmates (152 per 100,000).

* In 2013, 23% of all jail inmate deaths occurred in 
California and Texas (table 12).

* The median state-level jail death rate was 140 deaths per 
100,000 local jail inmates in 2013 (table 13).

Rates by cause and decedent characteristics
**********************************************

* The mortality rates for illness among females were higher 
than the rates for males from 2004 to 2012 (appendix table 2).

* The mortality rates for heart disease among males were 
higher than the rates for females every year from 2010 to 2013 
(appendix table 3).

* From 2009 to 2013, the suicide rate increased 23% from 35 
per 100,000 jail inmates to 43 per 100,000 (appendix table 4).

******************************
Mortality in state prisons
******************************

Cause of death
******************

* Deaths in prison increased from 3,357 in 2012 to 3,479 in 
2013, reaching the highest number since the prison data 
collection began in 2001. The total number of deaths increased 
4% between 2012 and 2013 (table 16).

* Illness-related deaths accounted for 89% of all deaths in 
prison in 2013.

** Deaths from liver disease increased 16%, from 304 deaths in 
2012 to 354 deaths in 2013. This was the largest percent 
change observed among illness deaths in prison in 2013.

** Cancer (31%) and heart disease (26%) accounted for more 
than half of all prisoner deaths (table 17).

* The mortality rate increased 3%, from 265 deaths per 100,000 
state prisoners in 2012 to 274 per 100,000 in 2013. Although 
there were some fluctuations in the rates for unnatural deaths 
(e.g., accidents increased while suicides declined), the 
change in the rate for illness (up 4%) accounted for the 
increase in the overall rate (table 18).

Decedent characteristics
****************************

* The 1,966 prisoners age 55 or older made up more than half 
(57%) of all deaths in state prisons in 2013 (table 19).

* In state prisons, the percentage of decedents age 55 or 
older increased by an average of 8% annually since 2001 (table 
20).

* White inmates accounted for more than half (55%) of deaths 
in state prisons, and nearly all (96%) were male (table 21).

* In 2013, an estimated 117,805 (9%) of state prisoners were 
age 55 or older, up from 47,900 (4%) in 2001.

* Combined, deaths due to suicide, drug or alcohol 
intoxication, accidents, and homicide accounted for fewer than 
200 female prisoner deaths between 2001 and 2013 (table 23).

* A third of homicides in state prisons involved prisoners age 
45 or older between 2001 and 2013.

* From 2001 to 2013, male prisoners were twice as likely as 
female prisoners to die of cancer, heart disease, and liver 
disease, which were the leading causes of death in state 
prisons (table 24).

* Regardless of race or Hispanic origin, there was little 
variation in the average annual homicide rate (4 to 6 
homicides per 100,000 state prisoners) for state prisoners 
between 2001 and 2013.

* From 2001 to 2013, prisoners age 55 or older were 3 to 9 
times more likely to die of an accident than younger 
prisoners.

Deaths by jurisdiction
*************************

Every state department of corrections reported at least one 
prisoner death in 2013 (table 25).

* The prisoner death rate by state varied from 115 deaths per 
100,000 to 628 deaths per 100,000 prisoners. The median state-
level death rate among prisoners was 273 deaths per 100,000 
state prisoners (table 26).

Cause of death by state
****************************

* California’s 4,790 prisoner deaths from 2001 to 2013 
represent more than 11% of the total deaths (42,157). During 
this period, almost a third of all state prisoner deaths from 
drug or alcohol intoxication were in California (174 of 546 
deaths) (table 27).

* Overall mortality rates and mortality rates by state and by 
cause of death may not be directly compared between states due 
to differences in age, sex, race or Hispanic origin, and other 
decedent characteristics (table 28).

Rates by cause and decedent characteristics
**********************************************

* The illness mortality rate increased to 269 per 100,000 
prisoners in 2013, up from 262 per 100,000 in 2012 (appendix 
table 6).

* The prisoner cancer mortality rate has increased every year 
between 2008 and 2013 (appendix table 7).

* The prisoner heart disease mortality rate was relatively 
stable between 2003 and 2013, fluctuating between 64 and 67 
deaths per 100,000 prisoner deaths each year (appendix table 
8).

Methodology

Data collection coverage
**************************

The Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP) is an annual 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) data collection. The DCRP 
collects national, state, and incident-level data on persons 
who died while in the physical custody of the 50 state 
departments of corrections or the approximately 2,800 local 
adult jail jurisdictions nationwide. The DCRP began in 2000 
under the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-
297), and it is the only national statistical collection to 
obtain comprehensive information about deaths in adult 
correctional facilities. BJS uses DCRP data to track national 
trends in the number and causes (or manners) of deaths 
occurring in state prison or local jail custody.

Mortality data measured by the DCRP include decedent 
characteristics, such as age, sex, race or Hispanic origin, 
date of admission, conviction status, admission offense, and 
the location and type of facility (prison or jail) where the 
inmate died. The DCRP also collects data about circumstances 
surrounding the death, including the cause, time and location 
where the death occurred, and information on whether an 
autopsy was conducted and the availability of results to the 
respondent. Data on executions are excluded from this report 
but are accessible on the BJS website along with the DCRP 
mortality data. Statistics presented in this report are 
current as of March 1, 2015. For more information on mortality 
in correctional settings, see Mortality in Local Jails, 2000–
2007 (NCJ 222988, BJS web, July 2010); Medical Causes of Death 
in State Prisons, 2001–2004 (NCJ 216340, BJS web, January 
2007); and Suicide and Homicide in State Prisons and Local 
Jails (NCJ 210036, BJS web, August 2005).

The DCRP data collection instruments are administered annually 
to both state prisons and local jails. Respondents provide an 
aggregate count of the number of deaths that occurred during 
the referenced calendar year. The jail (CJ-9) and prison (NPS-
4A) survey instruments used to obtain data on each prison and 
jail death are available on the BJS website at www.bjs.gov.

In addition to the death count, BJS requests that jails 
provide summary statistics about their population and 
admissions. All jails, including those with no deaths to 
report (which includes about 80% of jails in any given year) 
are asked to complete the annual summary survey form. The 2013 
DCRP jail annual summary form was combined with the Census of 
Jails data collection, which gathered facility-level data on 
the jail reporting units. Items such as each facility’s count 
of inmates confined at yearend by race, operating 
expenditures, rated capacity, and number of employed staff 
were new for respondents this year. The instrument used for 
the Census of Jails included 18 questions, which was a 
significant increase compared to the 5-question instrument 
used in the past.

BJS obtains a separate report describing the decedent’s 
characteristics and the circumstances surrounding the death 
for each death that occurred in a state prison or local jail. 
State prison and local jail respondents can submit individual 
records on decedents at any time during a collection cycle 
through a BJS web-based collection system.

BJS has modified the survey instruments slightly over time, 
including changes to clarify questions and ease the burden on 
respondents. Several questions were added to capture 
information on any medical treatment that the inmate received 
prior to death. Changes also allowed respondents to elaborate 
on cause of death by adding text boxes to the intoxication, 
suicide, and inmate-involved homicide death questions. 
Previously, these fields had only been available for deaths 
due to illness, accident, homicides not caused by other 
inmates, and other unspecified causes. In addition, BJS 
clarified respondent instructions on the prison forms and 
removed a question collecting the conviction status of an 
inmate after an analysis showed that more than 99% of prison 
inmates were convicted at the time of death. BJS also 
streamlined the survey layout to simplify the progression 
through questions related to autopsies. Rather than initially 
submitting an incomplete instrument that indicated pending 
autopsy results, respondents were only permitted to complete 
the entire survey after autopsy results were available. This 
change reduced follow-up contact and the burden on 
respondents.

Starting in 2001 and annually thereafter, BJS has collected 
DCRP data directly from state prison systems, maintaining a 
100% response rate.

Nonresponse
***************
The jail universe includes all jails currently operating and 
jails that have been contacted for the DCRP but have closed, 
consolidated, or otherwise eliminated operations. This 
universe allows BJS to determine jail participation in the 
DCRP. The most recent jail universe, constructed in January 
2015, identified 2,870 jurisdictions representing 3,170 jail 
facilities. Of these, 2,703 jurisdictions (94.2%) participated 
in the DCRP.

A jail jurisdiction is a legal entity that has responsibility 
for managing jail facilities. Jail jurisdictions typically 
operate at the county level, in which a sheriff’s office or 
jail administrator manages the local facilities. The DCRP data 
identify the jail facility in which a jail inmate dies, but 
the data are arrayed at the jail jurisdiction level. BJS 
defines a jail as a locally operated correctional facility 
that confines persons before or after adjudication for more 
than 72 hours, excluding temporary lockups. Typically, there 
is one facility per jail jurisdiction, but the 2013 Census of 
Jails found that 6.7% of jail jurisdictions had multiple 
facilities under a central authority *** Footnote 1 
Approximately 15% of all facilities were part of a 
multifacility jurisdiction.*** (See the BJS website for more 
information.)

Determining eligibility for reporting to the DCRP
***************************************************

In the DCRP, custody refers to the holding of an inmate in a 
facility or to the period during which a correctional 
authority maintains a chain of custody over an inmate. For 
instance, if a jail transports an ill inmate to a hospital for 
medical services and that inmate dies while in the chain of 
custody of the jail, then that death is counted as a death in 
custody. A death that occurs when an inmate is not in the 
custody of a correctional authority is considered beyond the 
scope of the DCRP. Out-of-scope deaths include inmates on 
escape status or under the supervision of community 
corrections on probation, parole, or home-electronic 
monitoring. BJS instructs both state prison and local jail 
officials to determine whether the inmate was in the physical 
custody of the jurisdiction at the time of death, regardless 
of the reason an inmate was being held. For state prisons 
responding to the survey, inmates in physical custody include 
those held in any private prison facility under contract to 
the responding state’s department of corrections or in any of 
their state-operated facilities, including halfway houses, 
prison camps or farms, training or treatment centers, and 
prison hospitals.

BJS instructs state prison officials to exclude deaths of 
inmates who were transferred to local jails while still 
serving a prison term because the DCRP obtains information 
about such deaths through the jail reports. Jail inmate 
custody includes inmates who are temporarily out of the jail 
facility but are within the chain of custody of the jail. For 
example, a death in custody would include a jail inmate who 
died after being transferred to an offsite facility that cares 
for critically ill persons. From 2000 to 2013, the DCRP data 
have shown that about 84% of jail deaths occurring in medical 
facilities have occurred outside of the jail facility.

Custody is further complicated by the dual law enforcement and 
jail administration functions of some sheriffs’ offices. As a 
result, some deaths reported as jail deaths actually occurred 
before the jail had custody of the decedent. BJS identifies 
and excludes from the DCRP these deaths that occurred in the 
process of arrest by using information about the circumstances 
surrounding the death.

Identifying and excluding duplicate records
**********************************************

Duplicate death records may occur in the DCRP due to 
overlapping correctional populations and overlapping duties 
within correctional facilities. For example, a jail 
jurisdiction may have more than one unit responsible for 
reporting data to BJS, a jail may be holding a state prison 
inmate, or state prison systems may report the death of an 
inmate who was transferred to a local jail but was serving a 
prison sentence at the time.

To identify duplicate death records, BJS reconciles the 
aggregate summary counts of deaths occurring during a calendar 
year with the number of individual death records obtained from 
a reporting jurisdiction. When discrepancies are identified, 
BJS contacts reporting jurisdictions to clarify matters. 
However, even if summary counts and individual reports are 
reconciled, duplicate death records may exist if multiple 
reporting units within a jurisdiction provide reconciled data.

Duplicate records occur primarily in reports from jail 
jurisdictions that have multiple reporting entities. To 
identify duplicate records, BJS performs record-matching based 
on inmate name and date of birth, date of death, and date of 
admission into a correctional facility. After the aggregate 
count review, BJS searches for deaths reported to both the 
jail and prison DCRP collections, which most commonly occur 
when a local jail is housing an inmate for the state 
department of corrections. The death is considered part of the 
count of the facility that had custody of the inmate at the 
time of death, and the duplicate record is deleted.

Duplicate and out-of-scope records are excluded from the 
analyses.

Cause-of-death information
********************************

The instructions for completing the DCRP tell respondents to 
report death information as determined by an autopsy or other 
official medical death investigation. For this collection, 
intoxication deaths, accidents, suicides, and homicides are 
considered discrete causes of death. Although there is a 
distinction between manner and cause of death from a medico-
legal standpoint, no such distinction is made in the DCRP. 
When reporting a death due to illness, accident, suicide, 
intoxication, or homicide, BJS requests that respondents 
describe the events surrounding these deaths.

Clinical data specialists convert illness-related death text 
entries into standard medical codes according to the World 
Health Organization’s International Statistical Classification 
of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-
10).

Homicides include all types of intentional homicide and 
involuntary manslaughter as ruled by a medical examiner or 
pathologist at autopsy. For example, an inmate may die of 
positional asphyxia (suffocation caused by the position of the 
inmate’s body) while the inmate is being removed from a cell. 
A legal-intervention homicide committed while the inmate is 
trying to escape would also be included. In addition, 
homicides include cases that are ruled a homicide at autopsy 
when events that led to the death occurred prior to 
incarceration. For example, an inmate who was shot in the 
community years prior to incarceration died from complications 
of the gunshot wound while incarcerated.

Other BJS sources of correctional mortality data
**************************************************

BJS collects other data reported to the DCRP on correctional 
mortality. These other collections include --

* Capital Punishment, which provides data on legal executions. 
Further discussion on executions is available on the BJS 
website.

* The National Prisoner Statistics (NPS), which annually 
collected aggregate counts of deaths in state and federal 
prisons prior to the establishment of the DCRP. Prior to 2007, 
the NPS also collected counts of deaths by cause of death, 
including deaths due to execution, illness, AIDS, suicide, 
accident, homicide, and other causes. After 2006, the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons continued to submit the counts of deaths by 
cause of death using the DCRP, but no longer provided counts 
of deaths using the NPS. Further discussion of the NPS is 
available on the BJS website.

* The Census of Jails, conducted every 5 to 6 years, provides 
counts of inmate deaths in local jails. Further discussion of 
the Census of Jails is available on the BJS website.

* The Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC), which provides 
aggregate counts of the number of deaths occurring in all 
known Indian country correctional facilities operated by 
tribal authorities or the U.S. Department of the Interior’s 
Bureau of Indian Affairs. Further discussion of the SJIC is 
available on the BJS website.

Reported statistics
************************

Mortality data are shown in statistical tables by type of 
correctional institution (state prisons and local jails) and 
include the number of deaths and mortality rates by year, 
cause of death, selected decedent characteristics, and state.

Mortality rates are calculated per 100,000 inmates, with the 
denominators providing estimates of the number of person-years 
of exposure in custody in institutional corrections. Until 
2010, the mortality rate for state prisons was calculated as 
the number of deaths per year divided by the midyear state 
prison population in custody multiplied by 100,000. Starting 
in 2011, the rate was calculated using yearend custody counts 
because midyear populations were no longer available. Custody 
counts for state prisons provide estimates of person-years for 
prison populations. BJS uses data from the NPS to provide 
midyear and yearend custody counts of prisoners. For more 
information on the NPS, see the BJS website.

The mortality rate in local jails is calculated as the number 
of deaths per year divided by the jail inmate average daily 
population (ADP) multiplied by 100,000. The ADP for local 
jails is defined as the average daily number of jail inmates 
held in a jail jurisdiction during a calendar year, from 
January 1 through December 31.

The ADP is used as the denominator for jail mortality rates to 
accommodate the high turnover and daily fluctuation in local 
jail populations. Also, the ADP better reflects the number of 
inmate days per year than a 1-day count. Jail populations have 
a higher turnover than prison populations; mean length of stay 
in local jails is about 21 days, compared to 2 years in state 
prisons.

The jail ADP also reflects the annual number of admissions and 
mean length of stay, and can be expressed as the product of 
these two values. When mean length of stay is expressed in 
years, the ADP is equivalent to the number of person-years 
spent by jail inmates during a given year. BJS obtains the 
jail ADP data directly from jails through the DCRP using the 
summary form CJ-9A. Starting in 2002, BJS collected the ADP 
directly from respondents. Prior to 2002, BJS calculated the 
jail ADP by taking the average of the January 1 count from the 
prior year and the December 31 count from the reference year, 
which is an appropriate proxy measure for the ADP.

Both denominators provide for annualizing mortality rates, 
which are calculated separately by group or by characteristic. 
The annualized mortality rates in state prisons and local 
jails are comparable to annual crude mortality rates reported 
by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

The NCHS calculates crude mortality rates as the number of 
events for a period (e.g., a year) divided by the population 
estimate at the midpoint of the period. For general population 
mortality statistics, the NCHS employs the midyear population 
as an approximation to the average population exposed to risk 
of death during any given year*** Footnote 2 See Siegal, J. & 
Swanson, D. (2004). The Methods and Materials of Demography, 
Second Edition. San Diego, CA: Elsevier Academic Press, 
269***.

The crude mortality rates reported in the DCRP annual 
statistical tables are not directly comparable to the crude 
mortality rates within the (nonincarcerated) general 
population, and the crude mortality rates in state prisons are 
not directly comparable to those of local jails. The 
composition of the general population (i.e., age, sex, and 
race or Hispanic origin) differs from the population in state 
prisons and local jails. Because mortality is correlated with 
age, sex, and race or Hispanic origin, the crude mortality 
rates in state prisons, local jails, and the general 
population should not be compared.

Individual inmate death records collected annually in the 
death file are included in the national death count. 
Independent jail-specific summary death counts are collected 
in the annual summary form (CJ-9A or CJ-10A) and serve as 
control death totals. If the death count in the summary form 
file is greater than the count in the individual inmate death 
file, the summary file count is used as the total in 
calculating a jail mortality rate. For 2013, individual 
records for jail inmate deaths were adjusted to match 
independent counts of deaths occurring in each jail, and the 
mortality rates were adjusted accordingly.

Estimating inmate population characteristics 
to calculate mortality rates by demographic subgroups
*********************************************************

BJS does not obtain annual data for all demographic 
characteristics of prison and jail inmates in all 
jurisdictions. BJS uses data from sources other than the DCRP 
to estimate the nationwide composition of state prison and 
local jail inmate populations by age, sex, and race or 
Hispanic origin. These data sources consist primarily of 
periodic surveys of inmates in custody in prisons and jails. 
The inmate characteristic distributions obtained from these 
surveys are applied to denominators (i.e., counts of inmates 
or ADP) to estimate the number of inmates in each demographic 
subgroup.

BJS estimated the demographic distribution of the state prison 
population data from the NPS and National Corrections 
Reporting Program (NCRP) collections. For a discussion on the 
methodology for obtaining state prisoner distribution 
estimates by age, sex, and race or Hispanic origin, see 
Prisoners in 2012 (NCJ 243920, BJS web, December 2013).

Prior to using the NPS and NCRP to estimate demographic 
distributions, reports of mortality rates for state prison 
inmates used demographic distributions derived from BJS’s 2004 
Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities 
(SISFCF). As a result, the state prison mortality rates shown 
in these tables may differ from previously published rates. A 
rate comparison between the two sources showed very little 
difference in the resultant mortality rates. In most 
instances, the rates either matched or nearly matched. The 
rates differed in only three instances: Hispanics in 2001, and 
females and inmates age 55 or older in 2002. In each instance, 
the rates calculated using population data from the NCRP and 
NPS were slightly higher (less than a 1% increase) than rates 
calculated using population data from the SISFCF.

To estimate inmate demographic characteristic distributions of 
the ADP, BJS used data from several surveys to generate 
distributions of age, sex, and race or Hispanic origin and 
applied these distributions to the ADP. BJS’s Annual Survey of 
Jails (ASJ) provided estimates of the sex distribution of 
inmates for each year of the DCRP collection and applied these 
to each year’s ADP from the DCRP to estimate the ADP of male 
and female jail inmates. Jail Inmates at Midyear 2010 - 
Statistical Tables (NCJ 233431, BJS web, April 2011) documents 
that the distributions of inmate characteristics have changed 
slowly over time. For the most recent information on the ASJ, 
see the BJS website.

To estimate the distribution of race and Hispanic origin of 
adult jail inmates, BJS used data from the Survey of Inmates 
in Local Jails (SILJ), the National Inmate Survey (NIS), and 
the Census of Jails to estimate the relative distribution of 
adults by race and Hispanic origin for different periods. 
Because the SILJ (2002), the NIS (2007 to 2009), and the 
Census of Jails (2013) are not fielded annually, the 
population estimates were smoothed before being applied to 
DCRP data. BJS used the SILJ estimates to cover the period 
from 2000 to 2004, the NIS estimates to cover the period from 
2005 to 2012, and the Census of Jails to cover 2013. In all 
cases, the percentages associated with the distribution of 
race and Hispanic origin were applied to the adult jail ADP. 
For more information about jail inmates in 2002, see Profile 
of Jail Inmates, 2002 (NCJ 201932, BJS web, July 2004).

To estimate the age distribution of the jail inmate 
population, BJS first obtained an estimate of the number of 
jail inmates age 17 or younger from the 2013 Census of Jails 
data collection. By applying the annual percentage of jail 
inmates age 17 or younger to the annual ADP, BJS obtained an 
estimate of the ADP of jail inmates age 17 or younger.

To estimate the age distribution of adult jail inmates, BJS 
used data from the SILJ for 2000 to 2006 and the NIS for 2007 
to 2013 to estimate the relative distribution of adults by age 
category for different periods. The age estimates were 
smoothed to account for gaps in reference years when age 
estimates were available, specifically for 2003, 2006, 2010, 
and 2011.

Moving averages
******************

Moving averages were used to smooth short-term irregularities 
and to estimate long-term trends. For instance, moving 
averages were computed to examine data trends for certain 
causes of death in jails and prisons while smoothing short-
term fluctuations. The data were cut into several 3-year 
overlapping periods spanning 13 years of prison data and 14 
years of jail data.

The moving averages in this report describe some changes in 
cause-specific mortality rates over time (e.g., whether the 
overall decline in the AIDS-related mortality rate was steady, 
or whether the increase of suicides in jails was recent). 
Moving averages were not computed for all causes of death in 
custody because the resultant rates would have been unstable 
and therefore statistically meaningless due to small cell 
sizes.

Random error and suppression
******************************

The DCRP data on deaths in state prisons and local jails are 
not subject to sampling error. However, mortality data from a 
complete or near-complete enumeration may be subject to random 
error. Following the methodology of Brillinger ***Footnote 3 
See Brillinger, D.R. (1986). The Natural Variability of Vital 
Rates and Associated Statistics. Biometrics, 42, 693–
734.***and NCHS, “the number of deaths that actually occurred 
may be considered as one of a large series of possible results 
that could have arisen under the same set of 
circumstances***Footnote 4 See Xu, J. et al. (2010). Deaths: 
Final Data for 2007. National Vital Statistics
Report, 58(19). Retrieved from 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr58/
nvsr58_19.pdf.*** The random variation can be large when the 
number of deaths is small. Therefore, caution is warranted 
when interpreting statistics based on small numbers of deaths. 
According to NCHS standards, mortality rates based on fewer 
than 100 deaths per year should be interpreted with caution.

Continuing to use the NCHS and Brillinger methods, BJS 
quantified random variation by assuming that the appropriate 
underlying probability distribution for the number of deaths 
is a Poisson distribution. This provides a computationally 
simple and reasonable approach for estimating variances in 
mortality statistics when the probability of dying is low. BJS 
calculated variances based on the assumption of a Poisson 
process. From these variances, BJS calculated relative random 
error estimates, which are comparable to relative standard 
error in that the relative random error is the ratio of random 
error derived from the Poisson variance to the number of 
deaths. Following NCHS, when the relative random error 
exceeded 30%, BJS flagged estimated mortality rates due to the 
instability of the rate with a “!” symbol (Interpret with 
caution; too few sample cases to provide a reliable rate).

Survey performance issues
**************************

Survey administration and modifications to the survey form 
generated data from 2007 to 2009 that may not be wholly 
compatible with prior DCRP data. In 2012, BJS identified a 
previously undetected data error that mischaracterized more 
than 600 illness-related deaths as illness-related deaths 
missing detailed cause-of-death information. The data error 
led to an inflated frequency of prison deaths in reference 
year 2007 being characterized as all other illnesses while 
simultaneously depressing frequencies of known illnesses 
(e.g., heart disease, cancer, and liver disease). The error 
was identified and resolved, correcting the distributions. In 
2008, local jail officials were unable to provide causes of 
death for 21.4% of jail inmate deaths. During 2009, BJS made 
modifications to the collection instruments to improve 
reporting and reduce burden.

* Item nonresponse in 2008 jail data and unknown cause of 
death: An abnormally large number of cases were missing a 
response for cause of death in the 2008 jail file (n = 203; 
21.4% of all jail deaths in 2008). This coincided with the 
final year the U.S. Census Bureau acted as the data collection 
agent for the DCRP. In prior years of the DCRP jail data 
collection, an average of 6% of all causes of death were 
classified as other or unknown. For this report, BJS 
categorized all 203 jail deaths from 2008 as missing data 
about cause of death.

* 2009 data collection: Prior to fielding the 2009 DCRP 
collection, BJS reviewed the data collection instrument and 
data submission procedures and assessed the communications 
with DCRP respondents to reduce the burden on respondents. The 
survey was modified to facilitate navigation and to encourage 
online response. The modifications led to delays in 
implementing data collection. As a result, death reports were 
not collected in the year the deaths occurred, but were 
instead collected retrospectively during 2010 for the first 
time. Data collection for subsequent years resumed on a normal 
schedule.

* Hispanic origin: In 2013, the death record form was altered 
to collect a two-question format regarding ethnicity and race. 
If Hispanic was selected, the decedent was classified as 
Hispanic regardless of what was selected for race.
