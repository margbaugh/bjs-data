Data from the National Crime Victimization Surveys (NCVS) for
1992-96 indicate that during each year U.S. residents
experienced more than 2 million violent victimizations while
they were working or on duty.  The most common type of workplace
violent crime was simple assault with an estimated average of
1.5 million victimizations occurring each year.  While at work
U.S. residents also suffered 395,000 aggravated assaults, 51,000
rapes and sexual assaults, 84,000 robberies, and 1,000
homicides.

* Each year between 1992 and 1996, more than 2 million U.S.
residents were victims of a violent crime while they were at
work or on duty.

* More than 1,000 workplace homicides occurred annually. 

* The most common type of workplace victimization was simple
assault with an estimated 1.4 million occurring each year.  U.S.
residents also suffered  51,000 rapes and sexual assaults and
about 84,000 robberies while they were at work.

* Annually, more than 230,000 police officers became victims of
a nonfatal violent crime while they were working or on duty.

* About 40% of victims of nonfatal violence in the workplace
reported that they knew their offenders.

* Women were more likely than men to be victimized by someone
they knew.

* Approximately 12% of the nonfatal violent workplace crimes
resulted in an injury to the victim.  Of those injured, 
about half received medical treatment.

* Intimates (current and former spouses, boyfriends, and
girlfriends) were identified by the victims as the perpetrators
of about 1% of all workplace violent crime.

Workplace violence
------------------

In this report workplace violence is defined as violent acts
against a person at work or on duty, including physical assaults
(rape and sexual assault and aggravated and simple assault) and
robbery.  Attempts are included with completed victimizations.
(See Definitions on pages 7-8 for explanations of each offense.)
The phrases at work and on duty are used synonymously for the
term workplace.

While this report is mainly concerned with nonfatal violence as
measured by the NCVS, data from the Bureau of  Labor Statistics
and the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) are included as a
supplement to describe the nature and scope of workplace
homicide.  UCR data on commercial robberies are also included.
Unless otherwise noted as including homicide, all tables only
describe nonfatal workplace violence.

The amount and nature of violent crime in the workplace
-------------------------------------------------------

Each year from 1992 to 1996, more than 2 million U.S. residents
experienced a violent crime victimization while they were
working or on duty (table 1).  The most common type of
victimization was assault, with an estimated 1.5 million simple
assaults and 396,000 aggravated assaults reported annually. 
Each year there were 84,000 robberies, about 51,000 rapes or
sexual assaults, and more than 1,000 workplace homicides.

Victim characteristics
----------------------

Among people victimized while working or on duty, male victims
outnumbered females by about 2 to 1 (table 2). Nearly 9 in 10 of 
victims of workplace violence were white. Fewer than 10% of the 
workplace violence victims were black.  About 70% of the victims 
were between ages 25 and 49, and fewer than 10% of the victims were
over age 50.

of robbery and simple and aggravated assault.

More than half of the violent crime victimizations happened to
individuals who worked for a private employer (table 3).  While
government employees make up approximately 16% of the U.S.
workforce, about 37% of the victims of workplace violence were
employed by a Federal, State, or county government organization.

Annually about 430,000 of the workplace violence victims
identifying their occupation stated they were employed by a
government law enforcement agency or private security
organization (table 4). Among these, an estimated 234,000 police
officers and 71,100 private security guards were victims of
workplace violent crime each year.  The  victimization of law
enforcement officers accounts for the over representation of
government employees as workplace violence victims.

------------------------------------------------

Annually, 330,000 retail sales workers became victims of
workplace violence. These included an estimated 61,000
convenience/liquor store clerks and 26,000 bartenders.  More
than 160,000 workers in the medical occupations including an
estimated 70,000 nurses, 24,000 technicians, and about 10,000
physicians were victimized each year.

Teachers accounted for about 149,000 of all workplace
victimizations each year.  An estimated 33,000 high school,
35,000 elementary, and 47,000 junior high/middle school teachers
were victims of a violent crime while working or on duty.  

Of the occupations examined, law enforcement had the highest
rates of workplace violence while teaching had the lowest.
Police officers experienced 306 victimizations for every 1,000
officers; corrections officers in prisons or jails, 218 per 1,000.  
College or university teaching was the occupation with the lowest 
rate of violence at work:  2.5 per 1,000 teachers.

How often victims were assaulted at work was related to their
occupation (table 5).  Public law enforcement and private
security workers experienced the most workplace assaults each
year -- an estimated 327,000 simple assaults and nearly 100,000
aggravated assaults.  Transportation workers suffered the fewest
assaults -- an estimated 45,000 simple assaults and 17,000
aggravated assaults.

Assaults on police

Both the NCVS and the UCR recorded recent decreases in the
number of nonfatal assaults on police (figure 1).  In 1996 
police officers reported to the NCVS about 152,000 assaults, 
and agencies reported 47,000 such assaults to the UCR.

-----------------------------------------------

The higher levels in the NCVS data are partially attributable to
the survey's recording assaults that victimized officers did not
report to their superiors.  These were possibly the less serious
assaults in which officers were not injured:  87% of all
assaults did not result in an injury.  The difference between
the UCR and the NCVS data is less distinct when comparing
assaults on police officers resulting in injury --
victimizations that officers may be more prone to report to
their superiors.

Response to workplace violence
-------------------------------

When confronted by the offender, about 27% of the workplace
violence victims did not resist (table 6).  The most common
reaction of victims was   nonconfrontational actions such as
trying to stall, persuade, or bargain with the offender, or
fleeing or hiding from the offender.  Fewer than 4% of the
victims resisted with a weapon.

Victims of certain types of violent crime, however, sustained a
slightly, though not statistically significant, higher incidence
of injury.  Victims of rape or sexual assault suffered
additional injury in 19% of the reported victimizations (table
7).  About 17% of victims of robbery or aggravated assault were
injured, compared to 10% of victims of simple assault.

The relationship between the victim and the offender may be of
special interest with crime that occurs in the workplace.  In
addition to strangers, workplace crime has been in part
attributed to disgruntled current or former employees and
domestic disputes involving intimates (current and former
spouses, boyfriends and girlfriends).

The majority of all workplace violent crime was committed by a
stranger to the victim (table 8).  A higher percentage of men
(66%) than women (47%) were victimized by a stranger. Intimates
were identified as the perpetrators in fewer than 1% of all
incidents of workplace violence.  Female victims reported that
their attackers were intimates in about 2% of all offenses.
Female victims were also more likely  than male victims to
report that their attackers were acquaintances (46%, compared to
30%).

one offender (table 9).  About 11% of the rapes and 9% of the
simple assaults involved multiple offenders.

Those who committed workplace violence were predominately male,
white, and older than 21 (table 10).  Among workplace crimes for
which victims reported just one perpetrator, more than 80% of
the offenders were males, 58% were white, and 47% were over age
30.

About 20% of violent incidents in the workplace involved an
armed offender (table 11).  A firearm was used in fewer than 10%
of all workplace violent crimes.  The likelihood of a victim's
being threatened or injured by an armed offender reflected the
vulnerability of the victim's occupation (table 12).  One in
three incidents of violence against transportation workers were
committed by an offender who had a gun, knife, or other weapon.
One in four retail sales workers reported that the offender was
armed during the incidents they experienced.  Of those incidents
examined, medical care workers faced an armed offender in 7% of
violent crimes.

Outcomes
--------

Fewer than half of all nonfatal violent workplace crimes were
reported to the police (table 13).  Male victims (47%) were more
likely than female victims (38%) to report the offense to the
police. About 25% of the rapes and sexual assaults were reported
to the police while nearly 73% of the robberies were reported.
An injured victim was more likely than an uninjured victim to
report the crime to the police.  Sixty percent of the injured
victims, but 42% of the uninjured, reported the offense to the
police.  About 61% of the victimizations committed by an
intimate of the victim (spouse/ex-spouse or boy/girlfriend) were
reported to the police.

When questioned about why they did not report the offense,
workplace violence victims gave as their most common reason that
they reported it to another official (29%).  This other official
may have been a supervisor or the security personnel of the
organization for which they worked.  Another 19% stated that the
violence was not important enough to report to the police.

Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that homicide
was the second leading cause of death in the workplace between
1992 and 1996 (figure 3) with more than 1,000 murders occurring
each year. The work-place homicides accounted for about 1 of
every 6 fatal occupational injuries.

Firearms were used to commit more than 80 percent of all
workplace homicides between 1992 and 1996. About 20 percent of
the homicides were the result of bombings, stabbings, or
beatings.  This figure includes the deaths of employees among
the 168 who died in the 1995 bombing of the Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City.

From 1993 to 1996 males were the majority of workplace homicide
victims (table 15).  Each year an average of 710 whites and 191
blacks were murdered while working.  About 143 workplace
homicide victims each year were of Hispanic origin.  Most
workplace homicide victims were between ages 25 and 44.

Between 1993 and 1996 most workplace homicides -- an average of
nearly 760 each year -- were the result of a robbery (figure 4).
About 100 workplace homicides a year were attributed to the
victim's coworkers or customers.  Personal acquaintances of
homicide victims were identified as perpetrators in about 
50 workplace murders each year.

Methodology
-----------

Except as noted, the data for this report come from the 1992 to
1996 National Crime Victimization Surveys (NCVS).  The NCVS is
an annual survey of about 46,000 households and 95,000
individuals age 12 or older.  It obtains information about
crimes, including those not reported to the police, from a
continuous, nationally representative sample of households in
the United States.

Respondents who reported that they were a victim of a violent
crime while working or on duty represent the sample for this
report.  This sample does not include those crime victims who
stated that they were on their way to or from work.  Customers
affected by violence at a workplace also were not included in
the analysis.  Because the NCVS does not measure murder, the
homicide data included in this report were drawn from the FBI's
Uniform Crime Reports and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  While
some trends are presented, most data are presented in the
aggregate.  Using aggregate data from 5 years for this report
makes possible more reliable estimates. 

The estimates in this report are not directly comparable to
those in Violence and Theft in the Workplace (BJS Crime Data
Brief, NCJ 148199, July 1994).  The differences reflect changes
in survey methodology introduced by the 1992 redesign of the
NCVS.

Research prior to the redesign indicated that a substantial
proportion of certain types of crimes were not recounted.  In
general, the redesigned survey gives respondents additional cues
to encourage recall of eligible crime events.  These changes
achieved the intended effect of producing higher and more
accurate estimates of violent crime than had resulted from the
previously used procedures.  For a detailed explanation, see
Effects of the Redesign on Victimization Estimates (BJS
Technical Report, NCJ 164381, April 1997).

Definitions

Aggravated assault:  Attack or attempted attack with a weapon,
regardless of whether or not an injury occurred and attack
without a weapon when serious injury occurs.

Simple assault:  Attack without a weapon resulting either in no
injury, minor injury, or in undetermined injury requiring less
than 2 days of hospitalization. Also includes attempted assault
without a weapon.

Robbery:  Completed or attempted theft, directly from a person,
of property or cash by force or threat, with or without a
weapon, and with or without injury.

Rape:  Forced sexual intercourse including both psychological
coercion as well as physical force. Includes attempted rapes,
male as well as female victims, and both heterosexual and
homosexual rape.

Sexual assault:  A wide range of victimizations, separate from
rape or attempted rape. These crimes include attacks or
attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual contact
between victim and offender. Sexual assault also includes verbal
threats. 

Intimates:  Includes spouses, ex-spouses and current and former
boyfriends and girlfriends. The relationship is defined by 
the respondent.

Acquaintances:  Includes friends, former friends, roommates or
boarders, schoolmates, neighbors, someone at work, or some other
known non-relative.

Relatives:  Includes parents and step-parents, children and
stepchildren, siblings and other relatives. 

Stranger:  Someone not known to the victim.

Rounding of percentages

Percentages in the tables may not add to 100% because of
rounding.

Computation of standard errors

The results in this report were tested to determine if the
observed differences between groups were statistically
significant. 

The comparisons made in this report were tested to determine
whether the observed differences between groups or over time
were statistically significant.  Comparisons mentioned in the report
passed a hypothesis test at the 0.05 level of statistical
significane (or the 95-percent confidence level.)  This means
that the estimated difference between comparisons was greater than
twice the standard error of that difference.

The standard error calculations were made using statistical
programs specifically developed for the NCVS  by the U.S. Bureau
of the Census. These programs take into account the complex
sample design of the NCVS when calculating the generalized
variance estimates.

Though 5 years of data are covered in this report, some
estimates were based on relatively small numbers.  This is noted
in tables where estimates are based on 10 or fewer sample cases.
Because standard errors cannot be accurately computed for such
estimates, it is not advisable to compare them to other
estimates. Caution should also be used when comparing estimates
not specifically mentioned in the text of this report. Large
differences may not be statistically significant at even the
90-percent confidence level.
