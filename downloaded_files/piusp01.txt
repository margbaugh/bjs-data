Highlights

At yearend 2001 over 5.6 million U.S. adults had ever 
served time in State or Federal prison

*  Of adults in 2001 who had ever served time in prison, 
nearly as many were black (2,166,000) as were white
(2,203,000). An estimated 997,000 were Hispanic.

*  The rate of ever having gone to prison among adult 
black males(16.6%) was over twice as high as among adult 
Hispanic males (7.7%) and over 6 times as high as among 
adult white males (2.6%).

*  U.S. residents ages 35 to 39 in 2001 were more likely 
to have gone to prison (3.8%) than any other age group, 
up from 2.3% in 1991.

*  An estimated 22% of black males ages 35 to 44 in 2001 
had ever been confined in State or Federal prison, compared 
to 10.0% of Hispanic males and 3.5% of white males in the 
same age group.  

If incarceration rates remain unchanged, 6.6% 
of U.S. residents born in 2001 will go to prison 
at some time during their lifetime

*  About 1 in 3 black males, 1 in 6 Hispanic males, and 1 in 
17 white males are expected to go to prison during their 
lifetime, if current incarceration rates remain unchanged.

*  For women, the chances of going to prison were 6 times 
greater in 2001 (1.8%) than in 1974 (0.3%); for men, the
chances of going to prison were over 3 times greater in 
2001 (11.3%) than in 1974 (3.6%).
----------------------------------------------

At yearend 2001 there were 1,319,000 adults confined in 
State or Federal prison and an estimated 4,299,000
living former prisoners. A total of 5,618,000 U.S. adult 
residents, or about 1 in every 37 U.S. adults, had ever
served time in prison. Estimates of the prevalence of 
imprisonment in the U.S. population, presented here for 
the first time, are based on a demographic model 
incorporating rates of mortality and first incarceration 
in prison.

Between 1974 and 2001, the prevalence of imprisonment 
increased by nearly 3.8 million. This included a 1.1
million increase in the number of adults in prison (up 
from 216,000) and a nearly 2.7 million increase in the 
number of living former prisoners (up from 1,603,000).

If rates of first incarceration remain unchanged, 6.6% of 
all persons born in the United States in 2001 will go to 
State or Federal prison during their lifetime, up from 
5.2% in 1991, and 1.9% in 1974. Unlike the prevalence of
ever having gone to prison, which estimates the extent 
of past experiences, the lifetime likelihood of going to 
prison is an estimate of the chances of future 
incarceration, given unchanged rates of first 
incarceration and mortality.

4.3 million U.S. residents in 2001
were former prisoners      

Of the estimated 5.6 million adults in the United States 
who had been incarcerated in State or Federal prison at 
some time before yearend 2001, nearly 4.3 million were no 
longer in prison. Former prisoners accounted for 77% of 
all adult residents who had ever been confined in prison.

Persons ages 35 to 44 comprised the largest age group, 
accounting for 3 out of 10 former prisoners at yearend 
2001 (1,280,000). Former prisoners were older than those 
currently in State or Federal prison, with 49% of former 
prisoners age 45 or older compared to 13% of persons 
confined on December 31, 2001. Current prisoners
outnumbered former prisoners only among those ages 18 to 
24 (254,000 compared with 155,000).   

More than two-thirds of former
prisoners no longer under
correctional supervision

At yearend 2001 former prisoners included 731,147 
persons on parole, an estimated 437,000 persons on
probation who had either served part of their current 
sentence in prison or been confined in prison on a 
previous sentence, and an estimated 166,000 jail
inmates who had served a previous sentence in prison. 
An estimated 3 million former prisoners were no longer
under correctional supervision as of yearend 2001.

------------------------------------------------
Demographic techniques used to
create prevalence estimates

Estimates of the prevalence of ever having gone to 
prison were derived from generation life table 
techniques. The prevalence of ever having gone to
prison includes adults currently in prison and living 
former prisoners.  

One-day counts of the number of adults in prison are 
available through the National Prisoner Statistics 
program (NPS). Collected annually since 1926, the NPS 
provides a count at yearend of persons held in Federal 
and State prisons.

To obtain the number of persons who had ever gone to
prison, separate generation life tables were prepared 
for persons alive between 1974 and 2001. These tables 
model the first incarceration and mortality experience
of each birth cohort as it proceeded through life. 
Estimates were made of the number of persons going to 
prison for the first time, by year of age, and the
number who had been incarcerated and survived to each 
later age.

Rates of first incarceration during a 12-month period 
were developed from prison inmate surveys conducted in
1974, 1979, 1986, 1991, and 1997, a period during which 
admission rates increased after many years of relative 
stability. 

Prevalence estimates for selected calendar years represent 
a sum of the contribution of each birth cohort to the total 
number of adults alive who had ever gone to prison. The 
number of former prisoners was obtained by subtracting the 
number of prisoners at yearend (NPS) from the total.  

Estimates exclude admissions to local jails, due to the 
absence of data needed to calculate first admissions to 
jail. (See Methodology for estimation procedures and 
limitations.)
---------------------------------------------

1 in 37 adult U.S. residents in 2001
had ever served time in prison

The 5.6 million adult U.S. residents who were current 
and former prisoners, represented an increase of 3.8 
million since 1974. At yearend 2001, 2,673 persons per 
100,000 adult U.S. residents had ever gone to prison, 
up from 1,251 per 100,000 adult residents in 1974. 
Overall, approximately 1 in 37 adult residents in 2001 
had ever served time in a State or Federal prison.

As a percent of all adults who had ever gone to a State 
or Federal prison, the number of former prisoners has 
steadily declined (from 88% in 1974 to 77% in 2001). 
The decline occurred as the number of adults confined 
in prison at yearend grew by 1.1 million -- a 6-fold
increase. Over the 27-year period the number of adult 
prison inmates rose from 216,000 to 1,319,000. By 
yearend 2001, there were 628 prison inmates per 
100,000 adult residents, up from 149 in 1974.

Between 1974 and 2001 the number of former prisoners 
living in the United States more than doubled, from
1,603,000 to 4,299,000. Relative to the adult population, 
the number of former prisoners totaled 2,045 per 100,000
adult U.S. residents in 2001, up from 1,102 per 100,000
in 1974. At yearend 2001, 1 in every 49 adults in the 
United States was a former prisoner.
 
Two-thirds of the increase in number
ever incarcerated due to rise in first
incarceration rates 

Nearly two-thirds of the 3.8 million increase in the 
number of adults ever incarcerated in prison between 
1974 and 2001 occurred as a result of an increase in 
the rates of first incarceration. In 1974 the number 
of persons admitted to prison for the first time 
totaled 44 per 100,000 adult residents.  By 2001 the 
rate had nearly tripled, reaching 129 first admissions
per 100,000 adults. 

Over 40% of the total increase in first incarceration 
rates occurred between 1986 and 1991. First incarceration 
rates increased from 73 per 100,000 in 1986 to 111 in 
1991.     

About a third of the 3.8 million increase in the number 
ever incarcerated occurred as a result of growth in the 
U.S. resident population. Based on estimates from the 
U.S. Census Bureau, the number of residents 18 and
older increased from 145 million in 1974 to 210 million 
in 2001. Had the rates of first incarceration remained 
stable at 1974 levels, the number of adults who had 
ever gone to prison would have increased by an estimated 
1.3 million.

In every year, the rates of first incarceration varied by 
age. In 2001 sharply higher first incarceration rates were 
found for each older birth cohort up to a peak of 350 per 
100,000 at age 20. These rates then dropped steadily with 
each older age category. 

Between 1974 and 2001 the rate of first incarceration rose 
in nearly every age-specific category. The largest increases 
occurred among younger age cohorts -- those that already 
had high first incarceration rates. The peak incarceration 
rate increased by over 200 persons per 100,000 (from 143 
at age 21 in 1974, to 350 at age 20 in 2001). Rates 
increased even among persons age 45 or older.

In 2001, 3 out of 10 adults ever
incarcerated were age 35 to 44 

Persons between ages 35 and 44 accounted for the largest 
number of current and former prisoners at yearend 2001. 
Born between 1957 and 1966, these persons turned 18 in 
the late 1970s and early 1980s when first incarceration 
rates began to climb.  Between 1974 and 2001, the number
ever incarcerated in this age group rose from 324,000 to 
1.67 million.  

Among persons between ages 25 and 34, the number ever 
incarcerated nearly quadrupled (from 343,000 in 1974 to
1.29 million in 2001). While persons in this age group 
also experienced rising first incarceration rates, they 
were subject to these rates for a smaller portion of 
their lifespan than those ages 35 to 44.  

As a percent of those ever incarcerated, persons ages 35 
to 44 increased from 18% in 1974 to 30% by 2001; persons 
age 25 to 34 increased from 19% in 1974 to 23% in 2001.

Prevalence rates up sharply among
persons under age 50
         
Between 1974 and 2001, the rise in first incarceration 
rates had the largest effects on younger age groups. The
percent of persons ever incarcerated tripled among persons 
ages 25 to 29 (from 1.0% in 1974 to 3.1% in 2001)and more 
than doubled among persons ages 30 to 34 (from 1.3% to 
3.7%) and persons ages 35 to 39 (from 1.4% to 3.8%).

In contrast, the rise in the percents ever incarcerated 
was more modest among persons 50 or older. Although 
these age groups also experienced rising first
incarceration rates, they were exposed at older ages 
when first incarceration rates are low. Persons age 65 
and older were the least affected by the increases in 
first incarceration rates, with percents ever 
incarcerated rising from 1.5% in 1974 to 1.7% in 2001.

These changes in the percents ever incarcerated by age 
reflect rising rates of first incarceration and the age 
of each of these birth cohorts when the increases 
occurred.  In the future, the percents ever incarcerated 
will rise among older age groups as more recent cohorts 
experience the full impact of current levels of first 
incarceration rates throughout their lifetimes.

More males than females and more blacks and 
Hispanics than whites had ever served time in 
prison

Nearly 9 times as many men (5,037,000) as women 
(581,000) had ever been incarcerated in a State or
Federal prison at yearend 2001. As a percentage of all 
persons ever confined in prison, women increased from 
7.8% in 1974 to 10.3% in 2001. 

At yearend 2001 nearly as many blacks (2,166,000) as 
whites (2,203,000) had ever served time in prison; 
Hispanics numbered about half of either group (997,000). 
Together, blacks (39%) and Hispanics (18%) constituted 
a majority of those who had ever served time in prison 
in 2001. Whites accounted for 39% of all those ever 
incarcerated in 2001, down from 51% in 1974.

Over the 27-year period, the share of those who are black 
and Hispanic among persons ever incarcerated increased. 
The number of Hispanics rose nearly 10-fold (up from 
102,000 in 1974) and the number of  blacks more than 
tripled (up from 646,000), while the number of whites 
more than doubled (up from 922,000). As a result, blacks
rose from 36% to 39% of all persons ever incarcerated, 
while Hispanics rose from 6% to 18%.

Nearly 17% of adult black males had ever served 
time in prison

In 2001 an estimated 16.6% of adult black males were 
current or former State or Federal prisoners -- a rate 
that was twice that of Hispanic males (7.7%), and 6 
times that of white males (2.6%).  

Female rates, though significantly lower, reveal similar 
racial and ethnic disparities. Adult black females were
nearly 2 1/2 times more likely than adult Hispanic females 
and 5 1/2 times more likely than adult white females to 
have ever served time in State or Federal prison.

Among adult residents in 2001, an estimated 1.7% of black 
females, 0.7% of Hispanic females and 0.3% of white
females had ever been incarcerated in a prison.

Among both men and women who had ever been confined in 
prison in 2001, blacks outnumbered whites in each age
category under age 45; whites outnumbered blacks in 
nearly every age category 45 or older. The percentage 
of blacks declined steadily among each older age group 
(dropping from 44% among those ages 18 to 24 to 29%
among persons 65 or older). The percentage of Hispanics 
also declined among older age groups (dropping from
24% among those ages 18 to 24 to 8% among those age 65 
or older). In contrast, at yearend 2001 the percentage
white among all adults ever incarcerated increased from 
27% of those ages 18 to 24 to 52% among persons age 65 or
older. 

Regardless of gender, race or
Hispanic origin, prevalence rates
highest among persons age 35 to 44

Although there was wide variation by race, Hispanic origin, 
and gender, within each subgroup, persons ages 35 to 44
had the highest percents ever incarcerated in 2001. Among 
men, the percent ever incarcerated rose for each age group 
to a peak of 6.5% of those ages 35 to 44 and then declined 
to 3.1% of those age 65 or older.  

There was a similar pattern among women, though the percents 
were lower than for men. An estimated 0.9% of women ages 35 
to 44 had ever been in prison, compared to 0.2% for women
ages 18 to 24 and age 65 or older.    

When rates were estimated separately by race and Hispanic 
origin, the variations among age groups remained unchanged.
In every gender and racial/ethnic group in 2001, the percent 
of ever having been incarcerated was lowest among the
youngest group (those ages 18 to 24)and the oldest age group 
(age 65 or older). 

Among persons ages 35 to 44, more than 22.0% of black males 
had ever been incarcerated in prison, over twice as high
as Hispanic males (10.0%), and over 6 times higher than white 
males (3.5%). In this same age group, black women (2.8%) were 
over twice as likely as Hispanic women (1.1%), and nearly 6
times as likely as white women (0.5%) to have been in prison. 

Impact of rising first incarceration rate
varies by birth cohort

Persons born prior to 1940 were nearly unaffected by the 
rising first incarceration rates of the 1980's and 1990's. 
At younger ages (up to the age of 40), the prevalence 
rates at 5-year age intervals were the same for persons 
born in 1935 as in 1910. The rising rates of first
incarceration increased the prevalence of incarceration 
among those born in 1935 as they reached age 45. Similarly,
the prevalence rates rose for those born in 1930 as they 
reached age 50.

Among persons born after 1935, the effects of rising first 
incarceration rates occurred at increasingly younger ages. 
Persons born in 1955 were the first to record higher 
prevalence rates at all ages, compared to persons born in 
prior years. At age 45 the percent ever having been in 
prison reached 3.2% for persons born in 1955 -- more than 
double the percent at that age among persons born in 1930 
or earlier.

The greatest rise occurred in the percents having been 
incarcerated among the most recent cohorts. For persons
born in 1975, 2.6% had been to prison by age 25, nearly 
equal to the percent among persons born in 1950 who had
been to prison by age 50 (2.7%).

Projections for years after 2001 indicate the percent ever 
incarcerated will rise at an accelerated pace. If rates of 
first incarceration remain at 2001 levels, 5.4% of persons 
born in 1965 are expected to have gone to prison by age 75, 
more than three times the 1.7% of persons born in 1930.

The projected rise in the percent ever incarcerated slows 
among persons in later cohorts.  Of those born in 1970,
6.0% are expected to have been in prison by age 75, compared 
to 6.5% of those born in 1975, and 6.6% of those born in
1980.

3.4% of adults projected to have
served time in prison by 2010

The prevalence of having been to prison will rise among the 
U.S. adult population as more birth cohorts experience the 
full impact of current levels of first incarceration. 
Assuming that current age-specific rates of first 
incarceration remain at 2001 levels, the number of adults 
having ever served time in prison is projected to rise to 
7.7 million by 2010.  A total of 3.4% of the adult population 
(1 in 29 persons age 18 or older) is expected to have served 
time in prison.

--------------------------------------------
Lifetime likelihood estimates of going to prison 
differ from current prevalence estimates

The lifetime likelihood of going to prison is an 
estimate of the percentage of all persons in a birth 
cohort expected to go to prison over the course of a 
lifetime. In contrast, the prevalence of ever having
gone to prison is an estimate of the percentage who 
have ever gone to prison among just the surviving 
members of all birth cohorts over a specific period.

Estimates of the lifetime likelihood of going to prison 
project the percentage of persons at birth expected to 
go to prison, if the entire cohort were subject to a 
fixed set of rates of first admission to prison and 
mortality over an entire lifetime. In calculating these 
estimates, incarceration and mortality rates are fixed 
at the time of "birth" of the cohort.

Standard life table techniques were used to prepare 
estimates of the lifetime likelihood of going to prison 
based on rates of first incarceration during a 12-month 
period derived from inmate surveys conducted in 1974, 
1979, 1986, 1991, and 1997. (See Lifetime Likelihood
of Going to State or Federal Prison, NCJ 160092, March 
1997, for a description of previous estimates.)
--------------------------------------------

6.6% of persons born in 2001 will go to
prison, if current rates of first
incarceration remain unchanged

If rates of first incarceration and mortality in 2001 
remain unchanged, nearly 1 in 15 persons born in 
2001 (6.6%) will go to State or Federal prison during 
their lifetime.

Unlike the yearend 2001 prevalence rate of 2.7%, which 
represents the cumulative result of the past incarceration
experiences of the living adult population, the lifetime 
likelihood is a hypothetical projection of the future if 
a birth cohort were to experience a fixed set of rates of
first incarceration and mortality over a lifetime.

Between 1974 and 2001, the lifetime chances of going to 
State or Federal prison for U.S. residents overall in-
creased from 1.9% to 6.6%. Each estimate summarized the 
effects of first incarceration and mortality during a
12-month period in 1974, 1986, 1991, and 2001. The 
estimates do not take into account changes in rates of 
first incarceration or mortality that occur after the 
"birth" of the hypothetical cohort. As a result of steadily 
rising rates of first incarceration from 1974 to 2001, 
the lifetime chances of going to prison for persons 
born in 1974 will be higher than 1.9%. Based on rates 
of first incarceration through 2001, an estimated
2.6% of persons born in 1975 had already been 
incarcerated by age 25.    

6 times higher lifetime chance of going
to prison in 2001 for men than for women

Based on rates of first incarceration in 2001, the 
lifetime chances for men of going to prison are 6 
times greater than those for women. A male has a 
11.3% (or 1 in 9) chance in his life-time of going to
prison, while a female has a 1.8% (or 1 in 56) chance. 
An estimated 9.6% of men and 1.5% of women are expected 
to go to prison by age 40, as first incarceration
rates riserapidly, then decline with advancing age.

In 2001, the chances of going to prison were highest among 
black males (32.2%)and Hispanic males (17.2%) and lowest
among white males (5.9%). The lifetime chances of going 
to prison among black females (5.6%) were nearly as high 
as for white males. Hispanic females (2.2%) and white 
females (0.9%) had much lower chances of going to prison.

As a result of changes in first incarceration and 
mortality rates between 1974 and 2001, black males 
experienced a greater increase in the chances of
going to prison over the course of a lifetime than any 
other group (from 13.4% in 1974 to 32.2% in 2001). 
Hispanic males experienced the second largest increase 
(from 4.0% in 1974 to 17.2% in 2001). White males 
experienced a smaller increase (from 2.2% in 1974 to 5.9% 
in 2001).

The lifetime chances of going to prison increased more 
rapidly for black females (from 1.1% in 1974 to 5.6% in 
2001) than for white males. Hispanic females (from 0.4% 
in 1974 to 2.2% in 2001) and white females (from 0.2% in 
1974 to 0.9% in 2001) had smaller increases in their
lifetime chances of going to prison.

At every age men have higher chances of going to prison 
than women, and blacks and Hispanics have higher chances 
than whites. Based on current rates of first incarceration, 
an estimated 6.7% of black males will enter State or 
Federal prison by the time they are age 20, compared to
3.0% of Hispanic males and 0.8% of white males.  

---------------------------------------------
Methodology

Life table techniques

Life table techniques previously used to illustrate the 
implications of prevailing incarceration rates in 1991 
have been extended to model the incarceration experience 
of actual generations of U.S. residents. (See Lifetime 
Likelihood of Going to State or Federal Prison, NCJ
160092, March 1997.) These generation life tables 
provide the data needed to estimate the number of 
living persons who have ever been incarcerated.

A generation life table traces a birth cohort of 100,000 
persons through their entire lives, subjecting them to 
the observed age-specific mortality and incarceration 
rates which they encountered in each subsequent calendar 
year of life. The procedure is known as a double-decrement 
life table because there are two forms of exit from the 
initial 100,000 birth cohort. The procedure yields 
estimates of the number of persons in the birth cohort
who are incarcerated for the first time each year or 
who die.

At each year of age, the estimated number of living 
persons ever incarcerated is equal to the number of
persons identified as a prisoner for the first time 
that year plus the number of surviving members of the 
birth cohort who were prisoners in prior years. The
age-specific prevalence rate for members of the birth 
cohort is obtained by dividing the surviving number of
persons ever incarcerated by the number of members of 
the 100,000 birth cohort who have survived to the
current age (including both those never incarcerated 
and those ever incarcerated).

To model the incarceration experience of the adult resident 
population in 2001, a separate generation life table was
needed for each birth cohort born from 1901 to 1983. For 
example, of those born in 1980 and alive in 2001, an
estimated 1.510% had ever gone to prison (Appendix table 1, 
column 2). Multiplying by 4,140,721 U.S. residents age 21 
in 2001 (column 1), produced an estimate of 63,000 persons, 
age 21 in 2001, who had ever been incarcerated (column 3).  

Similarly, the generation life table for the 1970 birth 
cohort produced an estimated prevalence of 3.584% among
those age 31 in 2001. Multiplying by 4,032,301 U.S. 
residents age 31 in 2001 resulted in an estimated 145,000
persons age 31 in 2001 who had ever been incarcerated. The 
estimated 5,618,000 adults ever incarcerated in 2001 was 
obtained by summing the number of persons ever incarcerated,
age 18 or older. Dividing by the adult resident population 
of 210,207,901 yielded an estimated prevalence of ever 
having gone to prison of 2.673% in 2001.

Estimating prevalence of imprisonment
in the United States

To illustrate the application of generation life table 
techniques resulting in the 1.510% rate of ever having 
gone to prison among persons born in 1980, consider the 
following calculations:

1. Estimates of the number of persons in a population of 
100,000 born in 1980 who died during each age interval 
were obtained by multiplying the age-specific mortality 
rate (Appendix table 2, column 2) by the number of 
persons alive and not previously incarcerated at each age
(column 1).

*  For example, among persons who reached age 21 without 
having been previously incarcerated, a total of 92 were
estimated to have died (column 3) before reaching age 22 
(that is, 96,607 times the mortality rate of 0.000955).

2. The number of persons in the 1980 cohort who were at 
risk to incarceration during an age interval was then
calculated by subtracting the number dying from the number 
of persons who were alive and not previously incarcerated 
at the beginning of the age interval (column 1 minus 
column 3).

*  An estimated 96,515 of the persons who survived to 
age 21 without being incarcerated were at risk to first
incarceration at age 21.

3. The number of persons in the original 100,000 population 
estimated to have been admitted to prison at each age
(column 5) was then obtained by multiplying the age-specific 
first admission rates (column 4)by the number of persons 
alive and not previously incarcerated.

*  Among persons born in 1980 who had not been previously 
incarcerated by age 21, 343 were estimated to have been
incarcerated before they reached age 22 (that is, 96,515 
times the first incarceration rate of .003557).

4.  The number of living persons at each age who had ever 
gone to prison was then calculated by summing the number
going to prison for the first time during that year of age 
(column 5) plus the number of members of the 1980 birth
cohort who previously went to prison and survived until 
the next year of age (column 6 times the survival rate, 
not shown).

*  Of the 1,132 persons who had gone to prison and reached 
age 20, 1,131 survived to reach age 21. An additional
343 persons were expected to be incarcerated for the 
first time before reaching age 22 (for a cumulative 
total of 1,474).

5. The percent of persons at each specific age who had 
ever gone to prison (column 7) was then calculated by
dividing the number of persons who had ever gone to 
prison and were still alive (column 6) by all persons who 
were still alive (including persons never incarcerated 
plus ever incarcerated).

*  Among persons age 21, the prevalence rate was 1.510%, 
obtained by dividing 1,474 (column 6) by 97,646 (column 
1 minus columns 3 and 5, plus 1,474), times 100%.

Prevalence rates for other birth cohorts were calculated 
using similar procedures.  For example, to estimate the 
percent of persons age 31 in 2001 who had ever gone to 
prison, the calculations were applied to the 1970 birth 
cohort.  However, the rates of first incarceration
(column 4) and mortality (column 2) used in the calculations 
were unique to the birth cohort. (Note the differences
between Appendix tables 2 and 3.)

Limitations  

1. The data in this report are restricted to incarcerations 
in State or Federal prison. Excluded are prior incarcerations 
in local jails and juvenile facilities because of the
lack of data needed to estimate the number of first 
admissions to these forms of correctional supervision.

2. Estimates of the number of first admissions are subject 
to sampling and nonsampling errors. Because the numbers of 
first admissions are based on a sample rather than a 
complete enumeration, the estimated number of first 
admissions may vary depending on the size of the estimate 
and the base population for each demographic group.

Nonsampling error can be attributed to many sources, such 
as nonresponse, differences in interpretation of questions, 
recall difficulties, and processing errors. Among inmates, 
the number of first admissions may be slightly overestimated 
because of underreporting of criminal histories. The full 
extent of nonsampling error is unknown.

3. No comparable inmate survey was conducted prior 1974 to 
enable the calculation of first incarceration rates prior
to this date. First incarceration rates in 1970 and earlier 
were estimated to be 80% of each age-specific rate of first
incarceration in 1974.

If first incarceration rates in 1970 and earlier had 
averaged 90% of each age-specific first incarceration 
rate in 1974, the estimated number of adults alive in 
2001 who had ever gone to prison would have been 1.9% 
higher (5,723,000). Alternatively, if earlier first
incarceration rates had averaged 70% of 1974 rates, 
the estimated number of persons ever to have been 
incarcerated in 2001 would have been-1.9% lower 
(5,513,000).

4. Mortality rate schedules for prisoners were not 
available. Compared with the general population, 
mortality rates for prisoners were estimated to be 20%
higher for adults under age 65, and the same for those 
age 65 and older. The estimate was based on the lower 
overall educational attainment of prisoners, and 
longitudinal studies documenting the relationship 
between mortality and educational attainment.

If mortality rates for adults ever incarcerated, under 
age 65 were instead 40% higher than that of the general 
population, the estimated prevalence of ever having gone 
to prison in 2001 would be 5,567,000 (-0.9% less). If 
mortality rates for prisoners had been equal to that of 
the general population, the estimated prevalence would 
have been 0.9% higher in 2001 (5,670,000).

5. Comparable mortality rates prior to 1976 were not 
available. However, there is minimal effect of
declining mortality rates since 1900 on the estimated 
number of persons ever incarcerated. Prevalence rates 
are only affected to the extent that there may have 
been a different decline in mortality among those ever
incarcerated (the numerator) compared with all surviving 
members of a birth cohort (the denominator). Furthermore,
prevalence rates were applied to estimates of the U.S. 
resident population (which fully reflect declines in 
mortality).     

6. Age-specific incarceration rates do not incorporate 
a forecast of future rates of imprisonment, which may be 
affected by changes in criminal behavior, law enforcement, 
and in sentencing policies.  Consequently, the lifetime 
likelihood of incarceration, 2001, and projected
prevalence rates for 2002 and beyond may be different.
