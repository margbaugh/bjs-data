State Court Processing Statistics 

Every 2 years, as part of its State Court Processing Statistics
(SCPS) program, the Bureau of Justice Statistics tracks a sample
of felony cases filed during the month of May in 40 of the
Nation's 75 largest counties.  The most recent SCPS study
analyzed cases filed during May 1996.

Trends in processing of felony defendants, 1990-96

Since 1990, the proportion of defendants charged with a violent
offense has remained at about one-fourth.  From 1992 to 1996,
the proportion of drug defendants increased from 3 in 10 to
about 3 in 8.  In each year, approximately 1 in 3 defendants
have been charged with a property crime and 1 in 12 with a
public-order offense.

In 1996, the percentage of defendants age 40 or older was 18%,
an increase from the 1994 level of 14%, and nearly twice the 10%
found in the 1990 study.  At the same time, the percentage of
defendants under age 25 in 1996 was lower than in previous years.

Defendant demographics have been relatively consistent in terms
of race and gender since 1990.  The percentage of female
defendants has been near 15% in all years.  Non-Hispanic blacks
have accounted for about half of defendants each year while
non-Hispanic whites and Hispanics have comprised about a fourth
each.

Since 1990, roughly 3 in 8 defendants have had an active
criminal justice status at the time of arrest in each of the
SCPS studies.  The percentage of defendants with a felony arrest
record was higher in 1996 (60%) than in previous years when it
averaged about 55%.  The proportion of defendants with a felony
conviction record has also increased somewhat -- from 36% in
1990 to 40% in 1996.

Since 1990, the proportion of felony defendants released prior
to case disposition has been fairly consistent, ranging from 62%
to 65%.  Likewise, the proportion of released defendants charged
with misconduct such as failure to appear in court or rearrest
has remained at just under one-third.

Failure-to-appear rates have held steady at just under
one-fourth.

After reaching a high of 61% in the 1994 study, the felony
conviction rate for 1996 decreased to 55%.  This rate was
similar to that found in 1992, but higher than the 50% felony
conviction rate in the 1990 study.  The percentage of defendants
convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor was 70% in 1996, similar
to the conviction rates for 1994 (72%) and 1990 (68%), but
higher than the 64% of defendants convicted in the 1990 SCPS
study. 

For defendants convicted of a felony, sentences were less likely
to involve incarceration in 1994 (68%) and 1996 (69%) than in
1990 (75%) or 1992 (74%).  This was primarily because of a drop
in the percentage of defendants sentenced to prison, and an
increase in the use of probation as the most severe sentence. In
all years, about a third of felony convictions resulted in a
jail sentence.

Felony defendants in large urban counties, 1996

Arrest charges

An estimated 54,579 felony cases were filed in the State courts
of the Nation's 75 largest counties during May 1996.  A fourth
of the defendants in these cases were charged with a violent
offense, usually assault (11.4%) or robbery (7.1%).  A small
percentage of defendants were charged with murder (0.9%) or rape
(1.5%).  

About 2 in 3 defendants were charged with either a drug (37%) or
property (31%) offense.  Half of drug defendants, 18.5% of
defendants overall, were charged with drug trafficking.  A
majority of property defendants were charged with theft (12.3%
of all defendants) or burglary (8.1%).  Eight percent of all
defendants were charged with a public-order offense.  Often
these charges were weapons-related (2.8% of all defendants) or
driving-related (2.7%).

Demographic characteristics

Eighty-four percent of defendants were male, with the largest
percentages among those charged with rape (100%), murder (96%),
a weapons offense (95%), or a driving-related offense (95%).
Women accounted for about a fourth of the defendants charged
with a property offense other than burglary.  

Blacks comprised about two-thirds of the defendants charged with
robbery or a weapons offense.  Whites accounted for about
two-thirds of those charged with a driving-related felony.

About half of defendants were under age 30.  Nineteen percent
were under age 21, including 32% of those charged with murder,
and 38% of those charged with robbery.  Four percent of
defendants were under age 18, including 15% of robbery
defendants and 10% of murder defendants.

Criminal history

At the time of arrest, more than a third of defendants had an
active criminal justice status such as probation (16%), release
pending disposition of a prior case (13%), or parole (6%).
Robbery defendants (43%) were the most likely to have a criminal
justice status.  

Nearly three-fourths of all defendants had been arrested
previously (72%), with 43% having at least five prior arrest
charges.  Sixty percent of defendants had a felony arrest record.

An estimated 40% of defendants had at least one prior conviction
for a felony.  Eighteen percent had a prior conviction for a
violent felony, including about a fourth of murder, weapons, and
robbery defendants.

Pretrial release and detention

Thirty-seven percent of all defendants were detained until the
court disposed of their case, including 6% who were denied bail.
A majority of defendants  charged with murder (84%), robbery
(61%), or burglary (53%) were detained.  Sixty-one percent of
murder defendants were denied bail.  

Fifty-three percent of the defendants with an active criminal
justice status were detained until case disposition, compared to
27% of those without such a status.  Defendants on parole (73%)
were the most likely to be detained, followed by those on
probation (58%).

Released defendants were most likely to be released on personal
recognizance (38% of all releases).  The next most common type
of pretrial release was surety bond (28%), followed by deposit
bond (11%) and conditional release (9%).  

Nearly a third (31%) of released defendants committed one or
more types of pretrial misconduct while in a release status.
Twenty-two percent failed to appear in court as scheduled, and
16% were rearrested for a new offense.

Adjudication

About a fourth of all defendants had their case adjudicated
within 1 month of arrest, and about half within 3 months.  At
the end of the 1-year study period, 86% of all cases had been
adjudicated.

Seventy percent of the cases adjudicated within 1 year resulted
in a conviction.  Conviction rates were highest for defendants
charged with a driving-related offense (80%) or drug trafficking
(78%) and lowest for defendants charged with assault (53%).

Fifty-five percent of all defendants were convicted of a felony,
and 15% of a misdemeanor.  Felony conviction rates were highest
for defendants originally charged with drug trafficking (68%),
murder (62%), burglary (62%), a driving-related offense (61%),
or a weapons offense (59%).  Assault defendants (33%) had the
lowest felony conviction rate.

Ninety-four percent of convictions occurring during the 1-year
study period were obtained through a guilty plea.  Nearly 4 in 5
guilty pleas were to a felony.  About half of murder convictions
resulted from guilty pleas and about half from trial verdicts.
Overall, 77% of trials resulted in a guilty verdict, including
86% of murder trials.

Sentencing

A majority (66%) of convicted defendants were sentenced within 1
day of adjudication.  About two-thirds of all sentences were
either to prison (30%) or jail (37%).  Two-thirds of all jail
sentences included a probation term.  Nearly all convicted
defendants who did not receive an incarceration sentence were
placed on probation.  

Thirty-five percent of the defendants convicted of a felony were
sentenced to prison, including all of those convicted of murder.
A majority of  robbery (71%) and rape (56%) convictions resulted
in prison sentences.

More than half of those with multiple prior felony convictions
(58%) were sentenced to prison following a felony conviction in
the current case, compared to about a fifth of those with no
prior felony convictions (21%).   

Excluding life sentences, the mean prison sentence imposed on
defendants convicted of a violent felony was 8 years, and the
median was 5 years. For those convicted of a nonviolent offense,
the mean was 4 years and the median was 3 years.  Murder (30
years) and rape (8 years) convictions carried the longest median
prison sentences.  About a fourth of convicted murderers
received a life sentence. 

State Court Processing Statistics

Since 1988, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has sponsored
a biennial data collection on the processing of felony
defendants in the State courts of the Nation's 75 most populous
counties.  Previously known as the National Pretrial Reporting
Program, this data collection series was renamed the State Court
Processing Statistics (SCPS) program to better reflect the wide
range of data elements collected.  

The SCPS program collects data on the demographic
characteristics, criminal history, pretrial processing,
adjudication, and sentencing of felony defendants.  The SCPS
data do not include Federal defendants.  The reader should refer
to the annual BJS Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics for
information on the processing of Federal defendants.  

The 1996 SCPS collected data for 15,474 felony cases filed
during May 1996 in 40 large counties.  These cases, which were
tracked for up to 1 year, were part of a 2-stage sample that was
representative of the estimated 54,579 felony cases filed in the
Nation's 75 most populous counties during that month.

In 1996, the 75 largest counties accounted for 37% of the U.S.
population.  According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports
program for 1996, these jurisdictions accounted for 50% of all
reported serious violent crimes in the United States, including
63% of all robberies.  They accounted for 40% of all reported
serious property crimes.  

According to the BJS National Judicial Reporting Program, 43% of
all felony convictions in 1996 occurred in the 75 largest
counties.  For national estimates pertaining to felony
convictions, see the BJS report Felony Sentences in State
Courts, 1996.

Arrest charges

About a fourth of the defendants charged with a felony in the 75
largest counties during May 1996 had been arrested for a violent
offense (24.7%) (table 1).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Nearly half of those charged with a violent felony, 11.4% of 
defendants overall, faced charges for assault, and almost a third, 
7.1% of defendants overall, were charged with robbery.  Murder 
defendants comprised about 3% of the defendants charged with a 
violent felony, and about 1% of all felony defendants.  Rape 
defendants represented nearly 6% of the defendants charged with 
a violent felony, 1.5% of all felony defendants  (See Methodology 
for the specific crimes included in each offense category.)

For more than a third of all defendants, the most serious arrest
charge was a drug offense (36.8%).  About half of drug
defendants were charged with drug trafficking.  Overall,
defendants were more likely to be charged with drug trafficking
(18.5%) or other drug offenses (18.2%) than any other type of
offense (figure 1.  The most frequently charged offenses of
felony defendants in the 75 largest counties, 1996).

Nearly a third of all felony defendants were charged with a
property offense (30.8%).  About 2 in 5 property defendants,
12.3% of defendants overall, were charged with theft, and just
over a fourth, 8.1% overall, were charged with burglary.  

Defendants charged with a public-order offense comprised 7.7% of
all defendants.  About two-thirds of public-order defendants
faced a weapons or driving-related charge.  

The percentage of felony defendants in the 75 largest counties
that faced a drug-related charge increased from 1994 to 1996 as
it did from 1992 to 1994.  The proportion charged with a violent
or public-order felony was about the same in 1996 as in 1990,
1992, or 1994.  The percentage of defendants charged with a
property offense in 1996 was similar to that for 1994, but less
than in 1992 (Figure 2. Most serious arrest charge of felony
defendants in the 75 largest counties, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994,
and 1996).  

Slightly more than half of all felony defendants (54%) faced at
least one additional charge and 39% were charged with at least
one additional felony (table 2).

----------------------------------------------------------------  

Nearly two-thirds of defendants whose most serious arrest charge 
was drug trafficking (65%), rape (64%), or robbery (63%) were 
charged with one or more additional offenses. 

Defendants whose most serious arrest charge was drug trafficking
(57%) or rape (56%) were the most likely to face at least 1
additional felony charge.  Just over half of murder (53%) or
robbery (52%) defendants also faced 1 or more additional felony
charges.  About a fourth of the defendants charged with a
public-order offense (26%), or with a drug offense other than
trafficking (23%) faced multiple felony charges.   


Demographic characteristics


Overall, 84% of felony defendants in the 75 largest counties
were male (table 3).

Note:  Data on gender of defendants were available for 99.9% of all cases and data on race of 
defendants  were available for 90% of all cases.  Without consideration of Hispanic origin, Bureau of 
the Census data for 1996 indicate that the racial distribution of the population of the 75 largest counties 
was 75% white, 17% black, and 7% other races.  Detail may not add to total because of rounding.

---------------------------------------------------------------- 

Men comprised the largest percentages among defendants charged with 
rape (100%), murder (96%), weapons (95%), driving-related offenses 
(95%), robbery (93%), or burglary (91%).  Women accounted for 16% 
of defendants, including about a fourth of the defendants charged 
with property offenses other than burglary.

Without consideration of Hispanic origin, which was reported
poorly in some jurisdictions (see Methodology), 58% of
defendants were black, 40% were white, and 2% other races. 
Blacks comprised the largest percentages among defendants
charged with robbery (69%), weapons offenses (64%), murder
(63%), drug trafficking (63%), and assault (61%).  Whites
accounted for two-thirds of the defendants facing
driving-related charges (Figure 3. Race of felony defendants in
the 75 largest counties, by most serious arrest charge, 1996).

About a fourth of defendants were Hispanic (24%), including
nearly a third of those charged with a driving-related offense
(32%) or drug trafficking (30%) (table 4).

non-Hispanic, and 17% Hispanics of any race.  Detail may not add to total because of rounding.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Non-Hispanic whites also comprised about a fourth of defendants 
(23%), including two-fifths of those charged with a driving-related 
offense. Non-Hispanic blacks accounted for half of all defendants,
including a majority of those charged with robbery (60%), drug
trafficking (54%), or weapons offenses (54%). 

The average age of defendants at the time of arrest was 31 years
(table 5).

----------------------------------------------------------------

By specific offense, the average age ranged from 27
years for robbery defendants to 34 for those charged with a
driving-related offense.  

Within each of the four major offense categories (violent,
property, drug, and public-order), about half of the defendants
were under age 30.  Eighteen percent of defendants were age 40
or older, including 27% of those charged with a driving-related
offense.  Four percent of defendants were under age 18,
including 15% of robbery and 10% of murder defendants.

About half of robbery (53%) and murder (52%) defendants were
under age 25, compared to a third of defendants overall (figure
4 Felony defendants under age 25 and age 21 in the 75 largest
counties, by most serious arrest charge, 1996).  Defendants
charged with assault (32%) or driving-related offenses (14%)
were the least likely to be under age 25.

Robbery defendants (38%) were twice as likely as defendants
overall (19%) to be under age 21.  Murder defendants (32%) were
also much more likely to be under age 21 than other defendants.
Defendants charged with a driving-related offense (5%) were the
least likely to be this young.

Males formed a higher percentage of defendants under age 18
(93%) than of other age groups (table 6).

----------------------------------------------------------------

More than two-thirds of the defendants under age 18 were black, 
compared to three-fifths or less in other age groups.  Black males 
comprised the largest proportion of defendants in each age group 
(figure 5 Race and gender of felony defendants in the 75 largest 
counties, by age at arrest, 1996).  This effect was most pronounced 
in the under 18 age category where black males (67%) accounted for 
more than twice the percentage accounted for by white males (26%). 
It was least pronounced in the over 40 age category, where black
males (45%) accounted for a proportion of defendants much closer
to that accounted for by white males (37%). 

Black females comprised a slightly higher percentage than white
females in most of the age categories, but for no more than 13%
of the defendants in any single age category.


Criminal justice status at time of arrest

Thirty-six percent of felony defendants had an active criminal
justice status at the time of their arrest on the current felony
charge (table 7).

Note:  Data on criminal justice status at time of arrest were available for 88% of all cases.
Nine percent of defendants with a criminal justice status had more than 1 type of status.
For those cases, the status indicated is the most serious.
Detail may not add to total because of rounding.
--Less than 0.5%
-----------------------------------------------------------
 
Among defendants charged with a violent offense, a third had a 
criminal justice status, ranging from more than two-fifths of 
robbery defendants (43%) to about a fourth of assault defendants 
(26%).  

Thirty-five percent of property defendants had a criminal
justice status, including 41% of burglary defendants.  Among
drug defendants, 38% had a criminal justice status overall. 
Those charged with drug trafficking (40%) were slightly more
likely to have a criminal justice status than those charged with
other drug offenses (36%). 

Thirty-nine percent of public-order defendants had an active
criminal justice status at the time of the current arrest.  This
included 36% of those charged with a weapons offense, 40% of
those charged with a driving-related offense, and 41% of those
charged with other public-order offenses.

About 1 in 11 defendants with a criminal justice status had more
than one type of status.  When just the most serious criminal
justice status is considered, 16% of defendants were on
probation, 13% had been released pending disposition of a
previous case, and 6% were on parole at the time of the current
arrest.  Allowing for defendants with multiple criminal justice
statuses, 16% were on probation, 14% had been released on a
prior case, and 6% were on parole.

Defendants charged with robbery (8%) or a weapons offense (8%)
were more than twice as likely as those charged with a
driving-related offense (3%) or assault (3%) to have been on
parole at the time of their arrest on the current charges.
Five percent of murder and rape defendants were
parolees at the time of arrest.

Defendants charged with a driving-related offense (19%) or
burglary (19%) were more likely than other defendants to have
been on probation at the time of arrest.  Those charged with
murder (8%) were the least likely to have been on probation.

Defendants charged with drug trafficking (19%), robbery (18%),
or murder (17%) were the most likely to have been on release
pending disposition of a prior case when they were arrested on
the current felony charge.  These defendants were nearly twice
as likely as those charged with assault (10%) or rape (10%) to
have had such a status at the time of the current arrest.

Prior arrests

Nearly three-fourths of all defendants had at least one prior
felony or misdemeanor arrest (table 8).

-----------------------------------------------------------
 
By general offense category, the percentage of defendants with a 
prior arrest ranged from 67% of those currently charged with a 
violent offense to 77% of those charged with a drug offense.  

Among defendants charged with a violent offense, those charged
with robbery (72%) or murder (71%) were the most likely to have
a prior arrest record, and those charged with rape (55%) the
least likely.  

Among property defendants, 79% of those charged with burglary
had been arrested previously, compared to 72%  of theft
defendants, and 61% of those charged with other property
offenses. 

Among public-order defendants, about four-fifths of those
charged with a driving-related felony (79%) had an arrest
record.  About three-fourths of  weapons defendants (73%) 
had been arrested previously as had about two-thirds of 
those charged with other public-order offenses (68%).

Among defendants with an arrest record, nearly all had been 
arrested more than once, and a majority had at least 5 prior 
arrest charges.  Overall, 63% of defendants had two or more
prior arrest charges, and 43% had five or more.  Defendants
charged with burglary (52%) were the most likely to have five 
or more prior arrest charges.  

Twenty-six percent of all defendants had 10 or more prior arrest
charges.  This included 34% of burglary defendants, 29% of
robbery and theft defendants, and 28% of defendants charged with
drug trafficking.

About two-thirds of the defendants under the age of 18 had no
previous arrests.  This proportion dropped to 2 in 5
among defendants age 18 to 20, about a fourth among those in the
21-to-24 age group, and about a fifth among those age 25 to 49. 
About a third of those age 50 or older had no arrest record.  

About a fifth of the defendants age 18 to 20 had 5 or more prior
arrests.  This proportion rose to more than a third of
defendants in the 21-to-24 age range, and about half in the
25-to-49 age range.  In the latter age range, defendants were
more than twice as likely to have five or more prior arrests as
no prior arrests.

Among defendants with an arrest record, about 5 in 6 had been 
arrested at least once for a felony (table 9).

Overall, three-fifths of defendants had a felony arrest record 
(60%).  Nearly half had multiple prior felony arrest charges 
(47%), including 25% with five or more.

Just over half of the defendants facing a current charge for a
violent felony had been previously arrested for a felony,
including 62% of robbery defendants and 58% of murder
defendants.  Twenty-nine percent of robbery defendants had 5 or
more prior felony arrest charges, including 12% with 10 or more.

Nearly three-fifths of property defendants (58%) had one or more
prior felony arrests.  Those charged with burglary (68%) were
the most likely to have a felony arrest record.  About a third
of burglary defendants had at least 5 prior felony arrest
charges, and a sixth had 10 or more.   

About two-thirds of drug defendants (65%) had at least 1 prior
felony arrest.  About a fourth had five or more prior felony
arrest charges, including 29% of those whose most serious
current charge was drug trafficking.

About three-fifths of public-order defendants also had been
previously arrested for a felony, and a fifth had five or more
prior felony charges.  A fourth of weapons defendants had at
least five prior felony charges.  

Prior convictions

Fifty-nine percent of felony defendants in the 75 largest

About a sixth of the defendants currently charged with a
violent offense had a prior conviction for a violent felony.  

By specific arrest charge, the percentage of defendants
previously convicted of a violent felony ranged from 29% of
murder defendants to 15% of defendants charged with a
driving-related offense. 

The most serious prior conviction was a nonviolent felony for
about 1 in 3 defendants charged with burglary (32%).  This was
also the case for more than a fourth of defendants charged with
drug trafficking (29%), theft (28%), or a driving-related
offense (28%).

Defendants charged with a driving-related offense (28%) were
about twice as likely as other defendants to have a conviction
record that consisted only of misdemeanors.

Rates of release and detention

An estimated 63% of felony defendants in the 75 largest counties
were released prior to the final disposition of their case
(table 13).

By general offense category, defendants charged
with a violent offense (55%) were less likely to be released
than those whose most serious arrest charge was a public-order
(71%), drug (66%), or property (65%) offense.  

Within the violent offense category, release rates varied
greatly.  Just 16% of murder defendants were released compared
to 66% of those charged with assault.  Fifty-one percent of rape
defendants and 39% of robbery defendants were released before
the court disposed of their case.

Among defendants charged with a property offense, about half of
those charged with burglary (47%) were released, compared to
two-thirds of theft (66%) defendants and about three-fourths
(77%) of those charged with other property offenses.  

Among drug defendants, those charged with drug trafficking (62%)
were less likely to be released than those charged with other
drug offenses (71%).  Among public-order defendants, those
charged with a driving-related offense (78%) were the most
likely to be released.

Among the 37% of defendants who were detained in jail until case
disposition, about 5 in 6 had a bail amount set but did not post
the money required to secure release.  Detained murder
defendants were the exception to this rule, as about
three-fourths of them, 61% of all murder defendants overall,
were ordered held without bail.  Overall, 6% of felony
defendants in the 75 largest counties were denied bail.

A majority of the defendants released prior to case disposition,
34% of defendants overall, were released under nonfinancial
conditions that did not require the posting of bail (see
Methodology for definitions related to pretrial release) (table
14).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Release on personal recognizance, granted to 24% of all
defendants and 38% of released defendants, was the type of
release used most often.  

Other nonfinancial types of release included conditional release
(6% of all defendants and 9% of released defendants), and
release on unsecured bond (4% and 7%). 

Twenty-nine percent of defendants secured release through
financial terms that involved the posting of a financial bond in
the form of money or property.  The most common type of
financial release was surety bond (18% of all defendants and 29%
of released defendants), which involves the services of a
commercial bail bond agent.  Other types of financial release
included deposit bond (7% of all defendants and 11% of released
defendants), full cash bond (2% and 3%), and property bond (2%
and 3%).  These bonds are posted directly with the court without
the use of a bail bond agent.

About 1% of defendants were released prior to case disposition
as the result of an emergency release used to relieve jail
crowding.  Such releases did not involve the use of any of the
types of release mentioned above.

Bail amounts

About 3 in 5 felony defendants had a bail amount set by the
court, and were required to post all or part of that amount to
secure release while their case was pending.  The remainder were
granted nonfinancial release (34%), ordered held without bail
(6%), or were part of an emergency release (1%).  About half of
those with a bail amount had it set at $10,000 or more,
including 25% who had it set at $25,000 or more (table 15).

Among defendants with a bail amount set, those charged with a
violent offense (40%) were about twice as likely as other
defendants to have it set at $25,000 or more.  Three-fourths of
murder defendants with a bail amount had it set at $25,000 or
more, as did  just over half of robbery defendants (57%) and
nearly half of rape defendants (47%).  

Among property defendants with a bail amount set, those charged
with burglary (27%) were about twice as likely to have bail set
at $25,000 or more as other property defendants.  Among drug
defendants, those charged with drug trafficking (27%) were about
twice as likely to have bail set at $25,000 or more as other
drug defendants (13%).

Overall, defendants who were detained until case disposition had
a median bail amount 3 times that of defendants who secured
release ($15,000 versus $5,000) (table 16).

Note:  Data on bail amount were available for 98% of all defendants for whom  a bail amount was set.  
Bail amounts have been rounded. Table excludes defendants given nonfinancial release.

----------------------------------------------------------------

The mean bail amount for detained defendants ($50,000) was more 
than 5 times that of defendants who secured release ($9,300).  

Detained murder defendants had the highest median ($100,000) and
mean ($198,400) bail amounts.  Overall, the median bail amount
for murder defendants was $50,000 and the mean was $133,100. 
Robbery defendants  had an overall median bail amount of $25,000
and an overall mean bail amount of $75,900.

Overall, just under half (47%) of defendants who were required
to post bail to secure release did so.  About 7 in 10 defendants
with a bail set at under $5,000 posted the amount needed for
release, as did about 6 in 10 defendants with a bail amount of
$5,000 to $9,999.  In contrast, about 1 in 8 of those
with bail set at $50,000 or more, and a fourth of those
with a bail amount of at least $25,000 but less than $50,000
were able to meet the financial conditions required for release.

Among defendants given financial release, the average bail
amount was highest for those released on property bond (a median
of $7,500 and a mean of $12,400), and lowest for those released
on full cash bond (a median of $1,000 and a mean of $2,900).   

Defendants released on surety and deposit bond both had a median
bail amount of $5,000.  The mean for both was just under
$10,000.  

Unlike those released on full cash bond, defendants released on
deposit bond generally posted 10% of the full bail amount with
the court to secure release.  However, they remained liable to
the court for the full bail amount if they violated the terms of
release.

Those released on surety bond paid a similar fee to a bail bond
agent, who assumed liability to the court for the full bail
amount if the defendant violated the terms of release.

Type of                 Bail amount      
release bond         Median       Mean

Surety               $5,000     $9,500
Deposit               5,000      9,800
Full cash             1,000      2,900

Unsecured            $5,000    $10,000

Defendants released on an unsecured bond had a median bail
amount of $5,000 and a mean bail amount of $10,000.  These
defendants did not have to post any of this amount, but like
those on financial release, they  were liable for the full bail
amount if they violated the terms of release.

Time from arrest to release

Among defendants who were released prior to case disposition,
about half were released within 1 day (49%), and about
four-fifths were released within 1 week (79%) (table 17).

Note:  Data on time from arrest to release were available for 97% of all cases.   
Release data were collected for 1 year.    

----------------------------------------------------------------

Nearly all releases during the 1-year study occurred within a
month of arrest (92%).  

By general offense category, defendants charged with a violent
(41%) or drug (45%) offense were less likely to be released
within 1 day of arrest than those charged with a public-order
(57%) or property (56%) offense. 

More than half of the defendants released after being charged
with a property offense other than burglary, or a public-order
offense that was not weapons-related were released within 1 day
of their arrest.

Defendants charged with murder typically waited the longest to
be released.  For example, after 1 month, 66% of all murder
defendant releases had occurred, compared to more than 90% of
the releases of other defendants.  

When differences among types of offense are held constant,
defendants released under financial terms generally took longer
to secure their release than those who were released under
nonfinancial conditions.  Among defendants who were released
under financial conditions, the amount of time from arrest to
pretrial release tended to increase as the bail amount did.

Criminal history and probability of release

Court decisions about bail and pretrial release are primarily
based on the judgment of whether a defendant will appear in
court as scheduled and whether there is potential danger to the
community from crimes that a defendant may commit if released.  

Many States have established specific criteria to be considered
by the courts when setting release conditions.  The SCPS data 
illustrate how release rates vary with some of these factors.  
For example, 73% of the defendants without an active criminal 
justice status at the time of their arrest for the current 
offense were released prior to case disposition,
compared to 47% of those with such a status (table 18).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Defendants on parole (27%) at the time of arrest were the least
likely to be released.  This compared with 42% of those on
probation and 66% of those released pending disposition of a
prior case.

Eighty-one percent of the defendants with no prior arrests were
released, compared to 57% of those who had been previously
arrested.  Among defendants with an arrest record, those who had
never missed a court appearance (62%) had a higher probability
of being released than those who had failed to appear at least
once during a previous case (53%). 

Eighty percent of defendants without a prior conviction were
released prior to disposition of the current case, compared to
53% of those with a conviction record.  Among defendants with a
conviction record, release rates ranged from 66% for those with
a single prior conviction to 43% for those with five or more.

Less than half of the defendants with one or more prior felony
convictions (47%) were released prior to disposition of the
current case, compared to nearly two-thirds of those whose prior
convictions involved only misdemeanors (65%).  Those with a
prior conviction for a violent felony (47%) had the same release
rate as those whose most serious prior conviction was for a
nonviolent felony (47%).

Conduct of released defendants

Among defendants who were released prior to case disposition,
nearly a third  committed some type of misconduct while in a
release status (table 19).

This may have been in the form of a failure to appear in court, 
an arrest for a new offense, or some other violation of release 
conditions that resulted in the revocation of that release 
by the court. 

By original offense category, the proportion of defendants
charged with pretrial misconduct ranged from about two-fifths
among drug defendants (39%), to about a fourth of defendants
charged with a public-order (24%) or violent offense (23%). 
Twenty-nine percent of property defendants committed some type
of pretrial misconduct. 

The widest range of misconduct rates was found within the
violent offense category, ranging from 34% of robbery defendants
to 12% of rape defendants.

Failure to appear in court

Nearly four-fifths of the defendants who were released prior to
case disposition made all scheduled court appearances (78%). 
Bench warrants for failing to appear in court were issued for
the remaining 22% (table 20).

Note:  Data on the court appearance record for the current case were available for 98% of cases 
involving a defendant released prior to case disposition.  All defendants who failed to appear
in court and were not returned to the court during the 1-year study period are counted 
as fugitives.  Some of these defendants may have been returned to the court at a later date.
Detail may not add to total because of rounding.

----------------------------------------------------------------
  
A higher percentage of released drug  defendants (29%) and
property defendants (22%) failed to appear in court than
defendants charged with violent (14%) or public-order (14%)
offenses.

Within the violent offense category, failure-to-appear rates
were higher for defendants charged with robbery (20%) than for
other defendants.  

About a fourth of the defendants who failed to appear in court,
6% of all defendants, were still fugitives at the end of the
1-year study period.  The remainder were returned to the court
(either voluntarily or not) before the end of the study.

Defendants released after being charged with a drug (8%) or
property (6%) offense were about twice as likely to be a
fugitive after 1 year as defendants released after being charged
with other offenses.  No released murder defendants were in a
fugitive status at the end of the 1-year study period.

Rearrest for a new offense

Overall, 16% of released defendants were rearrested for a new
offense allegedly committed while they awaited disposition of
their original case (table 21).

Note:  Rearrest data were available for 97% of released defendants.   Rearrest data  were
for 1 year.  Rearrests occurring after the end of this 1-year study period  are not included in the table.
Information on rearrests occurring in jurisdictions other than the one granting the pretrial release
was not always available.  Detail may not add to total because of rounding.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Sixty-two percent of these defendants, 10% of all released 
defendants, were charged with a new felony.  Sixty-three percent 
of the new felony arrests were for the same type of offense 
as the original charge.  

By original arrest offense category, released drug defendants
(20%) had the highest rearrest rate.  This included 23% of
defendants released after being charged with drug trafficking.  
Robbery defendants (22%) also had a higher rearrest rate than 
the overall average.  Defendants  released after being charged 
with murder (6%) or rape (8%) were the least likely to be 
rearrested.

Time from arrest to adjudication

For about half of felony defendants in the 75 largest counties,
adjudication of their case occurred within 3 months of arrest,
and about 6 in 7 cases were adjudicated within 1 year of arrest
(table 22).

Note:  Data on time from arrest to adjudication were available for 98% of all cases.
The median time from arrest to adjudication includes cases still pending at the end of the study.
Knowing the exact times for these cases would not change the medians reported.
--The median time from arrest to adjudication for murder defendants extended beyond the
1-Year study period and could not be calculated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The median time from arrest to adjudication for murder
defendants was greater than 1 year, a considerably longer time
than for other defendants.  An estimated 58% of murder
defendants were awaiting adjudication of their case after 1
year, compared to a maximum of 19% in any other offense category.

After murder defendants, the longest median time from arrest to
adjudication was for rape defendants (142 days).  This was about
twice the median time for defendants charged with burglary (70
days) or a public-order offense that was not weapons-related or
driving-related (69 days).  

For each offense other than murder (for which medians could not
be calculated), the median time from arrest to adjudication was
shorter for detained defendants than for those released pending
case disposition.  

The median time from arrest to adjudication was about 2 months
longer for defendants released after being charged with rape, robbery,
or assault than for those detained. Among those charged with a
weapons offense, theft, drug trafficking, or a driving-related
offense the median was about 3 months longer for those released
than for those detained. 

Excluding murder defendants, the longest median time from arrest
to adjudication among released defendants was for those charged
with rape (188 days), robbery (155 days), or drug trafficking
(140 days).  Detained driving-related defendants (33 days) had
the shortest adjudication time.

Adjudication outcome

Seventy percent of the defendants who had their cases
adjudicated within 1 year of arrest were convicted (table 23).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

A large majority of these convictions were for a felony, with
55% of all defendants eventually convicted of a felony.

Three-fifths of defendants whose most serious arrest charge was
a violent offense (60%) were eventually convicted of a felony or
a misdemeanor, compared to about three-fourths of those
originally charged with a property (72%), drug (74%), or
public-order (74%) offense.  Defendants whose most serious
arrest charge was a driving-related felony (80%) had the highest
overall conviction rate, and defendants charged with felony
assault (53%) had the lowest.

The probability of being convicted of a felony was highest for
defendants whose most serious arrest charge was drug trafficking
(68%).  The next highest felony conviction rates were found
among defendants whose original arrest charge was murder (62%),
burglary (62%), or a driving-related offense (61%).  The lowest
felony conviction rate was for assault defendants (33%).

In most cases where the defendant was not convicted, it was
because the charges against the defendant were dismissed by the
prosecutor or the court.  Dismissal occurred in 29% of all
cases.  Defendants charged with assault (45%) were more than
twice as likely as those charged with a driving-related offense
(18%) or drug trafficking (20%) to have their case dismissed.  

Less than 1% of all cases had other outcomes such as diversion
or deferred adjudication.  No murder defendants had their cases
handled in this manner, nor did more than 1% of the defend-
ants in any other offense category.

Nearly four-fifths of the defendants who were detained until
case disposition (78%) were eventually convicted of some
offense, compared to about two-thirds of those who were released
pending disposition (66%) (table 24).

An estimated 69% of detained defendants were convicted of a
felony, compared to 49% of released defendants.

Adjudication outcome was related to some extent to the number
and type 

of the original arrest charges filed.  Three-fourths of
defendants who were originally charged with more than 1 felony
were eventually convicted of some offense compared to about
two-thirds of the defendants who had no additional felony
charges (table 25).

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Sixty-four percent of defendants whose original arrest charges
included more than one felony were eventually convicted of a
felony compared to 50% of those with no additional felony
charges.  Among the defendants who had no additional felony
charges but were charged with one or more misdemeanors, 37% were
convicted of a felony.  Defendants in this latter group were
about twice as likely as other defendants to eventually be
convicted of a misdemeanor, usually by pleading guilty to such a
charge instead of the original felony charge.

Overall, about two-thirds of defendants entered a guilty plea at
some point, with 52% pleading guilty to a felony, and 14% to a
misdemeanor.   

About two-thirds of defendants charged with a nonviolent offense
entered a guilty plea, and about half pleaded guilty to a
felony.  Defendants charged with a driving-related offense (77%)
were the most likely to enter a guilty plea.  A  majority of the
defendants in each nonviolent offense category pleaded guilty to
a felony, including 64% of those charged with drug trafficking.

Among defendants charged with a violent offense, robbery
defendants (64%) had the highest overall plea rate, and murder
defendants (35%) had the lowest.  About half of robbery (51%)
and rape (50%) defendants pleaded guilty to a felony, compared
to about a third of murder (33%) and assault (29%) defendants.  

An estimated 6% of the cases adjudicated within 1 year went to
trial.  These cases were evenly split between bench trials and
jury trials.  An estimated 77% of all trials ended with a guilty
verdict, and 23% with an acquittal.  Jury trials (84%) were more
likely to result in a conviction than bench trials (72%). About
3 in 4 jury trials resulted in a felony conviction compared to 3
in 5 bench trials.

A third of defendants facing murder charges went to trial,
compared to less than a tenth of defendants charged with other
offenses.    

Regardless of the method of adjudication, defendants who were
convicted were usually convicted of the same felony offense as
the original arrest charge.  This was most likely to be the case
when the original arrest charge was for a nonviolent offense.

Among defendants arrested for murder and later convicted, 59%
were convicted of murder (table 26).

Note:  Data on conviction offense were
available for 100% of cases involving
defendants who had been convicted.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
The biggest drop was in the violent felony category, which
accounted for about 25% of all defendants by arrest charge, but
just 14% of them by conviction charge.  

Much of this change can be accounted for by the fact that about
11% of all defendants were originally facing felony assault
charges, but just 5% of all convictions were for such an
offense.  Overall, 20% of convicted defendants were convicted at
the misdemeanor level, including 38% of those convicted after
being originally charged with felony assault.  

Given arrest, about three-fifths of the defendants whose most
serious arrest charge was for a driving-related offense (59%), a
weapons offense (59%), or drug trafficking (58%) were eventually
convicted of that same offense.  About half of the defendants
originally charged with burglary or theft were eventually convicted 
of those offenses. 

Among defendants whose most serious arrest charge was for a
violent offense, less than half were eventually convicted of
that same felony offense.  About two-fifths of defendants
originally charged with robbery (43%), rape (39%), or murder
(37%) were eventually convicted of those offenses.  About a
fourth of defendants originally charged with felony assault were
eventually convicted of that offense (25%).

Case processing statistics

Among the approximately 46,000 cases with a known adjudication
outcome that occurred within 1 year of arrest, about 30,000 were
disposed by a guilty plea.  About a fourth of these pleas
occurred within 1 month of arrest and about three-fifths within
3 months of arrest.  

The next most common type of adjudication, dismissal of the
charges against the defendant, occurred in about 13,000 cases. 
About half of all dismissals occurred within the first month 
after arrest and three-fourths within 3 months.  

Trials occurred in about 2,400 cases.  About 1 in 10 trials were
completed within a month of arrest and about 1 in 3 within 3 months 
of arrest.  

Guilty pleas accounted for nearly all (94%) of the 32,000
convictions obtained within 1 year of arrest.  This included
about 23,700 felony pleas and about 6,400 misdemeanor pleas. 
About a fourth of the felony pleas occurred within 1 month of
arrest, and more than half were obtained within 3 months of
arrest.  About two-fifths of the misdemeanor pleas were obtained
with 1 month of arrest, and about two-thirds within 3 months.  

Of the approximately 1,900 trial convictions obtained within 1
year, nearly all were for a felony, with just 250 trials
resulting in a misdemeanor conviction.  Nearly a third of all
trial convictions occurred within 3 months of arrest, and almost
two-thirds within 6 months of arrest.

Time from conviction to sentencing

About 2 in 3 convicted defendants were sentenced within 1 day of
adjudication (table 29).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Defendants convicted of a misdemeanor (88%) were more likely to 
be sentenced this quickly than those convicted of a felony (60%). 

Sentencing after a felony conviction was more likely to occur
within 1 day if the conviction was for a nonviolent offense
(62%) than if it was for a violent offense (50%).  Within the
violent offense category, the percentage of convicted defendants
sentenced within 1 day ranged from 34% of those convicted of
murder to 56% of those convicted of felony assault or robbery.

About 5 in 6 convicted defendants received their sentence within
30 days, including 79% of those convicted of a felony and 92% of
those convicted of a misdemeanor.  Nearly all convicted 
defendants were sentenced within 60 days, including 97% of those
convicted of a misdemeanor and 92% of those convicted of a
felony.

Type and length of sentence

About two-thirds of all convicted defendants were sentenced to
incarceration in a State prison or local jail (table 30).

Prison category includes 7 defendants who received a death sentence.  Detail may not add to 
total because of rounding.  
--Less than 0.5%.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 
Sixty-nine percent of the defendants convicted of a felony were
sentenced to incarceration, compared to 57% of those convicted
of a misdemeanor.   

About half of the incarceration sentences following a felony
conviction, 35% of felony sentences overall, were to State
prison.  All murder convictions resulted in a prison sentence,
as did a majority of robbery (71%) and rape (56%) convictions.

Although less than half of defendants convicted of drug
trafficking (44%), burglary (43%), felony assault (40%),or a
weapons offense (37%) were sentenced to prison, this was still
the most likely type of sentence for such defendants. 

Nearly all of the incarceration sentences resulting from a
misdemeanor conviction, 54% of all misdemeanor sentences, were
to jail.  Two-thirds of jail sentences included a probation term
to be served in addition to the jail time.  This was more likely
to be the case for defendants convicted of a felony (75%) than
those convicted of a misdemeanor (39%).
  
Among defendants who were convicted but not sentenced to
incarceration, 98% of those convicted of a felony and 84% of
those convicted of a misdemeanor received a probation term. 
Probation sentences may have included a fine, payment of
restitution, and/or completion of a community service
requirement.

Overall, about a third of convicted defendants received a
sentence to probation (31%) without any incarceration.  About a
third of defendants convicted of theft, a felony drug offense
other than trafficking, a felony public-order offense that was
not driving-related, or a misdemeanor received a probation term
without incarceration. 

An estimated 2% of all defendants, 1% of those convicted of a
felony, were ordered to pay a fine but were not sentenced to a
term of incarceration or probation.  These fines may have been
in addition to court-ordered restitution and/or community
service.

Among persons arrested and charged with a felony by the
prosecutor, murder defendants had the highest probability of
eventually being convicted and sentenced to prison (63%)  
The next highest probability of an eventual prison sentence 
was for defendants charged with robbery (45%).  About a
third of defendants originally charged with drug trafficking
(34%) or rape (33%) were eventually convicted and sentenced to
prison.  Defendants originally charged with felony assault (20%)
or theft (22%) were the least likely to be eventually sentenced
to prison.  

Defendants originally charged with a driving-related offense
(30%), drug trafficking (27%), or burglary (26%) were the most
likely to be eventually convicted and receive a jail sentence. 
No murder defendants were convicted and sentenced to jail.  

A majority of defendants charged with murder (63%), robbery
(63%), drug trafficking (61%), a driving-related offense (59%),
or burglary (56%) were eventually convicted and sentenced to
either prison or jail.  Assault (38%) defendants were the least
likely to be eventually convicted and sentenced to some type of
incarceration.

Among defendants convicted of a felony and sentenced to prison,
the mean sentence was 58 months and the median was 36 months
(table 31).

By general conviction offense category, defendants convicted 
of a violent felony received the longest prison sentences 
(a mean of 93 months and a median of 60 months), and those 
convicted of a public-order felony the shortest (a mean of
34 months and a median of 24 months).  

By specific conviction offense, murderers received the longest
prison terms,   a mean of 435 months and a median of 360 months.
Next were defendants convicted of rape with a mean prison
sentence of 132 months, and a median of 96 months.  

Median sentences for other felony convictions included 60 months
for robbery, 48 months for assault, 42 months for drug
trafficking, 41 months for burglary, 32 months for weapons
offenses, 24 months for theft, and 24 months for driving-related
offenses.  

Twenty-three percent of all murder convictions resulted in a
life sentence, compared to a maximum of 3% of the defendants
convicted of any other offense. In addition to those receiving
life sentences, 69% of the defendants convicted of murder were
sentenced to more than 10 years in prison.  About 1 in 4 rape
convictions, 1 in 6 robbery convictions, and 1 in 10 felony
assault convictions resulted in a prison term of more than 10
years.

For defendants convicted of a felony and subsequently sentenced
to jail, the mean jail term was 6 months and the median was 5
months (table 32).

*Murder and rape have been excluded from the detail because no murder convictions and few rape convictions
resulted in a jail sentence. The total for violent offenses, however, does include these cases.
--Less than 0.5%.
----------------------------------------------------------------

Misdemeanor convictions resulted in a mean jail term of 3 months 
and a median of 2 months.    

Excluding murder (for which all sentences were to prison), and
rape (for which few cases resulted in a jail sentence),
defendants sentenced to jail for robbery received the longest
average sentence (a mean of 9 months and a median of 12 months).
About 2% of all jail sentences for a felony conviction were for
a period greater than 1 year, including 9% of those that
followed a conviction for robbery.  The longest jail sentence
recorded during the study was for about 5 years.

For defendants sentenced to probation without incarceration for
a felony involving a violent, property, or drug offense, the
median sentence length was 36 months.  For felony public-order
convictions, and misdemeanors the median was 24 months (table
33).

Twenty-one percent of offenders sentenced to probation were
required to pay restitution, including 40% of those convicted
for a property-related felony.  Six percent of probation
sentences included a requirement that the defendant enter a drug
treatment program.  Defendants convicted of a drug-related
felony (12%) were the most likely to have this requirement.    

Prior record and felony sentencing

For defendants convicted of a felony on their current charge,
the probability of receiving a sentence to incarceration was
highest if they had multiple prior felony convictions (85%)
(table 35).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Defendants with multiple prior felony convictions and whose
current conviction was for a violent felony were the most likely
of all defendants to be sentenced to incarceration (91%).

About three-fourths of defendants with just one prior felony
conviction (76%) or only prior misdemeanor convictions (72%),
were sentenced to incarceration following a felony conviction in
the current case.  About half of those with no prior convictions
of any type (52%) received an incarceration sentence for a
felony conviction.  

Defendants with no prior convictions whose current felony
conviction was for a property offense were the least likely
overall to be sentenced to incarceration (39%).

A majority (58%) of the defendants with more than one prior
felony conviction were sentenced to prison for a new felony
conviction, including 71% of those whose current conviction was
for a violent offense.  Nearly half (45%) of the defendants with
a single prior felony conviction were sentenced to prison
following a felony conviction in the current case, including 65%
of those convicted of a violent felony.  

Overall, less than a fourth of defendants with no prior felony
convictions  received a prison sentence for a felony conviction
in the current case. How- ever, 40% of the defendants with no
prior felony convictions received a prison sentence if the
current conviction was for a violent felony.  

Defendants with a prior conviction record that consisted of only
misdemeanors were more likely than other defendants to receive a
jail sentence after being convicted of a felony (49%) on the
current charge. This was most likely to be the case if the
current conviction was for a nonviolent offense.

Defendants with no prior convictions of any kind were the most
likely to receive a probation sentence (47%).  Three-fifths of
defendants convicted of a property-related felony and who had no
prior convictions received a probation sentence.

Defendants convicted of a violent felony were much more likely
to be sentenced to prison than jail or probation if they had at
least one prior felony conviction.  Those without a prior  
felony conviction were only slightly more likely to be
sentenced to prison than jail.

Among defendants convicted of a nonviolent felony, prison was
also the most likely sentence for those with prior felony
convictions.  However, this effect was much more pronounced for
those with multiple prior felonies than those with a single
prior felony.  

Jail was the most probable sentence for a nonviolent felony
among defendants who had a prior conviction record that
consisted of only misdemeanors.  Probation was the most likely
sentence if they had no conviction record at all.

Methodology

The SCPS sample was designed and selected by the U.S. Bureau of
the Census under BJS supervision.  It is a 2-stage stratified
sample, with 40 of the 75 most populous counties selected at the
first stage and a systematic sample of State court felony
filings (defendants) within each county selected at the second
stage.  The 40 counties were divided into 4 first-stage strata
based on court filing information obtained through a telephone
survey.  Twelve counties were included in the sample with
certainty because of their large number of court filings.  The
remaining counties were allocated to the three noncertainty
strata based on the variance of felony court dispositions. 

The second-stage sampling (filings) was designed to represent
all defendants who had felony cases filed with the court during
the month of May 1996.  The participating jurisdictions provided
data for every felony case filed on selected days during that
month.  Depending on the first-stage stratum in which it had
been placed, each jurisdiction provided data for 1, 2, or 4
weeks' filings in May 1996.  Data from jurisdictions that were
not required to provide a full month of filings were weighted to
represent the full month (see Appendix table A).

Data on 15,474 sample felony cases were collected from the 40
sampled jurisdictions.  This sample represented 54,579 weighted
cases filed during the month of May 1996 in the 75 most populous
counties.  A small number of  cases (64 unweighted, 244
weighted) were omitted from the analysis because they could not
be classified into one of the four major crime categories
(violent, property, drug, public-order).  

This report is based on data collected from the following
counties and independent cities:  Alabama (Jefferson); Arizona
(Maricopa, Pima); California (Alameda, Los Angeles, Orange,
Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Francisco, Santa Clara,
Ventura); Florida (Broward, Dade, Hillsborough, Orange); Georgia
(Fulton); Hawaii (Honolulu); Illinois (Cook, DuPage); Indiana
(Marion); Kentucky (Jefferson); Maryland (Baltimore (city));
Michigan (Wayne); Missouri (Jackson, St. Louis); New York
(Bronx, Erie, Kings, Monroe, New York, Queens, Suffolk); Ohio
(Hamilton); Pennsylvania (Allegheny, Philadelphia); Tennessee
(Shelby); Texas (Dallas, Harris); Washington (King); and
Wisconsin (Milwaukee).

Because the data came from a sample, a sampling error (standard
error) is associated with each reported number.  In general, if
the difference between two numbers is greater than twice the
standard error for that difference, we can say that we are 95%
confident of a real difference and that the apparent difference
is not simply the result of using a sample rather than the
entire population.  All differences discussed in this report
were statistically significant at or above the 95-percent
confidence level.

Race and Hispanic origin

Several jurisdictions did not provide complete reporting for
defendants' Hispanic origin.  As a result, the overall reporting
level for race combined with  Hispanic origin was 79%, compared
to 90% for race alone.  Because of this underreporting, the
categories of race alone account for more defendants than the
categories that include both race and Hispanic origin.  A large
preponderance of the defendants with a Hispanic origin were
white, although the category includes all races. 

Offense categories 

Felony offenses were classified into 13 categories for this
report.  These categories were further divided into the four
major crime categories of violent, property, drug, and
public-order offenses.  The following listings contain a
representative summary of most of the crimes contained in each
category; however, these lists are not meant to be exhaustive. 
All offenses, except for murder, include attempts and
conspiracies to commit.

Violent offenses

Murder -- Includes homicide, nonnegligent manslaughter, and
voluntary homicide.  Does not include attempted murder
(classified as felony assault), negligent homicide, involuntary
homicide, or vehicular manslaughter, which are classified as
other violent offenses.

Rape -- Includes forcible intercourse, sodomy, or penetration
with a foreign object.  Does not include statutory rape or
nonforcible acts with a minor or someone unable to give legal
consent, nonviolent sexual offenses, or commercialized sex
offenses.

Robbery -- Includes the unlawful taking of anything of value by
force or threat of force.

Assault -- Includes aggravated assault, aggravated battery,
attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon, felony assault
or battery on a law enforcement officer, and other felony
assaults.  Does not include extortion, coercion, or intimidation.

Other violent offenses -- Includes vehicular manslaughter, involuntary
manslaughter, negligent or reckless homicide, nonviolent or nonforcible
sexual assault, kidnaping, unlawful imprisonment, child or spouse abuse,
cruelty to a child, reckless endangerment, hit-and-run with bodily
injury, intimidation, and extortion.

Property offenses

Burglary -- Includes any type of entry into a residence,
industry, or business with or without the use of force with the
intent to commit a felony or theft.  Does not include possession
of burglary tools, trespassing, or unlawful entry for which the
intent is not known.

Theft -- Includes grand theft, grand larceny, motor vehicle
theft, and any other felony theft.  Does not include receiving
or buying stolen property, fraud, forgery, or deceit.

Other property offenses -- Includes receiving or buying stolen
property, forgery, fraud, embezzlement, arson, reckless burning,
damage to property, criminal mischief, vandalism, bad checks,
counterfeiting, criminal trespassing, possession of burglary
tools, and unlawful entry.

Drug offenses

Drug trafficking -- Includes trafficking, sales, distribution,
possession with intent to distribute or sell, manufacturing, and
smuggling of controlled substances.  Does not include possession
of controlled substances.

Other drug offenses -- Includes possession of controlled
substances, prescription violations, possession of drug
paraphernalia, and other drug law violations. 

Public-order offenses

Weapons -- Includes the unlawful sale, distribution,
manufacture, alteration, transportation, possession, or use of a
deadly weapon or accessory.

Driving-related -- Includes driving under the influence of drugs
or alcohol, driving with a suspended or revoked license, and any
other felony in the motor vehicle code.

Other public-order offenses -- Includes flight/escape, parole or
probation violations, prison contraband, habitual offender,
obstruction of justice, rioting, libel, slander, treason,
perjury, prostitution/pandering, bribery, and tax law violations.

Terms related to pretrial release

Released defendant -- Includes any defendant who was released
from custody prior to the disposition of his or her case by the
court.  Includes defendants who were detained for some period of
time before being released and defendants who were returned to
custody after being released because of a violation of the
conditions of pretrial release.  The terms "on pretrial release"
and "released pending disposition" are both used in this report
to refer to all released defendants.

Detained defendant -- Includes any defendant who remained in
custody from the time of arrest until the disposition of his or
her case by the court.  This report also refers to detained
defendants as "not released."

Failure to appear -- Occurs when a court issues a bench warrant
for a defendant's arrest because he or she has missed a
scheduled court appearance.

Types of financial release

Surety bond -- A bail bond company signs a promissory note to
the court for the full bail amount and charges the defendant a
fee for the service (usually 10% of the full bail amount).  If
the defendant fails to appear, the bond company is liable to the
court for the full bail amount.  Frequently the bond company
requires collateral from the defendant in addition to the fee.

Deposit bond --The defendant deposits a percentage (usually 10%)
of the full bail amount with the court.  The percentage of the
bail is returned after the disposition of the case, but the
court often retains a small portion for administrative costs. 
If the defendant fails to appear in court, he or she is liable
to the court for the full amount of the bail. 

Full cash bond -- The defendant posts the full bail amount in
cash with the court.  If the defendant makes all court
appearances, the cash is returned.  If the defendant fails to
appear in court, the bond is forfeited.

Property bond -- Involves an agreement made by a defendant as a
condition of pretrial release requiring that property valued at
the full bail amount be posted as an assurance of his or her
appearance in court.  If the defendant fails to appear in court,
the property is forfeited.  Also known as "collateral bond."

Types of nonfinancial release

Release on recognizance (ROR) --The court releases the defendant
on a signed agreement that he or she will appear in court as
required.  In this report, the ROR category includes citation
releases in which arrestees are released pending their first
court appearance on a written order issued by law enforcement or
jail personnel. 

Unsecured bond -- The defendant pays no money to the court but
is liable for the full amount of bail should he or she fail to
appear in court.

Conditional release -- Defendants are released under conditions
and are usually monitored or supervised by a pretrial services
agency.  In some cases, such as those involving a third-party
custodian or drug monitoring and treatment, another agency may
be involved in the supervision of the defendant.  Conditional
release sometimes includes an unsecured bond.

Other type of release

Emergency release -- Defendants are released in response to a
court order placing limits on a jail's population.
