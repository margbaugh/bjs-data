---------------------------------------------------

This report provides an update to annual tables based on the
Bureau of Justice Statistics' (BJS) Deaths in Custody
Reporting Program (DCRP), a data collection that measures
inmate mortality data in state prisons and local jails by the
number and causes of deaths. In 2008, 960 inmates died in
U.S. jails (a mortality rate of 123 deaths per 100,000 jail
inmates). In 2009, 948 inmates died in U.S. jails (a rate of
127 deaths per 100,000 jail inmates). State prison facilities
reported 3,452 inmate deaths in 2008 (a rate of 260 deaths
per 100,000 prison inmates) and 3,408 inmate deaths in 2009
(257 deaths per 100,000 prison inmates). Consistent with data
from previous years, local jail deaths constituted
approximately 25% of inmate deaths in adult correctional
facilities nationwide.

The number of inmate deaths in jails increased each year
between 2000 and 2007 (from 904 to 1,102 inmate deaths),
increasing 22% during this period. In 2008, the number of
deaths in jails declined 13% to 960 inmate deaths, and
decreased an additional 1% in 2009 to 948 deaths (figure 1).
The decline in 2008 was the first decline in jail mortality
data since BJS began collecting data annually for the DCRP in
2000. 

From 2007 to 2008, 918 jails reported a change in the
number of deaths to the DCRP. Among these jails, 324 reported
a total increase of 452 deaths and 402 jails reported a total
decrease of 594 deaths, for a net decrease of 142 deaths in
2008. The majority of jails reporting a decline (74%)
registered one less death in 2008 than in 2007. Nine jails
reported a total decrease of 69 deaths (12% of the total
decline). All nine of these jails held at least 2,500 inmates
on an average day in 2007 and 2008.

In general, the number of deaths in state prisons rose each
year between 2001 and 2008 (from 2,877 to 3,452 inmate
deaths), a 20% increase (figure 2). In 2009, the number of
deaths in prisons dropped to 3,408, a 1% decrease.     


Statistical tables in this report detail prison and jail
deaths in custody. The tables present mortality data
by cause of death, selected decedent characteristics,
and state.

SUMMARY FINDINGS: Jails

Cause of death

* After increasing an average of 3% annually between 2000
and 2007, the number of inmate deaths in jails declined
13% in 2008. In 2009, the number of jail deaths remained
relatively stable (down 1% from 2008) (table 1).

* Among the causes of inmate deaths in jails, AIDS-related
deaths had the largest decline, decreasing by more than
half (54%) between 2000 and 2009.

* Between 2000 and 2009, suicide (29%) and heart
disease (22%) were the leading causes of deaths in jails,
accounting for over half (51%) of all deaths in jails (table
2).

* Death by drug or alcohol intoxication (7%) was the third
leading single cause of death in jails between 2000 and
2009. No other single cause of death accounted for more
than 5% of jail deaths during this period.

* Suicide rates in jails dropped every year between 2001 and
2007 (from 49 to 36 deaths per 100,000), before increasing
in 2009 (41 deaths per 100,000) (table 3).

* The jail mortality rate declined 13% between 2007 and
2008 (from 141 to 123 deaths per 100,000 jail inmates).
The mortality rate increased in 2009 (127 deaths per
100,000), but this rate was still lower than the rate in
2007.

Decedent characteristics

* Males constituted 88% of the jail population and 88% of
jail deaths over the 10-year period. Females (132 deaths
per 100,000) and males (141 deaths per 100,000) died at
nearly equal rates between 2000 and 2009 (table 4).

* Whites (43% of the jail population) had a mortality rate
in jails between 1.6 and 4.7 times that of any other race or
ethnic group.

* American Indians and Alaska Natives accounted for about
2% of jail deaths, and Asians, Hawaiians, or other Pacific
Islanders accounted for less than 1% of deaths in jails
between 2000 and 2009 (table 5).

* Between 2000 and 2009, jail inmates age 55 or older were
between 5 and 7 times more likely to die than inmates age
54 or younger. During this period, the annual mortality
rate for jail inmates age 55 or older ranged from 666 to
870 deaths per 100,000 (table 6).

State-level jail populations

* California, Texas, New York, and Florida reported 35%
of all jail deaths. These states also had the largest jail
populations and averaged 32% of the total jail average
daily population reported to the DCRP between 2000 and
2009 (table 7).

* Between 2000 and 2009, nearly all (from 97% to 99%)
of the approximately 2,800 jail jurisdictions in the U.S.
submitted population and mortality data to the DCRP.
These jurisdictions reported a total of 10,005 deaths over
the ten-year period (table 9).

Cause of death by decedent characteristics

* Males accounted for 98% of homicides in jails between
2000 and 2009 (table 11).

* Between 2000 and 2009, males committed suicide
(43 deaths per 100,000) at a higher rate than females
(27 deaths per 100,000) in jails. Over this period,
males were 1.6 times more likely to die by suicide than
females, and females were 1.7 times more likely to die by
intoxication than males (table 12).

* Between 2000 and 2009, whites had the highest suicide
rate in jail (80 deaths per 100,000). Hispanics/Latinos
(25 deaths per 100,000) were 3 times less likely to commit
suicide than whites in jails and 1.6 times more likely to
commit suicide in jails than blacks/African Americans
(16 deaths per 100,000).

* White, black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino
inmates had equal homicide rates in jails (3 deaths
per 100,000).

* In jails, the oldest inmates (age 55 or older) and the
youngest inmates (age 17 or younger) had the highest
suicide mortality rates (60 and 55 deaths per 100,000,
respectively). Jail inmates age 55 or older were 3 times
more likely than younger inmates to die of an accident.

Cause of death

* After increasing an average of 3% annually between 2000
and 2007, the number of inmate deaths in jails declined
13% in 2008. In 2009, the number of jail deaths remained
relatively stable (down 1% from 2008) (table 1).

* Among the causes of inmate deaths in jails, AIDS-related
deaths had the largest decline, decreasing by more than
half (54%) between 2000 and 2009.

* Between 2000 and 2009, suicide (29%) and heart
disease (22%) were the leading causes of deaths in jails,
accounting for over half (51%) of all deaths in jails (table
2).

* Death by drug or alcohol intoxication (7%) was the third
leading single cause of death in jails between 2000 and
2009. No other single cause of death accounted for more
than 5% of jail deaths during this period.

* Suicide rates in jails dropped every year between 2001 and
2007 (from 49 to 36 deaths per 100,000), before increasing
in 2009 (41 deaths per 100,000) (table 3).

* The jail mortality rate declined 13% between 2007 and
2008 (from 141 to 123 deaths per 100,000 jail inmates).
The mortality rate increased in 2009 (127 deaths per
100,000), but this rate was still lower than the rate in
2007.

Decedent characteristics

* Males constituted 88% of the jail population and 88% of
jail deaths over the 10-year period. Females (132 deaths
per 100,000) and males (141 deaths per 100,000) died at
nearly equal rates between 2000 and 2009 (table 4).

* Whites (43% of the jail population) had a mortality rate
in jails between 1.6 and 4.7 times that of any other race or
ethnic group.

* American Indians and Alaska Natives accounted for about
2% of jail deaths, and Asians, Hawaiians, or other Pacific
Islanders accounted for less than 1% of deaths in jails
between 2000 and 2009 (table 5).

* Between 2000 and 2009, jail inmates age 55 or older were
between 5 and 7 times more likely to die than inmates age
54 or younger. During this period, the annual mortality
rate for jail inmates age 55 or older ranged from 666 to
870 deaths per 100,000 (table 6).

State-level jail populations

* California, Texas, New York, and Florida reported 35%
of all jail deaths. These states also had the largest jail
populations and averaged 32% of the total jail average
daily population reported to the DCRP between 2000 and
2009 (table 7).

* Between 2000 and 2009, nearly all (from 97% to 99%)
of the approximately 2,800 jail jurisdictions in the U.S.
submitted population and mortality data to the DCRP.
These jurisdictions reported a total of 10,005 deaths over
the ten-year period (table 9).

Cause of death by decedent characteristics

* Males accounted for 98% of homicides in jails between
2000 and 2009 (table 11).

* Between 2000 and 2009, males committed suicide (43 deaths
per 100,000) at a higher rate than females (27 deaths per
100,000) in jails. Over this period, males were 1.6 times
more likely to die by suicide than females, and females were
1.7 times more likely to die by intoxication than males
(table 12).

* Between 2000 and 2009, whites had the highest suicide
rate in jail (80 deaths per 100,000). Hispanics/Latinos
(25 deaths per 100,000) were 3 times less likely to commit
suicide than whites in jails and 1.6 times more likely to
commit suicide in jails than blacks/African Americans
(16 deaths per 100,000).

* White, black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino
inmates had equal homicide rates in jails (3 deaths
per 100,000).

* In jails, the oldest inmates (age 55 or older) and the
youngest inmates (age 17 or younger) had the highest
suicide mortality rates (60 and 55 deaths per 100,000,
respectively). Jail inmates age 55 or older were 3 times
more likely than younger inmates to die of an accident.

SUMMARY FINDINGS: Prisons

Cause of Death

* In general, the number of deaths in prisons increased
each year between 2001 and 2008, increasing 20% during
this period. Between 2008 and 2009, both the number
of deaths and mortality rates remained relatively stable,
declining 1% each (table 13). 

* Among the causes of inmate deaths in prisons, AIDS related
deaths had the largest decline (down 65%) between 2001 and 2009.

* Between 2001 and 2009, illness-related deaths accounted
for 9 out of 10 prison deaths (table 14).

* Heart disease (26%) and cancer (23%) were the leading
single causes of illness-related deaths in prisons, together
accounting for nearly half (49%) of all prison deaths
between 2001 and 2009.

* Liver disease was the third leading single cause of death
in prisons, accounting for 7% of all deaths.

* Deaths due to intoxication, homicide, or accident were
the least common causes of deaths, with none accounting
for more than 2% of deaths in prisons.

Decedent characteristics

* On average, males constituted 96% of the prison
population over the 9-year period and 93% of all prison
deaths (table 17).

* Prison inmates age 55 or older accounted for 41% of
prison deaths but comprised 5% of the total prison
population for the 9-year period.

* Whites made up 37% of the prison population and 50% of
deaths in prisons between 2001 and 2009. White mortality
rates were between 1.4 and 1.8 times higher than other
race or ethnic groups during the 9-year period.

* Between 2001 and 2009, males in prisons died at rate of
260 deaths per 100,000, while females died at a rate of 153
deaths per 100,000 (table 19).

* During the 9-year period of prison data collection, the
annual mortality rates for inmates age 55 or older ranged
between 2,007 and 2,500 deaths per 100,000.

State-level prison populations

* All 50 (100%) state departments of corrections
participated in the DCRP between 2001 and 2009
(table 20).

* California, Texas, Florida, and New York had the four
largest correctional populations in the United States. They
averaged 37% of the total prison population and reported
37% of deaths to the DCRP between 2001 and 2009.

Cause of death by decedent characteristics

* Males accounted for more than 99% of prison homicides
between 2001 and 2009 (table 23).

* With the exception of deaths due to drug or alcohol
intoxication, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians,
Hawaiians, or other Pacific Islanders each accounted for
less than 1% of all deaths in prisons between 2001 and
2009.

* American Indians and Alaska Natives accounted for 3.1%
of all drug or alcohol intoxication deaths in state prisons
between 2001 and 2009.

* Males were twice as likely (19 deaths per 100,000) as
females (8 deaths per 100,000) to die from liver disease.
Males were 1.5 times more likely to commit suicide than
females in prison between 2001 and 2009 (table 24).

* Blacks/African Americans accounted for 68% of AIDS related
deaths and died from AIDS at a rate (21 per
100,000) that was three times that of whites (7 per
100,000) and twice that of Hispanics/Latinos (10 per
100,000) between 2001 and 2009.

* Inmates age 55 or older had the highest mortality rates
due to heart disease (664 deaths per 100,000), cancer
(639 deaths per 100,000), and liver disease (113 deaths
per 100,000) over the entire 9-year DCRP collection.

* Prison inmates age 55 or older had the highest homicide
rate (8 deaths per 100,000), which was between 1.6
and 2.7 times higher than any other age group from
2001 to 2009.

Methodology

The Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP) is an
annual data collection conducted by the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS). The DCRP collects data on persons who
have died while in the custody of the 50 state departments
of correction and in the roughly 3,000 local adult jail
jurisdictions nationwide.

The DCRP began in 2000 under the Death in Custody Reporting
Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-297). It is the only national
statistical collection that obtains detailed information
about deaths in adult correctional facilities. BJS uses DCRP
datato report national trends in the number and causes (or
manners) of deaths occurring in state prison or local jail
custody.

Information about decedents collected for the DCRP include
selected demographic characteristics, such as sex, age,
race, and Hispanic ethnicity; facility type of death (prison
or jail); date of admission; conviction status; admission
offense; circumstances surrounding the death, including
cause of death, time and location of death; and information
on whether an autopsy was conducted and the availability
of results to the respondent. In cases of illness deaths, the
DCRP collects data on whether the decedent had a preexisting
condition and whether he or she received medical treatment
for this condition prior to death.

Executions are collected under the separate BJS Capital
Punishment series. Data on executions are accessible through
the BJS website at www.bjs.gov.

Statistics presented in this report are current as of
September 1, 2011. DCRP mortality data are accessible on
the BJS website.

For more information on mortality in correctional settings,
see Mortality in Local Jails, 2000-2007 (NCJ 222988, BJS
Web, July 2010); Medical Causes of Death in State Prisons,
2001-2004 (NCJ 216340, BJS Web, January 2007); and
Suicide and Homicide in State Prisons and Local Jails
(NCJ 210036, BJS Web, August 2005).

Scope of the DCRP

The prison component of the DCRP collects data on inmate
deaths occurring in the 50 state departments of corrections
while inmates are in the physical custody of prison
officials. Starting in 2001 and annually thereafter, BJS has
collected DCRP data directly from state prison systems.
Since beginning the collection, BJS has maintained a 100%
response rate from the state prison system respondents to
the DCRP.

The DCRP's jail component includes inmate deaths occurring in
all local adult jail jurisdictions nationwide. A jail
jurisdiction is a legal entity that has responsibility for
managing jail facilities. Jail jurisdictions typically
operate at the county level, in which a sheriff or executive
manages the local facilities. The DCRP data identify the
facilities in which a jail death occurs, but the DCRP data
are arrayed at the jail jurisdiction level. BJS defines a
jail as locally-operated correctional facility that confines
persons before or after adjudication for more than 72 hours.
BJS does not include temporary lockups in its definition of
jail facilities. Typically, there is one facility per jail
jurisdiction, but the 2006 Census of Jail Facilities found
that 15% of jail jurisdictions had multiple facilities under
its authority. See the BJS website for more information.

The jail universe file includes all currently operating jails
as well as jails that have closed, consolidated, or otherwise
eliminated operations. The most recent jail universe,
constructed in 2009, identified 2,825 jurisdictions,
representing 3,223 jail facilities. Of these, 2,755 (97.5%)
participated in the 2009 DCRP.

Administration of the DCRP

The DCRP collection forms are provided annually to state
prison and local jail respondents. Respondents provide an
aggregate count of the number of deaths occurring during
the referenced calendar year, in addition to individuallevel
decedent data. For state prison system respondents,
aggregate counts are obtained through the NPS-4 (available
at http://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/nps410.pdf). For local
jails, aggregate counts of deaths are obtained through the
CJ-9A  (available at  
http://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cj9a10.pdf).

BJS requests jail administrators to provide statistics about
their population and bookings through the summary form in
addition to a death count. All jails, even those with no
deaths to report, a scenario that applies to about 80% of jails 
in any given year, are asked to complete the annual summary form.

BJS obtains a separate report describing the decedent's
characteristics and the circumstances surrounding the death
for each death occurring in a state prison or local jail. The
survey forms used to obtain data on each prison and jail
death are available on the BJS website:

* Prison deaths (NPS-4A form): 
http://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/nps4a10.pdf

* Jail deaths (CJ-9):
http://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cj910.pdf

State prison and local jail respondents may submit individual
records on decedents at any time during a collection cycle
through a BJS web-based collection system, accessible on the
BJS website at https://bjsdcrp.rti.org/.

BJS has modified the survey forms slightly over time. Most
of the changes have been minor and intended to clarify
existing questions and ease respondent burden.

In 2001, additional items on medical treatment in prisons
and jails were added to collect data on medical treatment
received by the inmate prior to death. Text boxes added
to the forms in 2008 allowed respondents to elaborate on
deaths due to intoxication, suicide, and inmate-involved
homicide. Such fields had previously only been available
for deaths due to illness, accident, homicide not caused by
other inmates, and other unspecified reasons. BJS removed
a question measuring the conviction status of an inmate
(since more than 99% of prison inmates were convicted at
the time of their deaths). BJS also changed the survey layout
in 2009 to simplify the progression through questions related
to autopsies. The revised item instructed respondents to
complete the entire form after autopsy results were available
(rather than submitting an initially-incomplete form where
autopsy results were pending).

Determining eligibility for reporting to the DCRP

In the DCRP, custody refers to the holding of an inmate
in a facility or while a correctional authority maintains
a chain of custody over an inmate. For instance, if a jail
transports an ill inmate to a hospital for medical services
and that inmate dies while in the chain of custody of the
jail, that death is counted as a death in the DCRP. A death
that occurs when an inmate is not in the custody of
correctional authority is considered to be beyond the scope
of the DCRP. This includes deaths of inmates on escape status
and those serving time on community corrections (probation,
parole, or home-electronic monitoring). Legal executions are
also beyond the scope of the DCRP. For more information on
executions, see the Capital Punishment series on the BJS
website.

BJS instructs both state prison and local jail officials to
determine first whether the inmate was in the physical
custody of the jurisdiction at the time of death, regardless
of the reason an inmate was being held. For state prisons,
this includes the deaths of inmates held in any private
prison facility under contract to the department of
corrections as well as deaths in any of their state-operated
facilities, including halfway houses, prison camps or farms,
training or treatment centers, and prison hospitals.

BJS instructs state prison officials to exclude deaths
of inmates who were transferred to local jails due to
overcrowding or other reasons but who were still serving
a prison term. The DCRP obtains information about these
deaths through the jail reports. For jails, deaths in custody
includes deaths of inmates who were temporarily out of the
physical custody of a facility but within the chain of
custody of the jail. Typically, these include deaths of jail
inmates who have been transferred to offsite facilities that
care for critically-ill persons. Over half (51%) of jail
inmate deaths occurred in medical facilities outside of the
jail facility between 2000 and 2009.

Custody is further complicated by the dual law enforcement
and jail administration functions of some sheriffs'
departments. As a result, some deaths reported as jail deaths
actually occurred before the jail had custody of the
decedent. BJS excludes these deaths in the process of arrest
by using information about the circumstances surrounding the
death.

Identifying and excluding duplicates

Duplicate death records may exist in DCRP due to overlapping
correctional populations as well as overlapping duties within
correctional facilities. For example, a jail jurisdiction may
have more than one reporting unit responsible for reporting
data to BJS, or a jail may be holding a state prison inmate.
Multiple reporting entities may report the same death, or
state prison systems may report on the death of an inmate who
was transferred to a local jail but was serving a prison
sentence at the time.

BJS' process for identifying duplicate death records is
as follows: First, BJS reconciles the aggregate summary
counts of deaths occurring during a calendar year with
the number of individual death records obtained from a
reporting jurisdiction. When BJS identifies discrepancies,
it contacts reporting jurisdictions for clarification.
Second, BJS performs record-matching to identify duplicate
records within jurisdictions. The matching is based on inmate
name and date of birth, date of death, and date of admission
to the facility. BJS' review of death records between 2000
and 2009 found 83 jail and 294 prison deaths to be duplicates
or beyond the scope of DCRP. These records were excluded
from all DCRP analyses.

Cause of death information

BJS aims to collect accurate information about the cause
of death. The instructions for completing the DCRP tell
respondents to report death information as determined by
an autopsy or other official medical death investigation.
Death by intoxication, accident, suicide, and homicide
are considered discrete causes of death. While there is a
distinction between manner and cause of death from a
medico-legal standpoint, no such distinction is made in the
DCRP. When reporting deaths due to accident or homicide,
BJS requests respondents to describe the events surrounding
these deaths. BJS added a text field to the survey forms so
that respondents could provide more detailed information
on suicide and intoxication deaths. See Administration of the
DCRP.

Due to the variation in deaths caused by illness,
respondents report the cause of death as determined by
an autopsy. These causes are later converted by clinical
data specialists into standard medical codes according to
the World Health Organization's International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems,
Tenth Revision (ICD-10).

Other BJS Sources of Correctional Mortality Data 

BJS maintains other data collections on correctional
mortality and deaths in the process of arrest. These other
collections include--

* Capital Punishment, which provides data on legal
executions. (See the BJS website for further discussion of
executions.)

* The National Prisoner Statistics (NPS), which prior
to the establishment of the DCRP, annually collected
aggregate counts of deaths in state and federal prisons.
Prior to 2007, the NPS collected aggregate counts of
deaths occurring in state and federal prisons, and counts
of deaths by broad categories of death, specifically
deaths due to execution, illness, AIDS, suicide, accident,
homicide, and other causes. After 2007, the Federal
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) continued to submit the counts
of deaths for these broad categories while state prison
officials no longer provided counts of deaths via the NPS.
(See the BJS website for further discussion of the NPS.)

* The Census of Jail Inmates, which is conducted every five
to six years and provides counts of inmate deaths in local
jails. (See the BJS website for further discussion of the
Census of Jail Inmates).

* The Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC), which
provides aggregate counts of the number of deaths
occurring in Indian country correctional facilities
operated by tribal authorities or the U.S. Department of
Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs. (See the BJS website
for further discussion of the SJIC.)

* Arrest-Related Deaths (ARD), which obtains data on
deaths occurring during the process of arrest. BJS relies
on state-level respondents to provide details of deaths
occurring during arrest. (See the BJS website for further
discussion of ARD.)

Reported statistics

Mortality rates are calculated per 100,000 inmates where
the denominators provide estimates of the number of
person-years of exposure in custody in institutional
corrections. The mortality rate for state prisons is
calculated as the number of deaths per year divided by the
midyear state prison population in custody multiplied by
100,000. Midyear custody counts for state prisons provide
estimates for person-years for prison populations. BJS uses
data from its National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) collection
to provide midyear custody counts of prisoners. For more
information on the NPS, see the BJS website.

The mortality rate in local jails is calculated as the number
of deaths per year divided by the average daily jail inmate
population (ADP) multiplied by 100,000. The ADP for local
jails is defined as the average daily number of jail inmates
held in a jail jurisdiction during a calendar year. The use
of the ADP as the denominator for jail mortality rates is
based on the high turnover and daily fluctuation in local
jail populations. The ADP better reflects the number of
inmate days per year than does any one day count. 

The jail ADP also reflects the annual number of admissions
and mean length of stay, and can be expressed as the product
of these two values. When mean length of stay is expressed in
years, the ADP is equivalent to the number of person-years
spent by jail inmates during a given year. Starting in 2002,
BJS collected the ADP directly from respondents using the
summary form, CJ-9. Prior to 2002, BJS calculated the jail
ADP by taking the average of the January 1st count and the
December 31st count from the reference year, which is a proxy
measure for ADP.

Both denominators provide data for annualizing mortality
rates, which are calculated separately for each key
statistic, by group or by characteristic. The annualized
mortality rates by cause of death in state prisons and local
jails are comparable to annual crude mortality rates reported
by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). NCHS
calculates crude mortality rates as the number of events for
a period (e.g., year) divided by the population estimate at
the midpoint of the period. For general population mortality
statistics, NCHS employs the midyear population as an
approximation to the average population exposed to risk
of death during any given year. (For more information, see
Siegal, J. & Swanson, D. (2004), The Methods and Materials
of Demography, Second Edition, San Diego, CA: Elsevier
Academic Press, p. 269.)

The crude mortality rates reported in the DCRP annual
statistical tables for particular segments of the
incarcerated population are not directly comparable to the
crude mortality rates within the (non-incarcerated) general
population. In addition, the crude mortality rates in state
prisons are not directly comparable to those of local jails.
Since the age, race, and sex composition of the general
population differs from that in state prisons and local
jails, and since mortality is correlated with age, race, and
sex, the crude mortality rates in state prisons and local
jails should not be compared directly to one another, or to
the general population.

Estimating inmate population characteristics for use in
calculating mortality rates by demographic subgroups

BJS does not obtain annual data for all demographic
characteristics of prison and jail inmates in all
jurisdictions. BJS uses data from sources other than the DCRP
to estimate the nationwide age, race, and sex composition of
state prison and local jail inmate populations. These data
sources consist primarily of periodic surveys of inmates in
custody in prisons and jails. The inmate characteristic
distributions obtained from these surveys are applied to
denominators (counts of inmates or ADP) to estimate the
number of inmates in each demographic subgroup.

BJS estimated the demographic distribution of the state
prison population data from the National Prisoner Statistics
(NPS) and National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP)
collections. For a discussion on the methodology for
obtaining estimates of the age, race, and sex distributions
of state prisoners, see Prisoners in 2009 (NCJ 231675, BJS
web, December 2010).

Prior BJS reports of mortality rates for state prison inmates
used demographic distributions derived from BJS' 2004
Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional
Facilities (SISCF). Consequently, the state prison mortality
rates shown in these tables may differ from previously
published rates. A rate comparison between the two sources
showed very little difference in the resultant mortality
rates. In most instances, the rates either matched or nearly
matched.

To estimate the distributions of demographic attributes of
the ADP for local jail inmates, BJS used data from several
surveys to generate distributions of age, race, and sex, and
applied these distributions to the ADP. BJS' Annual Survey
of Jails (ASJ) provided estimates of the race, ethnic, and
sex distribution of local jail inmates for each year of the
DCRP collection and applied these to each year's ADP from the
DCRP to estimate the average daily population of persons in
these demographic categories. For more information on the
ASJ, see Jail Inmates at Midyear 2010 -- Statistical Tables
(NCJ 233431, BJS Web, April 2011).

Unlike sex and race/ethnicity data, BJS does not annually
collect data on age in jail populations. BJS obtained
estimates of the age distribution of jail inmates from the
2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (SILJ) and the 2007 and
2008-09 National Inmate Survey (NIS) available on the BJS
website. For more information about jail inmates, see Profile
of Jail Inmates, 2002 (NCJ 201932, BJS Web, July 2004).

To estimate the age distribution of the jail inmate
population, we first obtained an estimate of the number of
jail inmates under age 18 from the Annual Survey of Jails
(ASJ). Between 2000 and 2010, the number of jail inmates
under age 18 has ranged between 6,100 and 7,615, according
to Jail Inmates at Midyear 2010 (table 6). By applying the
annual percentage of jail inmates under age 18 to the annual
average daily jail inmate population, we estimated the
average daily population of jail inmates under age 18.

To estimate the age distribution of adult jail inmates, BJS
used data from the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (SILJ)
and the National Inmate Survey (NIS). We used the SILJ
estimates to cover the period from 2000 to 2006 and the NIS
estimates to cover the period from 2007 to 2009. In each
case, we applied the percentages associated with each age
category to the adults in jail average daily population.

Random error and suppression

The DCRP data on deaths in state prisons and local jails are
not subject to sampling error. However, mortality data from
a complete or near complete enumeration may be subject to
random error. Following Brillinger and NCHS, "the number
of deaths that actually occurred may be considered as one of
a large series of possible results that could have arisen
under the same set of circumstances" (NCHS, 2007). The random
variation can be large when the number of deaths is small;
hence, considerable caution is warranted when interpreting
statistics based on small numbers of deaths. According
to NCHS standards, mortality rates based on fewer than
100 deaths per year should be interpreted with caution.
For more information on vital rates, see Brillinger, D. R.
(1986), "The natural variability of vital rates and
associated statistics," Biometrics 42:693-734. See also the
National Vital Statistics Reports. Deaths: Final Data for
2007, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National
Center for Health Statistics, retrieved from
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr58/nvsr58_19.pdf.

Further following NCHS and Brillinger, we quantify random
variation by assuming that the appropriate underlying
distribution is a Poisson probability distribution. This
provides for a computationally simple as well as reasonable
approach to estimate variances for mortality statistics when
the probability of dying is low. We calculated variances
based on the assumption of a Poisson process and from these
variances calculated relative random error estimates, which
are comparable to relative standard error, in that the
relative random error is the ratio of random error derived
from the Poisson variance to the number of deaths. Following
NCHS, when the relative random error exceeded 30%, we flagged
estimated mortality rates due to the instability of the rate.

Survey performance issues

Survey administration and modifications to the survey
form generated data for years 2007 through 2009 that may
not be wholly compatible with prior DCRP data. In 2007,
state prison officials categorized a large number of illness
deaths as all other illnesses, which led to a high degree of
missing data on illness causes of death. In 2008, local jail
officials were unable to provide causes of death for 22% of
jail inmate deaths. During 2009, BJS made modifications to
the collection instruments to improve reporting and reduce
burden.

* Item nonresponse in 2007: The number of illness deaths
categorized as all other illnesses was overstated in the
2007 prison death reports. This arose from a high degree
of item nonresponse in the text box requesting specific
illness designation on the prisoner death form (NPS-4A).
Since the "all other illnesses" category included unknown
or unspecified illnesses, we were able to classify deaths
within this broad category into specific causes when
respondents reported an illness death and the additional
cause of death information. Throughout the DCRP prison
collection, state departments of corrections respondents
were unable to provide more detailed information on an
average of 17 illness deaths per year between 2001 and 2006.
During 2007, this frequency increased to 173 deaths. Since
many of these deaths would likely have been classified in the
most common illness categories (e.g., heart disease, cancer,
or liver disease), the number of known illness deaths was low
in 2007 relative to prior years. The distribution of illness
deaths in state prisons during 2007 reflect only the deaths
for which specific illness determinations could be made.

* Item nonresponse in 2008 jail data and unknown cause
of death: An abnormally large number of cases were missing a
response for cause of death in the 2008 jail file (n=209;
21.8% of all jail deaths in 2008). This coincided with the
final year the U.S. Census Bureau acted as the data
collection agent for DCRP. In prior years of the DCRP jail
data collection, an average of 6% of all deaths were
classified as having other or unknown causes of death. For
the purposes of this report, BJS categorized the cause of
death for these 209 jail deaths from 2008 as other/unknown.

* 2009 data collection: Prior to the 2009 DCRP collection,
BJS reviewed the data collection instrument, data
submission procedures, and assessed the communications
with DCRP respondents with the goal to reduce burden
on respondents. This resulted in modifications to th
survey instrument to facilitate the online data collection
tool to encourage online response. These modifications
led to delays in implementing the collection. As a result,
individual death reports were collected retrospectively for
the first time, rather than in the year the death occurred.
