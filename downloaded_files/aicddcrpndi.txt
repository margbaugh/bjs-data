Introduction
********************

The U.S. Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS) has collected data annually on inmates who died in
state prison and local jail and the circumstances surrounding
these deaths since the Death in Custody Reporting Act (P. L. 106–
297) was passed in 2000. There were no standardized requirements 
for prison and jail administrators to report inmate deaths prior 
to the passage of the act.

Under BJS’s Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP), 
respondents from jails and state departments of corrections are 
asked to report causes of deaths (COD), identifiers, and 
characteristics of each inmate who died. This includes personal 
data (i.e., name, date of birth, date of death, and sex), 
correctional information (i.e., length of stay, legal status, and 
criminal offense of the deceased), and the circumstances of the 
death (i.e., medical treatment before death, pre-existing 
conditions, and time and place of death incident).

The DCRP had a 100% response rate among 50 state departments of 
corrections and 99% among the approximately 2,800 jail jurisdictions. 
Item response rates were also generally close to 100%. However, BJS 
had some concerns about the collection of COD data in the DCRP. Due 
to changes in data collection agents in 2008, data quality follow-up 
was cut short, resulting in 21% of missing COD information for jail 
deaths that year, compared to 2% in 2007 and 2009. This data anomaly 
significantly compromised BJS’s ability to report death trends.


Although the DCRP has collected inmate COD data since 2000, the 
extent to which respondents accurately reported this information, 
especially in multiple-cause deaths, is unknown. Various 
correctional professionals may complete the DCRP records, 
including jail administrators and correctional medical and line 
staff, while only the treating physician, a forensic pathologist, 
coroner, or funeral director may complete and file death 
certificates in the United States. 

The DCRP did not collect information on the manner of death for 
suicides (e.g., hanging) until 2008 and for alcohol and drug 
intoxication (e.g., ethanol toxicity and heroin toxicity) until 
2009.

DCRP respondents are instructed to report the final COD (known as 
the immediate COD on the death certificate) as recorded by a 
medical examiner or through another official medical 
investigation. (See Collecting cause of death data in the DCRP 
and NDI textbox.) In comparison, U.S. death certificates capture 
“the chain of events--diseases, injuries, or complications--that 
directly caused the death” ranked in order from the immediate to 
underlying. Contributing causes, which did not result in the 
underlying cause, are also collected in the National Center for 
Health Statistics’ (NCHS) National Death Index (NDI).

COD is one of the items that require the highest level of data 
quality follow-up in the DCRP collection due to item nonresponse 
or invalid data. If an autopsy is requested--as it is for nearly 
all jail and most prison deaths--DCRP respondents must wait for 
the autopsy report and all associated toxicology and lab tests to 
be made available. In some cases, respondents cannot obtain COD 
information from the medical examiner and will submit a record 
that is missing the COD. Missing data require follow-up and can
delay the final death record for weeks or months.

To address these issues, BJS examined the NDI as an alternative 
means of capturing COD data. The NDI is a centralized database of 
death certificate information abstracted from state vital 
statistics offices. Through NDI searches, health and medical 
researchers can determine whether persons in their studies have 
died or establish COD for persons known to be deceased. The NDI 
is considered the most comprehensive and accurate collection
of death identification and COD information. Both the source 
(e.g., death certificates) and coverage are better than other 
mortality death files, such as the Social Security 
Administration’s Death Master File.***Footnote 1 Fillenbaum, G. 
G., Burchett, B. M., & Blazer, D. G. (2009). Identifying
a National Death Index match. American Journal of Epidemiology, 
170(4), 515-518***.

BJS had several objectives for this project: obtain the COD codes 
reported on death certificates, evaluate the quality of the 
matches, and assess the agreement in COD between the matched DCRP 
and NDI records.

This report summarizes the results of these analyses and provides 
recommendations for improving COD data by linking DCRP and NDI 
data.

*************************************
DCRP and NDI cause of death coding
*************************************

Both the DCRP and NDI use codes for COD from the 10th revision 
of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and 
Related Health Problems (ICD-10). However, the two collections 
differ in how they assign ICD-10 codes and identify the most 
important COD when multiple conditions are present. These 
differences play an important role in COD mismatch between the 
DCRP and NDI (table 1).

A nosologist (i.e., a clinical coder trained by the NCHS)
processes DCRP data based on the codes listed on DCRP death 
forms. The nosologist assigns a maximum of five codes to each 
DCRP death case. The NDI provides up to 20 ICD-10 codes for the 
various conditions a decedent had, with a maximum of 14 for this 
dataset. While the NDI assigns ICD-10 codes for all deaths, the 
DCRP assigns ICD-10 codes only to natural deaths, such as heart 
disease, cancer, and liver disease. DCRP respondents are instructed 
to check a box for AIDS-related deaths, but no additional COD 
information is captured for these deaths. Unnatural deaths, 
such as drug or alcohol intoxication, homicides, suicides, 
and accidents, are not assigned ICD codes in the DCRP.

The NDI uses the Automated Classification of Medical Entities
(ACME) program to identify the underlying COD, which is the 
international standard for automated selection of the underlying 
COD. Studies have shown little discrepancy (up to 7%) between 
underlying causes assigned by ACME and a professional nosologist, 
but ACME offers considerable savings both in cost and efficiency. 
***Footnote 2 Doody, M. M., Hayes, H. M., & Bilgrad, R. (2001). 
Comparability of National Death Index Plus and standard 
procedures for determining causes of death in epidemiologic 
studies. Annals of Epidemiology, 11(1), 46-50***.

The inputs to ACME are the multiple ICD codes assigned to each 
entity (e.g., disease condition, accident, or injury) listed
on death certificates, in a particular order as reported. ACME
then applies the World Health Organization rules to the ICD
codes and selects an underlying COD. Underlying COD is defined as 
“(a) the disease or injury which initiated the train of events 
leading directly to death, or (b) the circumstances of the 
accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.”***Footnote 
3 World Health Organization. (1975). Manual of the international
statistical classification of diseases, injuries, and causes of 
death: World Health Organization***.

The DCRP uses a different system for identifying the underlying 
COD. Specifically, respondents are instructed to report a final 
COD as determined by a medical examiner. Cases with a single COD 
are ranked by frequency separately for male and female decedents. 
When a death is caused by multiple illnesses, the most common 
sex-specific COD among those with only one COD is designated the 
underlying COD. For example, a male decedent with two 
conditions—liver disease and cancer—is counted as a cancer death 
because cancer is a more common COD than liver disease among men
who die from a single COD.

In the NDI, the underlying COD variable is assigned an
ICD-10 code. This variable is collapsed into broader COD
categories: first into a 113-category Level-2 COD variable and
then into an 11-category Level-1 COD variable. For instance,
ICD-10 codes E10 through E14 (i.e., insulin-dependent diabetes 
mellitus, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, malnutrition-
related diabetes mellitus, other specified diabetes mellitus, and 
unspecified diabetes mellitus) are grouped into diabetes  
mellitus, a Level-2 category. The Level-1 CODs include 11 major 
categories of death:

* heart disease

* AIDS-related

* cancer

* liver disease

* respiratory disease

* other illness

* suicide

* homicide

* drug and alcohol intoxication

* accident

* other.

Both Level-1 and Level-2 categories are standard classifications
of CODs that are used by epidemiologists to categorize CODs and 
by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the 
NCHS.

In the DCRP, the underlying COD is a categorical variable with
the same 11 groups as the Level-1 underlying COD in the NDI; the 
DCRP does not offer ICD-10 codes or detailed categories for the 
underlying COD. Because BJS publishes inmate death rates by major 
categories of COD annually, this study focuses on the 11-category 
underlying COD variable when comparing DCRP and NDI data. 
Comparisons of multiple causes using all available ICD-10 codes 
were also conducted.

********************
Matching procedure
********************

DCRP death records from 2007 through 2010 were sent to the NDI 
Plus service, which provides COD listings for each potential 
match. Subjects in the DCRP were considered known decedents by 
the NDI, meaning that the DCRP had established the fact of death. 
Known decedent searches result in a higher likelihood of true 
matches than searches for subjects with an unknown vital status.

The NDI prefers using Social Security numbers (SSNs) as
identifiers. Neither SSNs nor maiden names of female inmates
are collected by DCRP and could be linked with the NDI. The
match between DCRP and NDI records used the following variables: 
decedents’ birth and death dates, first and last names, sex, race 
or Hispanic origin, and state of residence.

The DCRP 2007–10 file contained 17,420 records. Analysis was 
limited to those records with complete information on birth and 
death dates and unique birth date and death date combinations. 
Some pairs of subjects with the same birth and death dates also 
matched on last name, sex, race or Hispanic origin, and state of 
residence, differing only in first name. It is likely that these 
were duplicate records, and the difference in the first names was 
due to the inmate’s use of an alias. The final study cohort 
contained 17,358 decedents (figure 1).

The search for 17,358 DCRP subjects in the NDI database resulted 
in 37,868 possible matches. Each possible match was assigned a 
probabilistic match score by the NDI system. The probabilistic 
score is calculated by summing the individual weights applied to 
each data element (e.g., decedents’ sex, race or Hispanic origin, 
date of birth, state of residence) used in the NDI match. The 
weights reflect the degree of agreement between the information 
on the submission record and the NDI record. *** Footnote 4 
National Center for Health Statistics. (2013). National Death 
Index user’s guide. Hyattsville, MD: U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention***. For subjects with multiple possible matches, the 
record with the highest probabilistic score was selected. This 
procedure reduced the total number of matches to 16,265 deaths, 
or one match per subject.

In addition to the probabilistic match score, NDI provides
two variables to assess the quality of potential matches: status
code and exact match indicator. Derived from the probabilistic
match score, the status code indicates whether an individual is 
either assumed to be alive (status code=0) or dead (status 
code=1). In this study, given that all DCRP subjects are known
to be dead, a status code of 0 means that the potential match
has a relatively low probability of being a true match. The
NDI assigns status codes conservatively to avoid incorrectly
assuming that a living person is dead. As a result, while most
of the potential matches assigned a status code of 1 were true
matches, a number of true matches were assigned a status code
of 0.

The exact match variable indicates that all match fields on the
user record agree exactly with the information in the NDI.
Exact match is a more conservative criterion than status code
and may misclassify more true matches (i.e., false negatives)
due to misspellings or nicknames (e.g., Robert compared to
Bob). Given that all subjects were known to be dead, a broad
definition of match was employed to avoid the risk of dropping
eligible deaths, and all 16,265 cases with NDI matches were
included in the analysis.

*********************
Quality of matching
*********************

Overall, the NDI had at least one record available for 94% of
the DCRP subjects. No matches were found for 1,093 DCRP records 
(table 2). Eighty-two percent of the records had a status code 
of 1 and 67% had an exact match.

The overall match rate (94%) was slightly lower than in other 
samples, such as Vietnam era veterans (97%) and refinery and
petrochemical workers (97%). *** Footnote 5 Boyle, C. A. & 
Decoufle, P. (1990). National sources of vital status
information: Extent of coverage and possible selectivity in 
reporting. American Journal of Epidemiology, 131(1), 160-168; and 
Acquavella, J. F., Donaleski, D., & Hanis, N. M. (1986). An 
analysis of mortality follow-up through the National Death Index 
for a cohort of refinery and petrochemical workers. American 
Journal of Indian Medicine, 9(2), 181-187***. However, in the 
absence of several important identifiers (e.g., SSN and maiden 
name for females), this was a decent match rate.

The match rate did not show much variation by facility type, 
decedent’s sex, race or Hispanic origin, age, or death year. Even 
when differences were statistically significant between groups 
(e.g., prison compared to jail deaths and male compared to female 
decedents), they amounted to about 2 to 4 percentage points.

********************************************
Comparing data coverage for cause of death
********************************************

About 2% of death records in 2007–10 were missing COD in the 
DCRP, compared to 6% in the NDI (table 3). COD data may be 
missing in the NDI for a DCRP record for two reasons: (1) no 
matched record was found in the NDI, or (2) a matched record was 
found but the NDI had no COD information for it. In this 
comparison, all missing COD in the NDI was due to unmatched 
records. All matched records had COD data in the NDI. Out of the 
336 cases with missing COD in the DCRP, COD data was available 
for 302 cases by linking with the NDI, leaving 34 cases with no 
COD information (not shown).

The rate of missing data was higher for jail deaths than prison 
deaths, particularly in the DCRP (6% missing in jail compared to 
1% in prison). This was due to a data anomaly in 2008, when 21% 
of the DCRP jail deaths (n=202) were missing COD information. 
***Footnote 6 Excluding 2008, 1% of jail deaths were missing 
COD***. By linking to the NDI database, COD information was 
obtained for 185 out of those 202 cases, providing a resolution 
for 92% of the cases (not shown).

The NDI provided more ICD-10 codes than the DCRP. On average, 
each subject received 1.06 ICD codes in the DCRP (including 
unmatched cases), while each matched record received an average 
of 2.69 codes in the NDI (table 4). This large difference 
occurred in part because the DCRP asks respondents for final 
cause of death, and the cause of death question on the U.S. 
standard certificate of death requests multiple causes. In 
addition, ICD-10 codes were not assigned to unnatural deaths in 
the DCRP.

Prison deaths were assigned more ICD codes than jail deaths both 
in the DCRP (1.17 for prison deaths compared to 0.68 for jail 
deaths) and in the NDI (2.74 for prison deaths compared to 2.54 
for jail deaths). Large differences also existed by COD category. 
The DCRP did not assign ICD codes for unnatural deaths, such as 
suicides, homicides, intoxications, and accidents. In the NDI, 
deaths from unnatural causes received more ICD codes than deaths 
from illness.

*************************************
Comparing underlying cause of death
*************************************

In this report, DCRP and NDI data are compared to determine the 
accuracy and completeness of CODs reported by DCRP respondents. 
COD data were compared in three ways. The distributions of 
underlying COD in the two datasets were compared at the aggregate 
level. Also, the correspondence of underlying COD between the two 
datasets was examined at the individual level, and the reasons 
for mismatch were explored. The first two analyses used the major 
category of death, which classified COD into 11 groups. Finally, 
the analysis compared the correspondence of multiple causes 
between the two datasets at the individual level, using all
available ICD-10 codes. This analysis helped explain the mismatch 
of the underlying COD in the two datasets.

The marginal distributions of the underlying COD from the two 
datasets were similar. The leading CODs in the DCRP were heart 
disease (25%), cancer (22%), and suicide (11%), while those in 
the NDI were cancer (23%), heart disease (22%), and suicide (11%) 
(table 5). Illness, or natural, deaths were far more prevalent 
among prisoners (89% of prison deaths in the DCRP and the NDI) 
than among jail inmates (55% of jail deaths in the DCRP and 59% 
in the NDI). About 30% of jail deaths were due to suicide, 
compared to 6% of prison deaths.

The leading CODs were the same for male and female inmates
(i.e., heart disease, cancer, and suicide) with small  
differences: Cancer and heart disease accounted for higher 
percentages of male deaths than female deaths, while suicide 
accounted for a higher percentage of female deaths than male 
deaths. ***Footnote 7 Although suicides accounted for a larger 
percentage of female inmate deaths, males accounted for the 
majority (91% in jail and 95% in prison) of suicides in 
correctional facilities. See Mortality in Local Jails and State
Prisons, 2000–2013 - Statistical Tables (NCJ 248756, BJS web, 
August 2015). These patterns were evident in both the DCRP and 
the NDI. 

To examine how COD data in the NDI correspond to data in the DCRP 
at the individual level, the DCRP underlying COD was cross-
tabulated by the NDI underlying COD for 15,963 respondents with 
known COD in both datasets. This reveals how frequently the COD 
categorization of NDI agreed with that of DCRP (table 6 and table 
7).

Two statistics are used to measure the congruence of DCRP and NDI 
COD data (i.e., intercoder reliability): the agreement rate and 
the kappa statistic. The agreement rate is the percentage of 
records classified into the same category by the two datasets. 
The kappa statistic was first proposed by Cohen. ***Footnote 8 
Cohen, J. (1960). A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales.
Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, 37-46***. It 
measures intercoder reliability while taking into account 
agreement that is expected purely by chance--that is, it 
indicates the level of agreement achieved beyond chance. When the 
raters (i.e., the DCRP and NDI) are in complete agreement, kappa 
takes on the value of 1. Landis and Koch suggested characterizing 
values less than 0 as indicating no agreement, 0 to 0.20 as 
slight, 0.21 to 0.40 as fair, 0.41 to 0.60 as moderate, 0.61 to 
0.80 as substantial, and 0.81 to 1 as almost perfect agreement. 
***Footnote 9 Landis, J. R. & Koch, G. G. (1977). The 
measurement of observer agreement for categorical data. 
Biometrics, 33(1), 159-174***. (See Methodology for more detail.)

The overall agreement rate was 70%, meaning that 70% of the 
deaths were classified into the same major category of death by 
the DCRP and the NDI. The kappa statistic was 0.64, which 
indicates a substantial level of agreement following Landis and 
Koch’s guidelines. The percentage of records that received 
identical classification in both collections varied by COD 
category, ranging from less than 40% to more than 90%. The 
categories in the DCRP with the highest agreement rates were 
suicide (93%), cancer (87%), homicide (86%), and AIDS-related 
(79%). In the DCRP, deaths due to liver disease (38%) and 
respiratory disease (48%) had the lowest agreement rates. This 
low agreement rate was likely due to how DCRP respondents 
recorded these deaths. For example, a death due to hepatitis (an 
inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis virus) would be 
recorded accurately as an infectious disease by the NDI, but may 
have been recorded as a liver-related death by the DCRP. 
Similarly, respiratory deaths are frequently coupled with other 
conditions and diseases (such as AIDS, cancer, or heart disease), 
and it is likely that DCRP respondents listed the causes that 
they deemed more serious than others.

The NDI attributed 18% of the 3,917 DCRP deaths due to heart 
disease (n=722) to some undefined illness categories, 4% to 
respiratory disease (n=148), and 4% to cancer (n=146). In total, 
the NDI attributed 3,553 deaths to heart disease, 9% less than 
the DCRP. The NDI also attributed 14% of DCRP homicides to other 
causes. Specifically, 9% were classified as natural deaths in the 
NDI—heart disease (3%), cancer (2%), respiratory or other illness 
(4%)—and the remainder were classified as accidental or other.

Close to half (49%) of deaths due to liver disease in the DCRP
were attributed to other illness in the NDI. This included 
liver-related deaths caused by the hepatitis virus because of
its infectious nature. The NDI also attributed 11% of DCRP
deaths from respiratory disease to heart disease, 9% to cancer,
and 23% to other illness.

When the NDI classified a record differently from the DCRP, it 
tended to place it in the same broad category of COD as in the 
DCRP (either illness or unnatural death). In total, 68% of the 
illness deaths in the DCRP were classified into the same major 
category of death in the NDI (table 8). Thirty percent of the 
illness deaths were attributed to a different illness category,
while only 2% were reported as unnatural deaths. Eighty-six
percent of the unnatural deaths in the DCRP received the same
classification in the NDI, 8% were attributed to illness deaths,
and 4% to other causes.

****************************************************************
Assessing the sources of disagreement between the DCRP and NDI
****************************************************************

Differences in the COD classification between the DCRP and NDI 
are due to several factors. Mismatched records are the first 
factor to consider. Two records may not be true matches even if 
they have the same identifiers, such as last name and birth and 
death dates. It is not possible to accurately distinguish true 
matches from false matches, but the NDI status code can be used 
as a proxy. As previously discussed, the NDI matching process 
assigned a status code of 1—indicating a high probabilistic 
score--to 82% of the matches, and a code of 0--indicating a low 
probabilistic score--to 18% of matches. The congruence in 
underlying COD between the DCRP and NDI should be higher for 
matches with a status code of 1 than for those with a status code 
of 0.

The second factor is data source. The information on the death 
certificate may be different from that on the medical examiner’s 
report, or the text may be the same, but the case was assigned 
different ICD-10 codes by NDI and DCRP nosologists. This 
explanation was examined by directly comparing the sets of ICD 
codes from the DCRP and NDI for matched records.

The two datasets use different methods to identify the underlying 
COD when decedents have multiple health conditions. Specifically, 
the NDI uses ACME to identify the underlying COD from the list of 
ICD-coded conditions. When using ACME, shuffling the order in 
which the codes are listed can change the underlying COD. The 
DCRP instructs respondents to report a final COD as determined by 
a medical examiner. For multiple-cause deaths in the DCRP, the 
most common cause is designated as the underlying COD. Due to 
such procedural differences, even records with an identical
set of ICD-10 codes may be assigned to different underlying
COD categories in the two datasets. To understand how much this 
factor affects the congruence of the underlying COD between the 
DCRP and NDI, agreement rates were calculated separately for 
records with an identical set of ICD codes in the two datasets 
and those with different ICD codes. Agreement rates were also 
calculated by the number of ICD codes. The agreement rates should 
be higher for records with an identical set of ICD codes and for 
those with fewer ICD codes.

The congruence of the underlying COD between the DCRP and the NDI 
was compared by status code and other factors (table 9). The 
kappa statistic of 0.46 and the overall agreement rate of 56% for 
records with a status code of 0 (i.e., matches with lower 
probabilistic match scores) were significantly lower than the 
kappa statistic of 0.66 and 72% for the corresponding statistics 
for those with a status code of 1 (i.e., those with higher 
probabilistic match scores). Except for accidental and other or 
unknown COD, deaths in each COD category by DCRP had a higher 
agreement rate for matches with a status code of 1 than for 
matches with a status code of 0. For example, 83% of the AIDS-
related deaths in the DCRP with a status code of 1 were also 
classified as AIDS-related deaths in the NDI, compared to 57% of 
those with a status code of 0.

The agreement rates were also compared by the number of 
conditions (i.e., single-cause compared to multiple-cause 
deaths), facility type, sex, and death year. In this context,
single-cause deaths were those that had only one ICD-10 code in 
both datasets, and multiple-cause deaths had more than one ICD-10 
code in either the NDI or DCRP. Because no ambiguity was involved 
in identifying the underlying COD for single-cause deaths, 
single-cause deaths had higher intercoder reliability, with a 
kappa statistic of 0.77 and an overall agreement rate of 83%, 
compared to a kappa statistic of 0.52 and an overall agreement 
rate of 63% for multiple-cause illness deaths. The difference in 
agreement rates was also substantial within each illness 
category. For example, 73% of deaths attributed only to 
respiratory disease in the DCRP were also categorized as 
respiratory disease in the NDI, compared to 42% of the deaths 
attributed to respiratory disease in the DCRP that also had other 
causes. Because the DCRP did not assign ICD-10 codes to unnatural 
deaths, this analysis was restricted to DCRP illness deaths only.

Jail deaths had better agreement than prison deaths, with a kappa 
statistic of 0.68 (compared to 0.61 for prison deaths) and an 
overall agreement rate of 74% (compared to 69%). This was likely 
because nearly all jail deaths in the study group were sent for 
autopsy (95%), while about two-thirds (65%) of prisoner deaths 
were autopsied.

DCRP–NDI agreement improved over time. Within 4 years, the kappa 
statistic increased from 0.60 in 2007 to 0.68 in 2010 and the 
overall agreement rate increased from 67% in 2007 to 74% in 2010.

To further explore how DCRP–NDI agreement varies by decedent 
demographics and circumstances of death, a logistic regression 
was run with the 15,293 death records with COD information in 
both datasets. The dependent variable is binary, with 1 
indicating that the record received the same COD classification 
in the DCRP and the NDI, and 0 indicating otherwise. The 
independent variables include facility type, sex, race or 
Hispanic origin, age group of the deceased, year of death, DCRP 
COD category, match quality (or NDI’s status code), and the 
number of conditions (i.e., single compared to multiple).

The regression results confirm the relationships observed in the 
previous analysis (table 10). Records with a status code of 1 
were more likely to receive the same categorization for 
underlying COD in both datasets than those with a status code of 
0, with an odds ratio of 2.2. This effect was statistically 
significant. Likewise, single-cause deaths were more likely to be 
consistently classified than multiple-cause deaths, with an odds 
ratio of 2.05.

Intercoder reliability also varied across COD categories. Deaths 
due to suicide, homicide, cancer, and AIDS-related problems had 
higher agreement rates than deaths by heart disease, while liver 
disease, respiratory disease, and drug and alcohol intoxication 
had lower agreement rates. Furthermore, deaths that occurred in 
jail had higher agreement rates than deaths that occurred in 
prison, with an odds ratio of 1.21. The sex of the decedent made 
no difference on agreement rate. Deaths of black decedents had 
lower agreement rates than those of white decedents, with an odds 
ratio of 0.91. There were no statistical differences among 
Hispanics, whites, and persons of other races. Lastly, the 
agreement rates in 2009 and 2010 were significantly higher than 
in 2007.

To further understand the source of mismatch between the
underlying COD, detailed ICD-10 codes from the DCRP and the NDI 
were analyzed for matched records. This analysis was limited to 
12,131 records with ICD codes from both records. Thirty percent 
of the cases were excluded either because they were classified as 
unnatural deaths, and therefore not assigned ICD-10 codes in the 
DCRP, or because no matches were found in the NDI. The 12,131 
records were classified into 5 groups based on the relationship 
of their ICD codes reported in the DCRP and NDI (table 11).

Twenty percent of the cases (2,402) received the same set of
ICD codes in the DCRP and NDI. In 3,371 cases (28%), the DCRP ICD 
codes were a subset of the NDI codes. That is, all DCRP codes 
were also reported on the matching NDI record, but the latter 
also had one or more codes not reported in the DCRP. The NDI 
codes were a subset of the DCRP codes in 342 cases (3%). Because 
the DCRP provides up to 5 ICD codes for each illness death, while 
the NDI provides up to 14 codes for each death in this dataset, 
it is more likely that the COD codes assigned by the DCRP were a 
subset of those assigned by the NDI than the reverse. In 1,129 
cases (9%), the ICD-10 codes from the two datasets were different 
with some overlap. In 4,887 cases (40%), the ICD-10 codes from 
the two datasets were different with no overlap. The proportions 
of the last two groups indicate substantial mismatch in the all-
cause ICD codes between the two datasets. 

Ninety-four percent of records with the same set of ICD-10 codes 
in the DCRP and the NDI were assigned to the same major category 
of death by the two datasets in the categorization of the 
underlying COD (table 12). The agreement rate was 78% for records 
with DCRP codes being a subset of NDI codes, and 72% for records 
with NDI codes being a subset of DCRP codes. The agreement rate 
was lower for records with different sets of ICD codes with 
overlap (62%) and without overlap (52%).

Six percent of the cases with identical ICD-10 codes in the DCRP 
and the NDI ended up in different major categories of underlying 
COD. This could be due to the order in which the ICD-10 codes 
were entered into the system, as order can affect the final COD 
determination in ACME. For cases with a single identical ICD-10 
code in both datasets, the agreement rate was almost 100%. As the 
number of ICD-10 codes increased to 5, the agreement rate dropped 
to 57%. The same pattern was observed for groups B and C. As the 
number of ICD-10 codes in the DCRP increased, the agreement rate 
dropped from 79% to 58% for group B, and from 84% to 57% for 
group C. For groups D and E, where DCRP and NDI codes were 
different with or without overlapping, the agreement rate was 
relatively low, regardless of the number of ICD-10 codes in the 
DCRP.

These results confirm that disagreement in the underlying COD 
between the DCRP and the NDI was due partly to differences in the 
source data and partly to the different procedures for 
identifying the underlying COD. Forty percent of the cases 
received completely different ICD codes in the DCRP and the NDI. 
This group had a much lower agreement rate in underlying COD than 
records that received identical or similar ICD codes in the two 
datasets. Even among records that received the same ICD codes, 
the agreement rate declined as the number of conditions 
increased, suggesting that the different procedures for 
identifying the underlying COD in the two datasets can lead to 
different classifications of major categories of deaths.

**************************
Summary and implications
**************************

This study evaluated the feasibility of linking the DCRP data to 
the NDI database and assessed whether the DCRP was accurately 
capturing and measuring COD, whether the NDI could provide COD 
for DCRP cases missing this data, and whether the NDI could 
provide additional detail to illness deaths. Matches were found 
for 94% of the death records sent to the NDI, and 82% of the 
matches were considered a true match by the NDI matching program. 
Notably, the percentage of cases that were unable to be matched 
declined over time, from 7.3% in 2007 to 5.8% in 2010. To further 
improve the matching effectiveness of NDI search, BJS may 
consider the following:

* Create and use a unique subject ID variable for DCRP records 
sent to the NDI. A subject ID would allow the study to include 
persons who share the same last name, date of birth, and date of 
death as unique individuals with shared traits. Without the 
identifier, the distinction between unique persons and potential 
duplicate records could not be made, and these cases were 
excluded.

* Send multiple records with all known aliases to the NDI to 
improve matching. All aliases for one individual should be 
identified by the same subject ID. This would be applicable if 
the data providers included information about aliases by which an 
inmate is known (e.g., Sammy or Sam). If more than one match was 
returned, the match with the highest probabilistic score could 
then be used as the true match.

* Use decedents’ SSNs in matching. The DCRP does not collect 
SSNs; however, BJS may be able to obtain them for decedents by 
matching DCRP records to other BJS administrative databases that 
include them.

The NDI linkage provides reliable, accurate, and comprehensive 
information of COD on jail and prison inmates. NDI data are based 
on death certificates and processed with standard National Center 
for Health Statistics (NCHS) codes. The NDI uses a reproducible 
automated algorithm (i.e., ACME) to identify the underlying COD. 
It allows comparisons with national data on noninstitutionalized
populations because the same algorithms are used for ranking COD, 
determining underlying COD, and rolling up the CODs into broad 
categories of death. These algorithms are stable over time and 
systematic, and they are easily understood by public health and 
medical audiences.

The NDI provided more than twice as many ICD-10 codes per subject 
than did the DCRP (2.69 for the NDI compared to 1.06 for the 
DCRP). This was likely a result of the way CODs were recorded in 
death certificates. BJS may consider adopting the version found 
in standard death certificates. 

With more accurate and comprehensive COD data from the NDI, BJS 
may produce statistics on specific diseases in correctional 
populations. Prison administrators and correctional health 
professionals may use detailed NDI trend data to plan and budget 
for treating chronic health conditions among long-term inmates. 
For example, hepatitis C has received a lot of attention in 
correctional health circles recently, in part because new 
pharmacotherapy to treat hepatitis C is expensive and the older 
standard course of treatment is complicated and hard to implement 
among inmates.*** Footnote 10 Keller, J. E. (2014). Hepatitis C 
treatment: Between a rock and a hard place. Correct Care, 28(2), 
8-9, 20. http://www.ncchc.org/ filebin/CorrectCare/28-2.pdf; and 
Mortality in Local Jails and State Prisons, 2000–2013 - 
Statistical Tables, NCJ 248756, BJS web, August 2015***. National 
statistics could be used by administrators and health care 
professionals to justify the funding and resources needed to 
mitigate the high rates of hepatitis C found in some facilities.

NDI search is a viable solution if BJS wants to reduce missing 
COD data or improve data quality. NDI search provided COD 
information for 90% of the cases with missing data in the DCRP. 
It takes approximately 12 months after the end of the calendar 
year for deaths to be included in the NDI database, which is 3 
months longer than the DCRP. However, relying exclusively on the 
NDI for COD is not recommended because a subset of DCRP cases (6% 
in 2007–10) cannot be matched with NDI data, and some matches may 
not be correct.

At the individual level, 70% of the records were classified into 
the same major category of death by the two datasets. The 
discrepancies were due to several factors: (1) the matched 
records may not be true matches, (2) most cases were not assigned 
the same set of ICD-10 codes by the two datasets, and (3) the 
process for identifying the underlying COD from multiple ICD 
codes was different between the two datasets such that even 
records with identical ICD codes may be classified to different 
major categories of death. Deaths with more ICD-10 codes were 
less likely to be categorized as the same underlying COD in the 
two datasets.

BJS publishes annual statistical tables on the distribution of
COD over 11 major categories. When detailed NDI data were rolled 
into the same categories, the overall distributions from the two 
datasets were similar. In other words, the current DCRP method 
for obtaining COD produces aggregate statistics that are roughly 
comparable to what may be produced using NDI data.

Overall, the NDI linkage provides significant improvement in the 
quality of COD data in the DCRP. BJS will report COD statistics 
with increased confidence when DCRP COD data align with NDI data.

Methodology
*************

Data source: Deaths in Custody Reporting Program
*************************************************

The Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP) is an annual 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) data collection. The DCRP 
collects national, state, and incident-level data on persons who 
died while in the physical custody of the 50 state departments of 
corrections or the approximately 2,800 local adult jail 
jurisdictions nationwide. The DCRP began in 2000 under the Death 
in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-297), and it is the 
only national statistical collection to obtain comprehensive 
information about deaths in adult correctional facilities. BJS 
uses DCRP data to track national trends in the number and causes 
(or manners) of deaths occurring in state prison or local jail 
custody.

The DCRP collects data about the characteristics of the decedents 
as well as circumstances surrounding the death, including the 
cause, time and location where the death occurred, and  
information on whether an autopsy was conducted and the
availability of results to the respondent. Data on executions are
excluded from this report but are accessible on the BJS website
along with the DCRP mortality data. 

The DCRP data collection instruments are administered annually to 
both state prisons and local jails. In addition to individual 
death records, respondents provide an aggregate count of the 
number of deaths that occurred during the referenced calendar 
year. 

BJS obtains a separate report describing the decedent’s
characteristics and the circumstances surrounding the death
for each death that occurred in a state prison or local jail. 
State prison and local jail respondents can submit individual 
records on decedents at any time during a collection cycle 
through a BJS web-based collection system.

Data source: The National Death Index
***************************************

The National Death Index (NDI) is a centralized database of death 
certificates filed by state vital statistics offices. The NDI was 
established by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) 
established the NDI as a mortality register for epidemiologists 
and other professional medical investigators and death 
researchers. Like the DCRP, the NDI is available for statistical 
purposes only, which precludes its use for legal, administrative, 
private or genological purposes.

The NDI is considered the “gold standard” for death 
identification because both the source, i.e., death certificates,
and coverage is better than other mortality death files, such as
the Social Security Administration’s Death Master File.

(2009). Identifying a National Death Index Match. American 
Journal of Epidemiology, 170(4), 515–518***.

Nonresponse
*************

All state department of corrections and more than 99% of jails 
participated for data years 2007 through 2010. However, there is 
varying degree of item nonresponse, particularly for the cause of 
death item. BJS changed data collection agents in 2009. As a 
result, the follow-up period for data year 2008 was cut short, 
and 21% of jail deaths and 3% of prison deaths were missing cause 
of death information. Aside from data year 2008, missingness 
affects a small percentage of cases--less than 1% of prison and 
3% of jail deaths--annually.

Reported statistics
*********************

The kappa statistic was first proposed by Cohen. ***Footnote 12 
Cohen, J. (1960). A coefficient of agreement for nominal scales.
Educational and Psychological Measurement, 20, 37–46***. It 
measures intercoder reliability while taking into account 
agreement that is expected purely by chance—that is, it indicates 
the level of agreement achieved beyond chance. For reliability 
between two raters (i.e., the DCRP and NDI), kappa is calculated 
as (po – pe) / (1 – pe), where po is the observed proportionate 
agreement among raters and pe is the expected proportionate 
agreement by chance. When the raters are in complete agreement, 
kappa is 1. Landis and Koch suggested characterizing values less 
than 0 as indicating no agreement, 0 to 0.20 as slight, 0.21 to 
0.40 as fair, 0.41 to 0.60 as moderate, 0.61 to 0.80 as 
substantial, and 0.81 to 1 as almost perfect agreement.***
