HIGHLIGHTS

* As of June 30, 1993, sheriffs' departments in
the United States had an estimated 224,236
full-time employees, 10% more than in 1990.  This
total included 155,815 sworn personnel and 68,421
civilian employees.

* Nearly all sheriffs' departments were
responsible for performing court-related functions
such as serving civil process (97%) and providing
court security (93%).  About 9 in 10 investigated
crimes (92%), responded to calls for service
(91%), and provided routine patrol services (88%).

* Many sheriffs' departments also had primary
responsibility for dispatching calls for service
(80%), operating a jail (79%), drug enforcement
(78%), traffic enforcement (77%), and search and
rescue operations (65%).  (See following page for
comparisons of sheriffs' departments with local
police.)

* For fiscal 1993, sheriffs' departments had
operating expenditures of $10.7 billion. This was
6% more than 1990 after adjusting for inflation. 
Operating expenditures averaged $66,500 per sworn
officer, $45,900 per employee, and $45 per
resident for 1993.

* Overall, 16.9% of  the full-time sworn personnel
employed by sheriffs' departments in 1993 were
members of a racial or ethnic minority.  This was
an increase compared to 1990 (15.5%) and 1987
(13.4%).  Blacks accounted for 10% of sworn
personnel in 1993, and Hispanics comprised about
6%. 

* In 1993, 8% of sheriffs' departments required
new deputy recruits to have completed at least
some college course work, compared to about 4% in
1990.  Less than 1% of all departments required a
4-year degree; however, 5% required a 2-year
degree.

* New deputy recruits were required to undergo an
average of about 750 hours of  training in 1993. 
The average requirement ranged from about 900
hours among departments serving a population of 1
million or more, to about 450 hours in those 
serving fewer than 10,000 residents.   

* Eighty-two percent of sheriffs' departments
authorized their regular field officers to use
semiautomatic sidearms in 1993, up from 74% in
1990.  Departments authorizing semiautomatic
sidearms employed 91% of all sheriffs' officers in
1993, compared to 83% in 1990.

* Nearly all (97%) sheriffs' departments
authorized the use of nonlethal weapons by
officers.  Impact devices such as batons were
authorized by 85% of all departments.  Chemical
agents were authorized by 77%, with pepper spray
(56%) the type most commonly approved.

* Thirty percent of sheriffs' departments required
all of their regular field officers to wear
protective body armor while on duty during 1993,
up from 21% in 1990.  Departments with such a
requirement employed 35% of all sheriffs' officers
in 1993, compared to 23% in 1990.

* Sixty-five percent of sheriffs' departments
participated in a 911 emergency telephone system
during 1993, a considerably higher percentage than
in 1990 (42%) and more than twice as many as in
1987 (28%).

* A majority of the 911 systems that sheriffs'
departments participated in during 1993 were
enhanced systems, capable of pinpointing the
source of a call automatically.  Overall, 36% of
sheriffs' departments had an enhanced system in
1993, compared to 11% in 1990 and 8% in 1987.

* An estimated 62% of sheriffs' departments were
maintaining computerized files on warrants in
1993, up from 47% in 1990.  A majority of
departments (58%) also maintained computerized
arrest information during 1993, compared to 42% in
1990.

Functions of sheriffs' and police 
departments and their officers 

Among the 156,000 full-time sworn personnel
employed by sheriffs' departments in 1993, about
60,000 were uniformed officers whose regularly
assigned duties included responding to calls for
service. This amounted to 39% of sheriffs'
department sworn personnel handling calls for
service, compared to 63% of officers in local
police departments. This difference is
attributable to the fact that, relative to local
police,  sheriffs' departments are much more
likely to be responsible for activities related to
jail and court operations.  More often than not,
these responsibilities are in addition to
traditional law enforcement duties.

A large majority of both sheriffs' and local
police  departments receive calls for service,
investigate crimes, and provide routine patrol
services

SHERIFFS' DEPARTMENTS 1993

During 1993, the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS), as a part of its Law Enforcement Management
and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) program,
surveyed a nationally representative sample of the
more than 17,000 State and local law enforcement
agencies operating nationwide.  This report
presents data describing the more than 3,000
sheriffs' departments operating in the United
States in terms of their personnel, expenditures
and pay, operations, equipment, computers and
information systems, and policies.

The sheriffs' departments included in this report
are operated by county or independent city
governments.  Since sheriffs are typically elected
officials, these agencies are sometimes known as
sheriff's offices, but the term departments is
used universally in this report as a matter of
convenience.  Consolidated police-sheriffs'
departments are classified as local police for the
LEMAS survey and are excluded from this report.

The LEMAS survey
----------------

The 1993 LEMAS survey questionnaire was mailed to
all 854 State and local law enforcement agencies
with 100 or more sworn officers and to a
representative sample of 2,416 agencies with fewer
than 100 officers (see Methodology for a
description of the sample).  Of the 3,270 agencies
receiving the LEMAS questionnaire, 3,028 (92.6%)
responded.

Detailed agency-by-agency tabulations from the
1993 LEMAS survey were previously published for
agencies with 100 or more officers (see Law 
Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics, 1993, NCJ-148825).  This report and
its companion report (Local Police Departments
1993, NCJ-148822), summarize the data collected
from agencies of all sizes. 

This is the third LEMAS survey.  Data from the
previous surveys in 1987 and 1990 are used for
comparison purposes in this report.  Law
enforcement manpower data collected by BJS in
1992 are less comprehensive in content (they
include only personnel counts) and therefore are
not used for comparisons.

Personnel
---------

During 1993 an estimated 17,120 publicly funded
State and local law enforcement agencies were
operating in the United States (table 1).

Note:  Special police category includes both State-level and local-level agencies.  
Consolidated police-sheriff agencies are included under local police category.
Data are for the pay period that included June 30, 1993.

Excluding a small number of consolidated
police-sheriff agencies, there were 3,084
sheriffs' departments, all operated by counties
and independent cities.  


As of June 30, 1993, sheriffs' departments had an
estimated 224,236 full-time employees.  They
employed an additional 19,660 persons on a
part-time basis.  About 156,000, or 69%, of
full-time sheriffs' department employees were
sworn officers.  This represented a fourth of all
State and local officers nationwide.  The
estimated 68,421 civilian sheriffs' department
personnel in 1993 accounted for a third of all
nonsworn State and local law enforcement employees
in the United States.

There were about 20,000, or 9.9%, more full-time
employees in sheriffs' departments in 1993 than in
1990, and about 47,000, or 26.6%, more than in
1987 (figure 1).  For all State and local law
enforcement agencies, the increase in number of
employees from 1990 to 1993 was about 35,000, or
4.5%, and from 1987 to 1993 it was about 79,000,
or 10.5%. 

When only sworn personnel are considered,
employment by sheriffs' departments increased by
about 14,000 officers, or 10.2%, from 1990 to 1993
and by about 33,000, or 27.2%, from 1987 to 1993. 
The number of full-time sworn personnel employed
by all State and local law enforcement agencies in
1993 was up by about 27,000, or 4.5%, compared to
1990, and by about 55,000, or 9.7%, compared to
1987.   

As with local police departments, the size of
sheriffs' departments varies greatly.  The Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department was the
largest in 1993, with 11,285 full-time employees. 
Included in this total were 7,629 full-time sworn
officers, of which about 3,400 were assigned to
field operations. 

Nationwide, there were 17 sheriffs' departments
that employed 1,000 or more sworn officers (0.6%),
and more than 300 that employed at least 100
officers (10.3%) (table 2).

-- Less than 0.5%.

Nearly 1,000 sheriffs' departments employed fewer than 10
officers (31.2%), including 19 with just one sworn
officer (0.6%). 


About a fifth of all full-time sheriffs' officers
were employed by a department with 1,000 or more
officers, and two-thirds were employed by a
department with at least 100 officers. Sheriffs'
departments that employed fewer than 10 officers
accounted for about 3% of all sheriffs' department
sworn personnel nationwide. 

About half of all sheriffs' department officers
worked for the 184 departments located in a
jurisdiction with 250,000 or more residents and a
fifth were employed by 1 of the 25 departments
serving a population of 1 million or more (table
3).  Just over half of all sheriffs' departments
were located in a jurisdiction with fewer than
25,000 residents.  These departments employed
about 11% of all sworn sheriffs' department
personnel nationwide.

On the average, sheriffs' departments nationwide
had 73 full-time employees including 51 sworn
personnel and 22 civilian employees (table 4). The
size of departments varied greatly depending on
the jurisdiction population:  Sheriffs'
departments in jurisdictions with a population of
1 million or more had an average of 1,936
full-time employees, including 1,233 sworn
officers and 703 civilian employees.  In contrast,
sheriffs' departments in jurisdictions with fewer
than 10,000 residents employed an average of 6
full-time sworn officers, and 3 full-time
civilians.

Race and sex of officers

Of the estimated 155,518 full-time sworn personnel
employed by sheriffs' departments in 1993, an
estimated 22,657, or 1 in 7, were women (table 5). 
The percentage of female officers varied slightly
across population sizes, ranging from about 16% in
jurisdictions with a population of 100,000 to
999,999 to just under 12% in jurisdictions with a
population of 10,000 to 49,999.

Compared to 1990, the number of female officers
was up by less than a thousand, and the percentage
of all sheriffs' officers represented by women was
down slightly from 15.4% to 14.6% (figure 2). 
However, there were about 7,200 more female
officers in 1993 than in 1987, when 12.6% 
of sheriffs' officers were women. 

In 1993, about a sixth of full-time sheriffs'
officers were members of a racial or ethnic
minority, with the percentage of minority officers
higher in jurisdictions with a population of
500,000 or more (table 6).  Overall, the number of
sheriffs' officers who were members of a racial or
ethnic minority in 1993 (26,367) was about 20%
greater than in 1990 (21,290) and about 61%
greater than in 1987 (16,420).

Blacks accounted for 10% of all sheriffs' officers
in 1993, with departments serving a population of
500,000 to 999,999 employing the highest
percentage of black officers (14.1%).  About 6% of
sheriffs' officers nationwide were Hispanic, with
departments serving a population of 1 million or
more having the most Hispanic officers (13.3%).

The estimated 15,621 full-time black officers
employed in 1993 represented an increase of 1,762
compared to 1990 and 5,450 compared to 1987.  The
percentage of black officers in 1993 (10.0%) was
about the same as in 1990 (9.8%), but up
significantly from 1987, when 8.3% of all
sheriffs' officers were black.

There were an estimated 8,979 Hispanic officers
employed by sheriffs' departments in 1993.  This
was 35% more than in 1990 (6,647) and 70% more
than in 1987 (5,269).  The percentage of sheriffs'
officers represented by Hispanics in 1993 (5.8%)
represented an increase over 1990 (4.7%) and 1987
(4.3%) levels.  

Education and training requirements
for new officers

Nearly all (97%) sheriffs' departments had a
formal education requirement for new officer
recruits in 1993 (table 7).  The typical minimum
educational requirement was completion of
highschool (89%).  About 8% of departments, twice
as many as in 1990, required at least some college
course work of new deputy recruits.  Although less
than 1% of sheriffs' departments required new
deputy recruits to have a 4-year college degree,
5% did require a 2-year degree.  Overall, 99% of
sheriffs' officers nationwide were employed by a
department that required new deputies to have at
least a high school diploma, including 7% who were
employed by a department that required them to
have at least some college.

--Less than 0.5%.


An estimated 90% of all sheriffs' departments,
employing 97% of all officers, required new deputy
recruits tocomplete formal training (table 8). 
All of the departments serving a population of
500,000 or more and more than 90% of those serving
a population of 25,000 to 499,999 required
training.  The percentage of departments in
smaller jurisdictions that required training was
slightly lower--86% in jurisdictions with a
population of 10,000 to 24,999, and 83% in
jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000 residents.

Note:  Computation of average number of training
hours required excludes departments not requiring
training.

On average, sheriffs' departments required 565
training hours of new deputy recruits, with about
two-thirds of the training in the classroom.
Sheriffs' departments in jurisdictions with 1
million or more residents (901 hours), required
about twice as many training hours of new recruits
as those serving a population of less than 10,000
(451 hours).  

Classroom training requirements were most
stringent among departments serving a population
of 1 million or more (an average of 615 hours),
while departments serving a population of 250,000
to 999,999 (about 330 hours) required the most
field training hours on average.  

When sheriffs' departments are weighted according
to number of officers, it is estimated that the
average new deputy recruit in 1993 was required to
undergo 748 hours of training, with 478 hours, or
64%, of it in the classroom.

Compared to 1990, the average number of training
hours required of new deputy recruits in 1993 was
up significantly in most sheriffs' departments
(figure 3).  Departments serving a population of
less than 25,000 required an average of 416 hours
of training in 1993, compared to 346 in 1990. 
Among departments serving a population of 25,000 
to 99,000, the average training requirement was up
by more than 100 hours, from 474 hours in 1990 to
579 hours in 1993. Departments serving a
population of 100,000 to 499,999 increased their
average requirement by nearly 100 hours, from 553
hours to 646 hours.  Among departments serving
500,000 or more residents, training requirements
for new recruits remained about the same,
averaging just under 800 hours.

Applicant and employee drug testing

A fourth of all sheriffs' departments, employing
half of all officers, required that all applicants
for sworn positions be tested for illegal drug use
(table 9).  A majority of the departments serving
a population of 500,000 or more re-quired a drug
test of all officer applicants, as did 41% of
those serving a population of 100,000 to 499,999.
Applicants for officer positions were least likely
to be tested for drugs in small jurisdictions: 
18% of departments serving a population of 10,000
to 24,999 and 12% of those serving fewer than
10,000 residents had a mandatory drug testing
requirement for applicants.

Note:  Some agencies had more than 1 type of testing program.


Overall, about a fourth of sheriffs' departments,
employing about half of all sheriffs' officers,
had some type of drug testing program that
included regular field officers.  Drug testing
programs that were mandatory for all regular field
officers were reported by 6% of sheriffs'
departments, employing 5% of all officers.  More
common were testing programs limited to officers
suspected of using illegal drugs (13%) or to those
selected through a random selection process (12%). 
Nearly half of the departments serving a
population of 500,000 or more tested regular field
officers suspected of using illegal drugs and 39%
of all sheriffs' officers nationwide were employed
by a department with such a program.  Departments
with a random selection testing program for
regular field officers employed 24% of all
officers nationwide.  

About a fourth of all sheriffs' departments
included civilian employees under one or more
types of drug testing program.  These departments 
employed about half of all nonsworn sheriffs'
department personnel.  

Twelve percent of departments, employing 35% of
all nonsworn employees, had a testing program for
such employees suspected of using illegal drugs. 
This included nearly half of the departments
serving a population of 1 million or more, and
about a third of those serving a population of
250,000 to 999,999.  Mandatory and random
selection drug testing programs for civilian
employees were both found among 8% of all
departments; however, departments with random
selection programs employed twice as many civilian
personnel nationwide as those with a mandatory
testing program (18% versus 9%).

Expenditures and pay
--------------------

Operating expenditures

The total annual operating expenditure of
sheriffs' departments during fiscal year 1993 was
$10.7 billion, an increase of 17% compared to
1990. After controlling for inflation, the net
increase in spending was about 6%. (These figures
do not include capital expenditures such as those
for equipment purchases or construction projects.) 
Sheriffs' departments accounted for 26% of the
$41.9 billion in total operating expenditures for
all State and local law enforcement agencies
during fiscal year 1993.

Operating expenditures averaged about $3.5 million
per sheriffs' department for fiscal 1993, ranging
from an average of  $132,467,000 for departments
serving a population of 1 million or more, to
$273,000 among those serving fewer than 10,000
residents (table 10).  The overall operating cost
per resident was $45, with departments in
jurisdictions with a population of 1 million or
more costing the most to operate, $60 per
resident, followed by those in jurisdictions with
fewer than 10,000 residents at $48 per resident. 
Departments in jurisdictions with a population of
25,000 to 49,999 residents had the lowest per
resident cost--$34.

Nationwide, sheriffs' departments cost $66,500 per
sworn officer to operate for fiscal 1993, ranging
from $104,700 per officer in jurisdictions with
more than 1 million residents to $39,500 per
officer in jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000
residents.  When both sworn and nonsworn employees
are included, the average operating expenditure
for sheriffs' departments was $45,900 per employee
for the year, ranging from a high of $66,600 per
employee in jurisdictions with 1 million or more
residents to a low of $27,600 in the smallest
jurisdictions.  Overall, employee salaries and
benefits accounted for about $4 of every $5 in
sheriffs' department 
operating expenditures.

Salaries

The average base starting salary offered by
sheriffs' departments to entry-level deputies was
about $19,300 in 1993.   This was an increase of
11% compared with 1990; however, the net increase 
after controlling for inflation was just 0.3%
(table 11).  Departments in jurisdictions with
50,000 or more residents had an average starting 
salary that was higher than the overall average,
ranging from $20,600 (population of 50,000 to
99,999) to $28,300 (population served of 1 million
or more).  The average starting salary for
deputies in departments serving a population of
less than 10,000 was about $2,000 below the
overall average.  When departments are weighted
according to number of officers employed, the
estimated average base starting salary for
entry-level deputies in 1993 was $23,300.



Except for the largest agencies, base starting
salaries for entry-level officers were generally
lower in sheriffs' departments than in comparably
sized local police departments (figure 4). The
greatest difference was found among agencies with
at least 25 officers but fewer than 250--about
$5,000 per year on average.  

Among agencies employing fewer than 25 full-time
officers, local police departments offered an
average starting salary that was about $1,600
higher than sheriffs' departments.  Among agencies
with 250 to 999 full-time sworn personnel, the
difference was about $3,400.  Sheriffs'
depart-ments employing 1,000 or more sworn
personnel offered a starting salary to entry-level
officers that was slightly higher than in local
police departments.

Salaries for the positions of sergeant and sheriff
increased with jurisdiction size in a pattern
similar to that for entry-level officers.  By
department, the average starting salary for
sergeants was $24,400, with sergeants in the
largest jurisdictions starting at $40,200 on
average, about twice as much as in departments in
the smallest jurisdictions ($20,600).  When
departments are weighted according to size, the
estimated average base starting salary for
sergeants was $31,100.

The overall average base starting salary for
sheriffs in 1993 was $37,700, but sheriffs in
jurisdictions with 100,000 or more residents had a
starting salary that was considerably higher.  The
average starting salary for sheriffs in
jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents was
$89,800, more than 3 times as much as in
jurisdictions with a population of less than
10,000 ($26,700).  

Special pay

Some sheriffs' departments offered certain types
of special pay to full-time officers (table 12). 
For example, 16% of sheriffs' departments,
employing 45% of all sheriffs' officers
nationwide, offered education incentive pay to
qualifying officers.  About two-thirds of the
sheriffs' departments in jurisdictions with a
population of 1 million or more offered education
incentive pay to officers; however, less than 10%
of agencies serving fewer than 25,000 residents
offered this type of pay.

Fifteen percent of all sheriffs' departments
offered shift differential pay to their full-time
officers.  More than half of the departments in
jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents,
and more than a third of those serving 100,000 to
999,999 residents, had shift differential pay. 
Nationwide, about a fourth of all sheriffs'
officers were employed by a department with shift
differential pay.

Thirteen percent of all sheriffs' departments
offered merit pay to qualifying officers,
including 42% of those serving a population of 1
million or more.  About a third of all sheriffs'
officers nationwide worked for a department that
offered merit pay.

Hazardous duty pay was offered by just 5% of all
sheriffs' departments; however, 42% of the
departments in jurisdictions with a population of 
1 million or more offered it, as did more than 20%
of the departments in jurisdictions with 250,000
to 999,999 residents.  Nationwide, a fourth of all
sheriffs' officers were employed by 
a department that offered hazardous duty pay.

Collective bargaining and union membership

Nationwide, 30% of all sheriffs' departments,
employing 47% of all officers, authorized
collective bargaining for sworn personnel (table 
13).  A majority of the departments serving a
population of 100,000 or more authorized
collective bargaining for officers, including
about three-fourths of the departments in
jurisdictions with a population of 500,000 or
more.  Departments in jurisdictions with fewer
than 25,000 residents were the least likely to
authorize collective bargaining for sworn
personnel.

Nonsworn personnel in sheriffs' de-partments were
slightly less likely to have collective bargaining
rights than sworn employees.  Overall, 24% of
sheriffs' departments, employing 41% of all
nonsworn sheriffs' department personnel,
authorized collective bargaining for civilian
employees.  A majority of the departments in
jurisdictions with a population of 250,000 or more
authorized collective bargaining for civilians;
however, just 1 in 10 departments serving a
population of less than 10,000 did so.  

Twenty-four percent of all sheriffs' departments
authorized police union membership by their sworn
personnel, including a majority of those in
jurisdictions with 500,000 or more residents
(table 14).  Nationwide, 43% of all sheriffs'
officers were employed by a department that
authorized them to belong to a police union.

Crime investigation

About 9 in 10 sheriffs' departments had primary
responsibility for investigating violent crimes
occurring in their jurisdiction (table 15). 
Departments in jurisdictions with a population of
less than 100,000 were more likely to be
responsible for investigating violent crimes than
those in larger jurisdictions.  Departments
serving a population of 500,000 to 999,999 were
the least likely to be the primary investigative
agency for violent crimes.

/aRape, robbery or assault.
/bBurglary, larceny/theft, or motor vehicle theft.


Ninety-two percent of sheriffs' departments had
primary responsibility for  investigating property
crimes such as burglary, larceny, or motor vehicle
theft. As with violent crimes, departments serving
a population of 500,000 to 999,999 were the least
likely to be responsible for investigating
property crimes, and those serving fewer than
100,000 residents were the most likely to handle
such investigations.  

Eighty percent of sheriffs' departments were
responsible for investigating arson incidents. 
Again, those serving a population of less than
100,000 were most likely to handle such cases, and
those serving a population of 500,000 to 999,999
were least likely.  

An estimated 22% of sheriffs' departments were
responsible for the investigation of environmental
crimes, with only a slight variation by population
category.

Investigative support functions

Some sheriffs' departments had primary
responsibility for investigative support functions
such as fingerprint processing, laboratory testing
of substances, or ballistics testing (table 16). 
A majority were responsible for fingerprint
processing (55%), including about  two-thirds of
those in jurisdictions with a population of 1
million or more, or a population of 100,000 to
499,999.  Nearly three-fourths (71%) of sheriffs'
officers nationwide were employed by a department
that was responsible for fingerprint processing.

Overall, few sheriffs' departments were
responsible for laboratory testing of substances
(5%) or ballistics testing (2%).  Departments in
jurisdictions with a population of 1 million or
more were the most likely to be responsible for
these functions: 38% conducted laboratory tests of
substances and 33% conducted ballistics tests. 
Less than 10% of the departments in jurisdictions
with a population of less than 250,000 performed
these functions.

Drug and vice enforcement

An estimated 78% of all sheriffs' departments had
primary responsibility for drug enforcement in
their jurisdiction, and these departments employed
78% of all sheriffs' officers nationwide (table
17).  Departments in jurisdictions with a
population of less than 25,000 (85%) were the most
likely to be responsible for drug enforcement,
while those in jurisdictions with 500,000 to
999,999 residents (47%) were the least likely.

About half of all sheriffs' departments, employing
two-thirds of all sheriffs' officers, had primary
vice enforcement responsibilities.  By population
category, slightly more than half of the
departments in jurisdictions with a population of
1 million or more or a population of 25,000 to
499,999 were responsible for vice enforcement. 
Slightly less than half of the departments in
other population categories were responsible for
vice enforcement.
  
Patrol and response  

Eighty-eight percent of all sheriffs' departments
were responsible for providing routine patrol
services in their jurisdiction (table 18).  About
90% of the departments in jurisdictions with a
population of less than 50,000 provided patrol
services.  Except for departments serving a
population of 500,000 to 999,999 (53%), a large
majority of the departments serving other
jurisdiction sizes also provided patrol services. 
Nationwide,  86% of all sheriffs' officers were
employed by a department that performed patrol
services.

About 9 in 10 sheriffs' departments reported they
had primary responsibility for receiving calls for
service from citizens.  The percentage of
departments that received service calls was 90% 
or higher in all population categories less than
100,000.  About 4 in 5 sheriffs' departments also
had responsibility for dispatching calls for
service to officers in the field, with departments
serving a population of less than 50,000 the most
likely to perform dispatch services.  

911 emergency telephone system

In 1993, 65% of all sheriffs' departments
participated in an emergency telephone system
whereby one of their units could be dispatched as
a result of a citizen call to 911 or its
equivalent (table 19).  This was a significant
increase from 1990 when 42% of all sheriffs'
departments were 911 participants, and more than
twice the percentage of departments reporting 911
participation in 1987 (28%) (figure 5).  A
majority of the sheriffs' departments in each
population category were participating in a 
911 system in 1993, including more than 70% of
those serving a population of 25,000 to 499,999.

Note:  Participation is defined as the capability 
to dispatch a unit as the result of a call to 911.  
Detail may not add to total because of rounding.

In 1993, slightly over half of the sheriffs'
departments with a 911 system reported their
system was an enhanced system, capable of
pinpointing the location of a caller
automatically.  This was in sharp contrast to 1990
and 1987, when just a fourth of the sheriffs'
departments with a 911 system had an enhanced
capability.  The percentage of sheriffs'
departments that had an enhanced 911 system in
1993 (36%) was about 3 times greater than in 1990
(11%), and about 4 times greater than in 1987
(8%).

Departments in jurisdictions with a population of
250,000 to 499,999 (68%) and those in
jurisdictions with 50,000 to 249,999 residents
(61%) were the most likely to have an enhanced 911
system, while those in jurisdictions with a
population less than 10,000 (13%) were the least
likely.  A majority of the 911 systems operated by
sheriffs' departments in each population category
of 25,000 or more were enhanced systems.  

In 1993, 79% of all sheriffs' officers worked for
a department with 911, and 60% worked for one with
enhanced 911.  The comparative percentages for
1990 were 68% and 36%, respectively. 

Traffic-related functions

About three-fourths of sheriffs' departments were
responsible for the enforcement of traffic laws
(77%), while about two-thirds handled accident
investigation (69%), and traffic direction and
control (64%) (table 20).  At least half of the
departments in each population category under
500,000 had traffic-related responsi-bilities,
with departments serving a population of less than
100,000 the most likely to perform such duties. 
More than 80% of the departments serving a
population of less than 10,000 were responsible
for traffic enforcement (84%) and accident
investigation (81%).

Jail- and court-related functions

To a much greater extent than their local police
counterparts, sheriffs' departments were
responsible for functions related to court and
jail operations.  Nearly all sheriffs' departments
had primary responsibility for serving civil
process (97%) and providing court security (93%),
while 79% operated a jail (table 21).   For the
large majority of departments, these duties were
in addition to traditional law enforcement
responsibilities.

Nearly all of the sheriffs' departments serving a
population of less than 1 million were responsible
for serving civil process. About three-fourths of
those in jurisdictions with a population of 1
million or more had process-serving
responsibilities.  Nationwide, 92% of all
sheriffs' officers were employed by a department
that handled process serving. 

More than 90% of the departments serving a
population of less than 500,000 provided court
security services, as did 88% of those serving a
population of 500,000 to 999,999.  Departments in
jurisdictions with a population of 1 million or
more (68%) were the least likely to provide court
security.  Eighty-nine percent of all sheriffs'
officers were employed by a department that
provided court security. 

About 4 in 5 sheriffs' departments operated at
least one jail during 1993.  Among departments in
jurisdictions with a population of 1 million or
more or a population of 10,000 to 249,999, about 5
in 6 operated a jail, a slightly higher proportion
than in other population categories.  Ninety
percent of all sheriffs' officers nationwide were
employed by a department that operated one or more
jails.  

Lockup facilities

Just 6% of sheriffs' departments were operating a
lockup facility in 1993 (table 22).  Lockup
facilities are temporary holding facilities
operated separately from a jail with a limited
holding time--an average maximum holding time of
12 hours was reported by the departments that
operated such a facility.  About 3 in 10 
departments in jurisdictions with a population of
250,000 to 999,999 were operating a lockup, as
were about 4 in 10 departments in jurisdictions
with 1 million or more residents.  The average
total lockup capacity for all departments with a
lockup was 49 persons, ranging from 137 in
jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents to
4 in jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000
residents.

Special public safety functions

Another important area of responsibility for
sheriffs' departments in 1993 involved the
performance of special functions related to public
safety.  Examples of such functions included
search and rescue, animal control, civil defense,
emergency medical services, and fire services. 
About two-thirds of all departments were
responsible for search and rescue, including a
majority of the departments in all population
categories except 500,000 to 999,999 (table 23). 
The percentage of sheriffs' departments
responsible for search and rescue operations was
highest among those serving a population of less
than 10,000 (73%).

About a fourth of sheriffs' departments had
primary responsibility for animal control. 
Departments in jurisdictions with a population of
less than 10,000 (38%) were the most likely to
provide animal control services, followed by those
in jurisdictions with a population of 10,000 to
49,999 (29%), and those with a population of
50,000 to 99,999 (26%).  Less than 10% of
sheriffs' departments serving a population 
of more than 500,000 were responsible for animal
control.

Twenty-two percent of all sheriffs' departments
were responsible for civil defense functions,
including 34% of those in jurisdictions with fewer
than 10,000 residents.  Smaller percentages of
sheriffs' departments provided emergency medical
services (13%) or fire services (8%).  None of the
departments in jurisdictions with 1 million or
more residents was responsible for providing these
services. 

Training academy operation

Another area of responsibility for 9% of sheriffs'
departments was the operation of a training
academy (table 24).   Although just 1 in 11
departments operated their own training academy, 
these departments employed 38% of all sheriffs'
officers.  Two-thirds of the departments in
jurisdictions with a population of 1 million or
more operated a training academy, as did nearly
half of those in jurisdictions with 500,000 to
999,999 residents.  Less than 10% of the sheriffs'
departments in jurisdictions with a population of
less than 50,000 operated a training academy.

Sidearms

In 1993, 82% of sheriffs' departments, employing
91% of all sheriffs' officers, authorized the use
of some type of semiautomatic weapon as a sidearm
(table 25).  These figures represent increases
compared to 1990, when 73% of departments,
employing 83% of all officers, authorized
semiautomatic sidearms.

Note:  Specific calibers of sidearms listed in table are limited to those for which at least 10% of all 
agencies authorized.

Sheriffs' departments serving a population of 1
million or more (96%) were the most likely to
authorize semiautomatic sidearms in 1993.  Such
weapons were least likely to be authorized  by
departments in jurisdictions with a population of
less than 25,000, where just under 80% of
departments authorized them.

As in 1990, the 9mm semiautomatic was the most
popular type of sheriffs' sidearm, with 65% of
sheriffs' departments authorizing its use by
officers.  Forty-two percent of departments
authorized .45-caliber semiautomatic sidearms. 
Smaller percentages authorized 10mm (18%) or
.380-caliber semiautomatics (11%).   

About two-thirds (65%) of sheriffs' departments
authorized the use of one or more types of
revolvers by officers, with .357-caliber (57%) and
.38-caliber (34%) revolvers the types most
commonly authorized.  

A majority (58%) of sheriffs' departments supplied
sidearms to officers, and another 5% provided a
cash allowance to officers for the purchase of
sidearms (table 26).  At least 70% of the
departments in each population category of 50,000
or more supplied sidearms, compared to 44% of
those serving a population of less than 10,000. 
Overall, about three-fourths of all sheriffs' 
officers nationwide were employed by a department
that either supplied sidearms (71%) or provided a
cash allowance for their purchase (6%).

Body armor

Sixty-eight percent of sheriffs' departments,
employing 76% of all officers, supplied protective
body armor to their regular field officers (table
27).  An additional 4%, employing 6% of all
officers, provided a cash allowance for
armor.  At least 62% of the departments in each
population category supplied body armor, including
more than 70% of those serving a population of
25,000 to 499,999.  Departments in jurisdictions
with a population of 500,000 to 999,999 (12%) were
the most likely to provide a cash allowance for
the  purchase of body armor.

In 1993, 35% of sheriffs' departments required at
least some of their regular field officers to wear
protective armor while on duty (table 28). These
agencies employed nearly half of all sheriffs'
officers.

The percentage of sheriffs' departments requiring
all regular field officers to wear body armor
increased from 21% in 1990 to 30% in 1993.  Such
an increase was seen in all population categories
(figure 6).  In jurisdictions with 500,000 or more
residents, 28% of the sheriffs' departments
required all officers to wear armor in 1993,
compared to 19% in 1990.  Among departments
serving a population of 100,000 to 499,999, the
increase was from 26% to 36%, and among those
serving a population of 25,000 to 99,999, the
increase was from 21% to 36%.  Among departments
serving fewer than 25,000 residents, 26% required 
all officers to wear armor in 1993, compared to
19% in 1990.  The percentage of all sheriffs'
officers employed by a department with such a
policy increased from 23% in 1990 to 35% in 1993.  

Nonlethal weapons

In nearly all sheriffs' departments (97%),
officers were authorized to use one or more types
of nonlethal weapons (table 29).  Impact devices
such as batons were the type most commonly
authorized: 85% of all departments, employing 94%
of all officers, authorized this type of nonlethal
weapon.  The second most popular category of
nonlethal weapon, chemical agents, were authorized
by 77% of all departments.  These departments
employed 84% of all officers.  About a fourth of
all departments, employing about a third of all
officers, authorized the use of one or more types
of electrical devices as nonlethal weapons.

Among chemical agents, pepper spray (56%) was the
one most commonly authorized (table 30).  The
percentage of departments authorizing pepper spray
was highest among those serving a population of
500,000 to 999,999 (78%) or 100,000 to 249,999
(75%). Overall, 64% of a sheriffs' officers were
employed by a department that authorized the use
of pepper spray.

Traditional batons (52%) and PR-24 batons (51%)
were the only nonlethal weapons other than pepper
spray authorized by at least half of all sheriffs'
departments.  Departments serving a population of
1 million or more (82%) were the most likely to
authorize the traditional baton, while those in
the 250,000 to 499,999 population category (68%)
were the most likely to authorize use of the PR-24
baton.   Collapsible batons were authorized  by
37% of all departments, including a majority of
those serving a population of 500,000 to 999,999. 


An estimated 64% of sheriffs' officers nationwide
worked for a department that authorized them to
use a traditional baton, 61% for a department that
authorized the PR-24 baton, and 51% for a
department authorizing the collapsible baton.  

Thirty-five percent of sheriffs' departments
authorized the use of tear gas.  Departments were
more likely to authorize tear gas in the personal
issue size (27%) than in the bulk form (15%). 
About half of all sheriffs' officers were employed
by a department that authorized the use of tear
gas in one or more forms. 

About a fourth of sheriffs' departments authorized
the use of stun guns. Fifteen percent authorized
the use of flash/bang grenades, including a
majority of those serving a population of 500,000
or more.  Just 10% of all departments authorized
the use of carotid holds or choke holds; however,
nearly half of the departments serving a
population of 1 million or more (47%) authorized
officers to use a carotid hold.

Vehicles

Nationwide, sheriffs' departments operated about
52 cars per 100 sworn personnel (table 31).  The 
ratio of cars to officers increased as population
decreased, ranging from 29 cars per 100 officers
in jurisdictions with 1,000,000 or more residents
to more than 70 per 100 in jurisdictions with
fewer than 25,000 residents.  An estimated 37% of
the cars operated by sheriffs' departments were
unmarked.  The proportion of cars that were
unmarked ranged from about half in jurisdictions
with a population of 500,000 or more to about a
fourth in jurisdictions with a population of less
than 25,000.

Eighty-four percent of sheriffs' departments,
employing 73% of all sheriffs' officers, allowed
sworn personnel to take marked vehicles home
(table 32).  About 9 in 10 departments in
jurisdictions with fewer than 25,000 residents had
such an allowance, as did about 8 in 10
departments in jurisdictions with a population of
25,000 to 249,999.  Less than half of the
departments in jurisdictions with a population of
500,000 or more allowed marked vehicles to be
taken home by officers.

In a large majority of the sheriffs' departments
that allowed marked vehicles to be taken home,
officers were allowed only to drive the vehicle to
and from work.  Just 22% of all departments
allowed officersto operate a marked vehicle for
private errands, ranging from 5% in jurisdictions
with a population of 1 million or more to 29% in
jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000 residents.

An estimated 30% of sheriffs' departments operated
at least 1 boat, including 56% of those 
serving a population of 1 million or more (table
33).  Nearly half of the departments in
jurisdictions with a population of least 50,000
but less than 1 million also operated 1 or more
boats.  Small percentages of sheriffs' departments
operated airplanes (5%) or helicopters (3%);
although about 1 in 3 departments in jurisdictions
with a million or more residents did so.  Just
over  half of sheriffs' officers were employed by
a department with at least  1 boat, while a fourth
were employed by a department with at least 1
airplane or helicopter.

Animals

An estimated 39% of sheriffs' departments
maintained 1 or more dogs for use in activities
related to law enforcement, including a majority 
of  those serving a population of 50,000 or more
(table 34).  In general, the proportion of
departments using dogs declined with size of
population served.  About 5 in 6 departments in
jurisdictions with a population of 1 million or
more used dogs, compared to 1 in 6 departments
serving fewer than 10,000 residents.  Nationwide,
sheriffs' departments maintained about 3,000 dogs
for activities related to law enforcement, and
departments using dogs employed about
three-fourths of all sheriffs' officers.

Just 4% of all sheriffs' departments used horses
for law enforcement purposes, with those in
jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents
(28%) the most  likely to be maintaining at least
1 horse.  Sheriffs' departments collectively 
maintained approximately 1,000 horses, and those
using horses employed 21% of all sheriffs' 
officers.

Computers
---------

Types of computers used

An estimated 82% of all sheriffs' departments were
using 1 or more types of computers in 1993,
compared to 63% in 1990.  Well over 90% of the
departments in jurisdictions with 50,000 or more
residents were using computers, including all
departments serving a population of 1 million or
more (table 35).  A large majority of the
departments serving a population of 25,000 to
49,999 (86%) and those serving a population of
10,000 to 24,999 (80%) were also using computers. 
About two-thirds of the sheriffs' departments in
jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000 residents
were using computers.  The percentage of all
sheriffs' officers nationwide that were employed
by a department using computers increased from 89%
in 1990 to 96% in 1993.

The type of computer most commonly used by
sheriffs' departments in 1993 was the personal
computer, used by two-thirds of all departments. 
This represented an increase compared to 1990 when
just under half of all departments were using
personal computers.  A majority of the departments
in each population category were using personal
computers with the exception of those serving
fewer than 10,000 residents (49%).  About 90% of
the departments serving a population of 250,000 or
more were using personal computers in 1993, as
were more than 80% of those serving a population
of 50,000 to 249,999.  Overall, sheriffs'
departments using personal computers in 1993
employed 87% of all sheriffs' officers.  

Nearly half of all sheriffs' departments were
using a mainframe computer (47%) in 1993 compared
to just under a third in 1990.  At least
two-thirds of the departments in each population
category of 50,000 or more were using a mainframe
in 1993, including 91% of those serving a
population of 1 million or more.  About 1 in 6
departments were using a minicomputer, including 
a majority of those in jurisdictions with a
population of 500,000 or more.  Departments using
mainframes employed 73% of all officers in 1993,
and those using minicomputers about 42%.  

More than 3 times as many sheriffs' departments
were using laptop computers in 1993 (17%) as in
1990 (5%).  Nearly two-thirds of the departments
in jurisdictions with a population of 1 million or
more (64%) were using laptops in 1993, as were
about half of those serving a population of
250,000 to 999,999.  Departments using laptop
computers in 1993 employed about half of all
sheriffs' officers.

An estimated 4% of sheriffs' departments were
using mobile digital terminals in 1993, with about
three-fourths of these departments using the
car-mounted type and a fourth the hand-held
variety.  Overall, 18% of sheriffs' departments
were using either laptop computers or mobile
digital terminals in 1993 compared to 6% in 1990. 
During the same period, the percentage of officers
working in a department that utilized laptops or
mobile digital terminals nearly doubled--from 28%
to 54%.
 
Computer functions

For each of the management functions included in
the LEMAS survey, the percentage of sheriffs'
departments that were utilizing computers to
perform that function was greater in 1993 than in
1990.  An estimated 65% of sheriffs'  departments,
employing 88% of all officers, were using
computers for recordkeeping in 1993 (table 36). 
This included more than 90% of the departments
serving a population of 500,000 or more and more
than 80% of those serving a population of 50,000
to 499,999.

About half of all sheriffs' departments utilized
computers for criminal investigations (52%) or
jail management (47%).  A majority of the
departments serving a population of 25,000 or more
used computers for these purposes.  Other
functions for which computers were used by more
than a third of sheriffs' departments included
dispatch (41%)  and budgeting (37%).  A majority
of the departments serving a population of 50,000
or more used computers for these functions.  About
a fourth of sheriffs' departments used computers
for crime analysis or fleet management.

Overall, about two-thirds of all sheriffs'
officers worked for a department that used
computers for criminal investigations or dispatch,
and nearly three-fourths were employed by a
department that used computers for jail management
or budgeting.  About half worked for a department
that used computers for crime analysis or fleet
management. 

Computerized files

Nearly two-thirds of sheriffs' departments (62%)
were maintaining computerized files on warrants in
1993, and a majority (58%) had computerized arrest
files (table 37).  More than two-thirds of the
departments in each population category of 50,000
or more had computerized arrest files in 1993, and
more than three-fourths of the departments in each
of these population categories had computerized
warrant information.

Nearly half of all sheriffs' departments had
computerized files on stolen property (48%) and
criminal histories (46%).  A majority of the
departments serving a population of 50,000 or more
maintained computerized criminal history
information during 1993, including 87% of those
serving a population of 1 million or more. 

Other types of computerized information files
maintained by at least a third of all sheriffs'
departments in 1993 included calls for service
(42%), agency personnel (41%), stolen vehicles
(41%), summary Uniform Crime Reports (37%),
traffic citations (36%), inventory (35%), and
summonses (34%). Except for the 500,000 to 999,999
population category, a majority of the departments
in each category of 25,000 or more maintained
com-puterized information on calls for 
service.  A majority of the departments serving a
population of 50,000 or more had computerized 
personnel information. 

For each subject area covered by the LEMAS survey,
sheriffs' departments were more likely to be
main-taining that type of information in a
computerized format in 1993 than in 1990 (figure
7).  For example, the 62% of departments with
computerized warrant information in 1993
represented a significant increase over 1990, when
47% of departments had this type of information
computerized.  Similar increases in use of
computerized files were seen for arrests (58% in
1993 versus 42% in 1990), stolen property (48%
versus 34%), criminal history information (46%
versus 35%), and calls for service (42% versus
28%).

Less than a third of sheriffs' departments
reported that they maintained computer files
containing information on the following:  traffic
accidents (29%), evidence (29%), vehicle
registration (28%), payroll (26%), driver's
license information (26%), incident-based Uniform
Crime Reports (24%), and fingerprints (7%) (table
38).  A majority of the departments in
jurisdictions with a population of 1 million or
more  maintained computerized files on evidence
and fingerprints.  A majority of the departments
serving  a population of 100,000 or more had
computerized payroll information.

Policy directives
-----------------

An estimated 90% of all sheriffs' departments
maintained a written policy directive on the use
of deadly force, including 94% or more of those in
each population category of 25,000 or more.  More
than 80% had written directives pertaining to
employee conduct and appearance (86%), and pursuit
driving (83%).  Overall, departments with a policy
directive on deadly force employed 97% of all
sheriffs' officers nationwide; those with a
directive on employee conduct and appearance, 95%
of all officers; and those with a directive on
pursuit driving, 89% of all officers.

More than three-fourths of all sheriffs'
departments had written policy directives
pertaining to the handling of juveniles (79%) and
domestic disputes (78%).  At least two-thirds had
policy directives that addressed strip searches
(72%), off-duty employment by officers (70%),
citizen complaints (69%), and mentally ill persons
(67%). 

Sheriffs' departments with a policy directive
pertaining to off-duty employment by officers
employed 90% of all sheriffs' officers nationwide. 
Eighty percent or more of all officers were
employed by a department with a policy directive
on the handling of juveniles, strip searches,
citizen complaints, domestic disputes, and
mentally ill persons.  More than 70% of all
sheriffs' officers were employed by a department
with a policy directive on use of confidential
funds and employee counseling assistance.

Except for the subjects of juveniles, private
security firms, and homeless persons, departments
serving fewer than 10,000 residents were less
likely than those in larger jurisdictions to have
a policy directive for each subject area covered
by the LEMAS survey. A majority of these smaller
departments, however, did have a directive
covering most of the subject areas included in the
survey.

Methodology
-----------

The Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) survey collects data from a
nationally representative sample of the more than
17,000 publicly funded State and local law
enforcement agencies in the United States.  This
report focuses on sheriffs' departments and
offices operated by a county or independent city
government.  Consolidated police-sheriffs'
departments are defined as local police for the
LEMAS survey.  

The LEMAS survey uses official Census Bureau
county (or equivalent) population figures.  In
many counties, the actual population served by the
sheriff's department for law enforcement purposes
is less than the actual county population due to
the existence of local police departments that
have primary jurisdiction over specified areas
within the county.  However, since other aspects
of sheriffs' department operations, such as those
related to jail and court functions, often involve
serving the entire county, the county population
is deemed appropriate for use as the "population
served" in this report.

All 854 State and local law enforcement agencies
in the United States with 100 or more sworn
officers (as reported in the 1992 BJS Directory
Survey of Law Enforcement Agencies) received the
full-length LEMAS questionnaire.  The 854
self-representing (SR) agencies were supplemented 
by a nationally representative sample of agencies
with fewer than 100 sworn officers.  These
nonself-representing (NSR) agencies were chosen
using a stratified random sample with cells based
on the type of agency (local police, sheriff, or
special police), size of population served, and
number of sworn officers.  The 2,416 NSR agencies
received a slightly abbreviated version of the
LEMAS questionnaire that was mailed to the SR
agencies.

The initial mailing of the survey questionnaire
was conducted in August 1993.  The pay period
containing June 15, 1993, was used as the
reference date for personnel-related questions and
June 30, 1993, for other questions.  The data were
collected by the Bureau of the Census for the
Bureau of Justice Statistics.

After two followup mailings and additional
telephone calls as needed, a final total of 3,028
agencies responded to the LEMAS questionnaire,
including 831 SR agencies and 2,197 NSR agencies. 
The overall response rate was 92.6%.  The final
database includes responses from 1,827 local
police departments, 918 sheriffs' departments, 234
special police departments, and the 49 primary
State police departments.

The base weight for all SR agencies is 1.  For NSR
local and special police departments, the base
weight is 8, and for NSR sheriffs' departments it
is 4.  The final weight associated with every
agency, both SR and NSR, is the product of the
base weight and a factor that adjusted for any
nonresponding agencies in each cell.  This agency
nonresponse factor was based on number of sworn
officers for SR agencies and on number of agencies
for NSR agencies. 

Some responding agencies did not fully complete
the LEMAS questionnaire.  When an agency did not
supply a response to an item, a donor agency was
randomly selected from responding agencies in the
same sample cell.  The donor agency's value for
the item was placed into the nonresponding
agency's response field with an indicator that the
value had been imputed.  Complete documentation
regarding sampling procedures and nonresponse
adjustments is available upon request.  

Because the data from agencies with fewer than 100
sworn personnel were collected from a sample, the
results are subject to sampling error.  All
statements of comparison in this report have been
tested to ensure that observed differences between
values are significant at 2 standard errors (the
95-percent confidence level) or higher.

Data on the number of employees and on the amount
of agency expenditures in this report are not
comparable with figures based on the BJS Survey of
Criminal Justice Expenditure and Employment
series.  In the latter, these data are presented
