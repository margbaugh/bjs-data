--------------------------------------------

About 41% of inmates in the Nation's
State and Federal prisons and local jails
in 1997 and 31% of probationers had
not completed high school or its
equivalent. In comparison, 18% of the
general population age 18 or older had
not finished the 12th grade.

Between 1991 and 1997, the percent of
inmates in State prison without a high
school diploma or GED remained the
same -- 40% in 1997 and 41% in 1991.
Of inmates in State prisons, 293,000 in
1991 and 420,600 in 1997 had entered
prison without a high school diploma, a
44% increase.

Over 9 in 10 State prisons provided
educational programs for their inmates.
Half of State prison inmates reported
they had participated in an educational
program since their most recent
admission to prison. About a quarter of
State inmates had taken basic education 
or high school level courses, and almost 
a third, vocational training. 

Data for this report were taken from the
Survey of Inmates in State and Federal
Correctional Facilities, 1997 and 1991,
the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails,
1996 and 1989, and the Survey of
Adults on Probation, 1995, sponsored
by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS), the Current Population Survey,
1997, sponsored by the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics, and the National Adult
Literacy Survey, 1992, sponsored by
the National Center for Educational
Statistics. 

In personal interviews with nationally
representative samples of inmates in
State and Federal prisons and local jails
and of persons on probation, respondents 
were asked about past educational 
achievements and recent educational 
experiences, as well as about their 
offenses, criminal history, and other 
characteristics. 

The National Adult Literacy Survey,
another personal interview survey,
assessed the literacy levels of persons
in the general population and included 
a short questionnaire about personal
characteristics, including educational
attainment. 

The Current Population Survey (CPS)
primarily collects monthly data on 
labor force participation from a 
nationally representative sample of 
the civilian noninstitutional population. 
In March of each year the CPS also 
collects additional information, 
including educational attainment. 

In addition, some information on
educational programs conducted in 
correctional settings from the BJS
Census of Local Jails, 1999, and the
BJS Census of State and Federal Adult
Correctional Facilities, 2000 and 1995,
has been used (see Methodology for
further information on these data).

Correctional populations less
educated than the general 
population

Correctional populations -- including
State and Federal prison inmates, local
jail inmates, and probationers -- differ
substantially in educational attainment
from persons 18 and older in the general 
civilian noninstitutional population. 

Correctional populations report lower
educational attainment than do those 
in the general population. An estimated
40% of State prison inmates, 27% of
Federal inmates, 47% of inmates in
local jails, and 31% of those serving
probation sentences had not completed 
high school or its equivalent while about 
18% of the general population failed to 
attain high school graduation.

Persons in correctional populations
were more likely than those in the
general population to have passed a
test which indicates the same level of
knowledge as those with a high school
diploma. The Center for Adult Learning
and Educational Credentials of the
American Council on Education develops 
the General Educational Development 
(GED) test for persons who are not 
enrolled in a school. The test assesses 
academic skills and knowledge expected 
of high school graduates. Employers and 
educational institutions usually accept 
the GED as the equivalent of a high school 
diploma.

For a quarter of State prison inmates, a
fifth of Federal inmates, a seventh of jail
inmates, and a tenth of probationers,
as for about 4% of the general population,
** National Center for Education Statistics, 
National Adult Literacy Survey, 1992, "Adult 
Literacy in America, "table 1.1, page 18.** 
passing the GED testing process was the highest 
level of education they attained.

Participation in college-level courses or
post-secondary vocational classes was
less common for those in correctional
populations than for persons in the
general population. An estimated 11%
of State prison inmates, 24% of Federal
inmates, 14% of jail inmates, and 24%
of probationers attended some college
or other postsecondary institution
compared to 48% in the general
population.

Numbers of prison inmates without 
a high school education increased
from 1991 to 1997

The percentage of State inmates
without a high school diploma
remained about the same between the
1991 and 1997 prisoner surveys. About
40% in 1997 and 41% in 1991 did not
have a high school diploma or GED. In
Federal prisons, 23% in 1991 and
27% in 1997, a small but significant
increase, had not finished.

An estimated 420,600 State prison
inmates in 1997 and 293,000 in 1991
did not have a high school education or
a GED -- over a third more in 1997
compared to 1991. In Federal prisons,
almost twice as many, 23,500 in 1997
and 12,600 in 1991, fit that category.

Three-quarters of State prison
inmates did not earn a high school
diploma

Inmate survey respondents who did not
complete high school were asked if they
had received a GED. Respondents who
had completed the 12th grade or who
had attended college-level courses or
post-secondary vocational classes were
asked if they had a high school diploma
or a GED.  All inmates who completed
less than 12 years of schooling and
those who received a GED were
classified as not completing high
school. About 75% of State prison
inmates, almost 59% of Federal
inmates, and 69% of jail inmates did 
not obtain a high school diploma. 

About 35% of State inmates, 33% of
Federal inmates, 22% of jail inmates,
and 11% of probationers had successfully 
passed the GED. Of those with a GED, at 
least 7 in 10 State and Federal inmates 
obtained their GED while incarcerated.

Jail inmates and the general
population reported why they
dropped out of school

Approximately 1 in 6 jail inmates
dropped out of school because they
were convicted of a crime, sent to a
correctional facility, or otherwise
involved in illegal activities. 

Over a third of jail inmates and a sixth 
of the general population said the main
reason they quit school was because of
academic problems, behavior problems,
or lost interest. About a fifth of jail
inmates and two-fifths of the general
population gave economic reasons for
leaving school, primarily going to work,
joining the military, or needing money. 

-----------------------------------------
Educational attainment is defined 
as the last completed year of school 

The definitions and numbers in this
report are as consistent as possible with
those of the National Center for
Educational Statistics and the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. Persons who did not
complete a full year of college were
classified as persons with a high school
diploma, and seniors who did not
complete their last year were coded as
having some college but no college
degree. Any person with 12 or fewer
grades of school and a GED were
included in the group with a GED. 

Some numbers in this report may differ
from those in previously published BJS
reports for which other definitions were
used.
--------------------------------------------

9 in 10 State prisons offer
educational programs

About 9 in 10 State prisons, all Federal
prisons, and almost 9 in 10 private
prisons provide educational programs
for their inmates. These facilities
generally hold persons sentenced to at
least a year in prison, giving inmates a
long period to concentrate on achieving
educational goals. By contrast, local
jails house persons from arraignment
through conviction and for short
sentences. Approximately 6 in 10 local
jails provide educational programs for
their inmates, even though jail inmates
generally stay for short periods. 

The percent of State and private prisons
offering educational programs to their
inmates increased from 1995 to 2000.
In 1995, 88% of State prisons and 72%
of private prisons provided educational
programs; in 2000, 91% of State prisons 
and 88% of private prisons offered 
educational opportunities. During this 
period all Federal prisons offered 
courses. 

Secondary education programs, which
focus on preparing for the GED, were
the most prevalent type of courses in
2000. Over 8 in 10 State prisons, almost
all Federal prisons, about 7 in 10 private
prisons, and over half of jails offered
high school level classes. Next most
common were classes in basic arithmetic a
nd reading, with 8 in 10 State prisons, 
almost all Federal prisons, 6 in 10 private 
prisons, and 1 in 4 local jails offering 
basic education programs.

In State prisons between 1995 and 2000, 
the percentages of prisons offering classes 
increased for basic education (76% to 80%), 
high school courses (80% to 84%), and special 
education programs (33% to 40%), while the
percentage with college classes went down 
(31% to 27%).

Vocational training, special programs
designed to train participants for a job,
were reported by 56% of State prisons,
94% of Federal prisons, 44% of private
prisons, and 7% of local jails. 

Over half of inmates reported taking
an educational program since their
most recent prison admission

Many inmates have taken advantage of
educational opportunities while they
were incarcerated. About 52% of State
prison inmates, 57% of Federal
inmates, 14% of jail inmates, and 23%
of probationers said they had taken
education classes since admission to 
a correctional facility or their most 
recent sentence to probation.

State and Federal inmates had higher
participation rates in 1991 than in 
1997. In 1991, 57% of State prison 
inmates and 67% of Federal inmates 
said they had taken educational 
courses since entering prison. 

Though the rate of participation
decreased, the number of State prison
inmates educated in prison increased
37% -- from 402,500 in 1991 to 550,000
in 1997 -- and the number of Federal
inmates increased 39% -- from 36,200
to 50,300. At the same time, the total
number of inmates in State prisons
increased 49% and in Federal prisons
65%. Participation in prison education
programs did not expand as rapidly as
the population, and as a result the
percentage of inmates in educational
programs fell.

Vocational programs and high school or
GED preparation classes were the most
popular. About a third of State and
Federal prison inmates had attended a
vocational class to learn particular 
job skills.  About a quarter of prison 
inmates took high school level classes. 
Among jail inmates, 5% had vocational 
training and 9%, high school classes.

State prisoners without a high 
school diploma were more likely to
have taken classes since admission

Prison educational resources were
concentrated on those with the greatest
need -- those without a high school
diploma. Approximately 54% of State
inmates who had not completed the
12th grade and 61% with a GED
reported that they had participated 
in educational programs since being
admitted to prison. In contrast, about 
4 in 10 with a high school diploma or
postsecondary courses participated in
an educational program.

More than a third of those who did not
have a high school diploma or GED
took high school classes, and a quarter
participated in a vocational education
program. About 28% of those with a
GED were enrolled in a high school
program and 44% were in vocational
education.

Women in State prison were better
educated than men Women in State prisons 
were more likely than men to have 
received a high school diploma or attended 
an institution of higher learning. About 
36% of women and 32% of men had graduated 
from high school or attended a 
postsecondary institution.

Women in State prison were more likely
to have completed high school than
men and less likely to have passed the
GED. Approximately 30% of women
and 25% of men received high school
diplomas; 28% of women and 35% of
men had a GED. About 4 in 10 men and
women failed to graduate from high
school or pass the GED test. 

About half of female and male inmates
had participated in an educational
program since admission. About 21% of
women and 24% of men took high
school or GED classes; 30% of women
and 32% of men were enrolled in a
vocational program.

Minority State prison inmates were
less likely than whites to have a high
school diploma or GED 

Minority State inmates were generally
less educated than their white peers.
About 44% of black State prison
inmates and 53% of Hispanic inmates
had not graduated from high school or
received a GED compared to 27% of
whites in State prisons.  

Minorities were less likely than whites 
to have attended college or some other
institution of higher learning. About 
1 in 10 blacks and 1 in 13 Hispanics had
studied beyond high school compared
to 1 in 7 whites. Minorities were also
less likely than whites to have earned 
a high school diploma or a GED: 26% of
blacks and 17% of Hispanics, compared
to 30% of whites, had a high school
diploma; 30% of blacks and Hispanics
passed the GED compared to 43% of
whites.

Prison staff had concentrated educational 
services to those most in need of further 
learning. Higher percentages of blacks and 
Hispanics, compared to whites, had taken
educational classes in prison -- about
54% of blacks, 53% of Hispanics, and
49% of whites. About a quarter of
minorities were enrolled in high school
or GED classes while 34% of blacks
and 29% of Hispanics took vocational
training.

----------------------------------------
White, black, and Hispanic male
inmates ages 20 through 39 were
markedly less educated than their
counterparts in the general
population 

Males between the ages of 20 and 39
dominate the State prison population;
they constituted about two-thirds of all
State prison inmates in 1997.
Approximately 21% of the State prison
population were white males between
the ages of 20 and 39, 33% were black
males in that age range, and 12% were
Hispanics. In the general population
these groups constituted a significantly
smaller  percentage of the total
population -- 22%. White males ages 20
through 39 were 17% of the general
population, and blacks and Hispanics of
any race about 3% each.  
 
Within the 20 through 39 age group, male
inmates consistently had less academic
achievement than their counterparts in
the general population. Young white
and black male inmates were about
twice as likely as their counterparts in
the general population to have not
completed high school or its equivalent
-- (14% versus. 28% for whites and 16%
versus 44% for blacks). Young Hispanic
males' educational achievement did not
differ by such magnitude; 52% in prison
and  41% in the general population did
not have a high school diploma or its
equivalent.

Four times as many young males in the
general population as in the prison
population had attended some college
classes or postsecondary courses -- 
54% of whites in the general population
and 11% in prison, 44% of blacks in the
general population and 8% in prison,
and 32% of Hispanics and 7% in prison.
-------------------------------------------

Young inmates were less well
educated than older inmates  

Young State inmates were more likely
than older inmates to have failed to
complete high school or its equivalent.
Over half of inmates 24 or younger had
not completed the 12th grade or the
GED (52%), while just over a third of
those 35 or older did not have a high
school diploma or GED (34% for those
35-44 and 35% for those 45 or older).  

Relatively few young inmates had
pursued a postsecondary education,
particularly compared to older inmates.
An estimated 4% of those 24 or younger, 
10% of those 25 to 34, 14% of those 35 
to 44, and 21% of those 45 or older had 
attended college or another postsecondary 
institution. 

About a third in each age group had
earned a GED. Over 7 in 10 of those
earning their GED had done so in a
correctional facility.

Young inmates were more likely than
older ones to have participated in an
educational program since their
admission to prison (58% for those 24
or younger, 52% of those 25 to 34,
50% of those 34 to 44, and 47% of
those 45 or older). While about 3 in
10 in all age groups had been enrolled
in a vocational program, higher
percentages of young inmates
compared to older groups were
enrolled in GED or high school courses
(36% of those 24 or younger and 15%
of those 45 or older).

Inmates with military service were
better educated than those who had
not served

About 88% of State inmates who had
served in the Army, Navy, Air Force,
Coast Guard, Marines, or other military
service and 56% who had not been in
the military had completed high school
or its equivalent and may have enrolled
in postsecondary courses. Some of this
difference can be explained because
persons who have served in the Armed
Forces meet high entrance requirements 
at enlistment and may subsequently be 
trained while serving in the armed forces.
 
Half of inmates with military service
obtained a high school diploma and
over a third passed the GED; less than
a quarter who did not serve in the
armed forces obtained a high school
diploma and about a third a GED.

Since fewer inmates (12%) with military
experience had not completed high
school or a GED compared to those
without military service (44%), fewer
had enrolled in high school/GED
classes since their admission to prison.
A tenth of those with military service
and a quarter without had taken high
school or GED classes since admission.
About 17% with a military career and
9% without had postsecondary courses.

61% of noncitizens had not
completed high school or a GED

Noncitizens, who may or may not speak
English fluently, are less likely than
citizens to have completed high school
or its equivalent. An estimated 61% of
noncitizens and 38% of inmates with
U.S. citizenship had not graduated from
high school or obtained a GED. Aliens
were less likely than citizens to have
received a high school diploma (19%
versus 26%) or a GED (20% versus
36%).

Just over half of both aliens (54%) and
citizens (52%) had been in an educational 
program since admission.  About 15% of 
aliens were taking a course in English as 
a second language. A quarter of both 
citizens and aliens were studying at the 
high school level.

Inmates raised without two parents
less likely to have a high school
diploma or a GED

State prison inmates who grew up in
homes without two parents, with an
incarcerated parent, or on welfare or in
subsidized housing were less likely than
other inmates to have obtained a high
school diploma/GED or attended a
postsecondary institution.

A larger percentage of State prison
inmates who were raised by a single
parent or other adult, including
relatives, friends, or other adults, 
compared to those who lived in a two-
parent household, failed to obtain a
high school diploma or pass the GED;
43% of inmates raised by one parent,
47% by others, and 34% by both parents 
did not complete a high school diploma/
GED. 

Inmates who reported that a parent had
been incarcerated were less likely to
have completed 11th grade at most,
compared to inmates who did not have
a parent serve time in a correctional
institution (43% versus 39%). Among
inmates with an incarcerated parent,
twice as many received a GED as their
final educational achievement as
received a high school diploma (34%
versus 16%).

An estimated 47% of inmates who
reported that they had either received
welfare or lived in publicly-supported
housing and 35% who received no
government aid did not finish high
school. Those who received public
assistance were likely to obtain a GED
as their highest level of attainment; 
30% received a GED compared to 16% with
a high school diploma.

66% of State prison inmates with
learning disabilities did not 
complete high school or a GED

Among inmates who reported a disability-- 
such as a limiting condition, difficulty 
seeing or hearing, a learning, speech or 
physical disability, or a mental or 
emotional condition -- about 44% did not 
finish high school or its equivalent. 
Thirty-seven percent of those without a 
disability did not complete high school. 

Two-thirds with a learning disability and
6 in 10 with a speech disability did not
complete 12th grade or a GED. 

47% of drug offenders did not have a
high school diploma or a GED

Almost half of State prison inmates
serving their sentence for selling or
using illegal drugs had not graduated
from high school or passed the GED.
About 4 in 10 inmates serving a
sentence for a violent or property
offense had not finished high school.
Violent offenses include homicide,
sexual assault, robbery, and assault,
and property crimes include burglary,
larceny/theft, motor vehicle theft, and
fraud. An estimated 42% of those in
prison for a public-order offense --
primarily weapons, obstruction of
justice, and violations of supervised
release -- did not complete high school
or its equivalent.

Inmate unemployment before 
admission varied with education

Approximately 38% of inmates who
completed 11 years or less of school
were not working before entry to prison.
Unemployment was lower for those with
a GED (32%), a high school diploma
(25%), or education beyond high school
(21%). About 20% without a high school
diploma, 19% with a GED, 14% with a
high school diploma, and 13% with
training beyond high school were not
looking for work. 

Official labor statistics exclude persons
not looking for work. Using that definition, 
the unemployment rate for State prison 
inmates at admission was 21.7% for those 
with less than a high school diploma, 14.6% 
for those with a high school diploma/GED, 
and 9% with education beyond high school. Of 
all inmates, 16.7% were unemployed at admission. 
From 1990 to 1997 when most inmates entered 
prison, national unemployment ranged from 7.5% 
in 1992 to 4.9% in 1997. In 1997 unemployment 
in the general population was 8.1% for those 
25 or older without a high school diploma/GED, 
4.3% for high school graduates, and 2.6% for 
those educated beyond high school. (See
<http://www.bls.gov/cps/ #empstat> tables 1 
and 7.) 

Better educated inmates were more
likely to receive wage income. While
57% of those with less than a high
school education received wages, 76%
with a postsecondary education had
wage income. Those without a high
school diploma/GED were more likely
than those with training after high
school to have income from family or
friends (20% versus 12%), or from
welfare (11% versus 8%). A seventh of
those with some postsecondary training
and almost a third without a high school
diploma had lived with persons who
received government assistance.

Less educated inmates more likely
than more educated to be recidivists

State prison inmates without a high
school diploma and those with a GED
were more likely to have a prior sen-
tence than those with a diploma or
some college or other postsecondary
courses. About 77% who did not
complete high school or a GED, 81%
with a GED, 71% with a high school
diploma, and 66% with some college
were recidivists. 

Less educated inmates were more likely
than those with more education to have
been sentenced as a juvenile. 
Approximately 40% without a high
school diploma, 45% with a GED, 26%
with a high school diploma, and 21%
with some college had prior sentences
as a juvenile either to a facility or 
probation. About 1 in 5 without a high
school diploma or with a GED and 1 in
10 with a diploma or some college had
been incarcerated as a juvenile.

The following data sets were used in this
report.

Bureau of Justice Statistics Surveys

surveys see the following BJS
publications:
 
Survey of Inmates in State and Federal
Correctional Facilities, 1997 and 1991

National Adult Literacy Survey

The National Adult Literacy Survey,
spon-sored by the National Center for
Education Statistics, was conducted in 
1992 to assess literacy skills in the 
general population and background 
characteristics related to those skills. 
A four-stage stratified area sample was 
used to select respondents 16 years of 
age and older from the noninstitutional 
population in the United States. Black 
and Hispanic respondents were sampled at 
a higher rate than the remainder of the 
population in order to increase their 
representation in the sample.  Data 
collection instruments included the 
screener, designed to enumerate household 
members and select survey respondents, 
a background questionnaire, and a literacy 
exercise booklet. The background questionnaire 
collected data on language and educational 
background, political, social, and labor 
force participation, literacy activities and 
demographic information.  Respondents also 
took a test designed to measure their prose, 
document, and quantitative literacy skills. 
Approximately 25,000 persons, paid $20 to 
participate, were interviewed for the study. 
The response rates were as follows: 89.1% 
answered the screener, 81% of those answered 
the background questions, and 95.8% of those 
took the literacy test.

Current Population Survey March
supplement

The Current Population Survey (CPS),
sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
collects labor force data about the civilian
noninstitutional population every month. In
March of each year, in addition to the regular
questions, educational attainment is also
asked. A multistage stratified clustered
sample design is used to select approximately
50,000 housing units each month for
interview. Generally about 6.5% of the
housing units are not interviewed in a given
month due to refusals or failure to make
contact with persons in the dwelling unit.
Data are collected on all persons 15 and older
in each household. Information is obtained
each month for about 94,000 persons 16 years
of age or older.

The accuracy of sample surveys

Sampling error is the variation that may occur
by chance because a sample rather than a
complete enumeration of the population was
conducted. The sampling error, as measured
by an estimated standard error, varies by the
size of the estimate and the size of the base
population.

Estimates of the standard error of some
numbers used in this report are found in the
appendix tables. 

Some standard errors have been calculated to
provide estimates of the sampling variability
around percents in this report.  For example,
the 95-percent confidence interval around the
percentage of State inmates whose high
school graduation was their ultimate
educational attainment is approximately
20.5% plus or minus 1.96 times the standard
error of .4 (or 19.7% to 21.3%. 

Standard errors may also be used to test the
significance of the difference between two
sample statistics or estimates from two
surveys. This is done by pooling the standard
errors of the two sample estimates.  
  
The standard error of the difference between
State and Federal inmates who earned a high
school diploma as their top educational
achievement would be 0.8% (or the square
root of the sum of the squared standard errors
for each group). The 95-percent confidence
interval around the difference would be 1.96
times 0.8% (or 1.5%). Since the difference of
6.5% (27.0% minus 20.5%) is greater than
1.5%, the difference would be considered
statistically significant.
