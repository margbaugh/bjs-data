During fiscal years 1994 and 1995, U.S. district courts terminated
more than 458,000 civil cases.  U.S. district courts have original
jurisdiction in an array of civil matters including civil actions
that-- 

* deal with a Federal question arising from the interpretation and
application of the U.S. Constitution, acts of Congress, or treaties 
* exceed $50,000 and are between parties (citizens or corporations)
residing in different States or parties of a State and citizens,
corporations, or subjects of a foreign country ***Footnote 1:  The
minimum value required was $10,000 until 1989 and $50,000 until
1996, when it was raised to $75,000 in P.L. 104-317, Federal Courts
Improvement Act of 1996. ***
* are commenced by the U.S. Government 
* involve claims arising from the personal injury or property damage
caused by the negligent or wrongful act of the U.S.
Govenment.***Footnote 2:  28 U.S.C. ' 1331, 1332, 1345, and 1346.***

About 18% of civil cases terminated in U.S. district courts involved
tort claims in which plaintiffs alleged injury, loss, or damage from
negligent or intentional acts of defendants.  Of the 82,333 tort
cases that were terminated, 3,356 or 4.1% were decided by a
completed jury or bench trial.  

Of the 78,977 nontrial tort cases, 68% were terminated after the
issue was joined.  An issue is considered joined after the defendant
has answered the complaint or has otherwise responded with Rule 12,
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, or as mandated by the court.  Of
the 53,855 tort cases, 23% were terminated with no court action; 22%
were terminated at the pretrial conference; 19% by some judicial
action by a judge or magistrate but before any pretrial conference;
2% during a jury or bench trial; and 35% by other means.

This report presents findings from a study of tort cases terminated
by trial verdict in U.S. district courts during fiscal years 1994
and 1995.  BJS analyzed data from information compiled by the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC).  

----------------------------------------------------- 

From 1990 to 1995 an average of 1,800 tort case trials 
were conducted in U.S. district courts each year

1990      41,745        2,108
1991      56,159        2,127
1992      46,242        1,874
1993      41,136        1,714
1994      44,390        1,740
1995      37,943        1,616
-----------------------------------------------------

According to the AOUSC, a trial is defined as "a contested
proceeding where evidence is introduced."  A trial is considered
complete when a verdict is returned by a jury or a decision is
rendered by the court. For this report, completed trials were
determined by screening for cases whose procedural progress at
termination was recorded as "terminated after the completion of a
trial by jury or trial before a judge or magistrate."  Jury and
bench trials disposed of before the start of the trial or during the
trial are excluded from the analysis. Award information presented is
for tort cases in which the judgment was for monetary damages.

Tort  trial cases awarding court costs only or court costs and
attorney fees were excluded from the award analysis.  The number of
tort trial cases appealed and the outcomes of appeal are not
reported here.

For purposes of this report, tort cases fall into two categories: 
personal and property.  Personal tort cases involve injury to a
person or to the reputation or feelings of a person.  Property tort
cases involve injury or damage to personal property.  

During 1994-95 in almost all (92%) tort trial cases terminated in
U.S. district courts, plaintiffs cited personal injury as the type
of damage (table 1).  Of these, motor vehicle cases accounted for
19% of tort trial cases, product liability cases including asbestos
16%, and medical malpractice cases 8%.

Jurisdiction refers to the basis for filing the civil action in U.S.
district courts as opposed to State courts.  Diversity of
citizenship was the reason why Federal rather than State courts
handled 69% of the tort trial cases in U.S. district court (table
2).  Eighteen percent of the cases involved a Federal question, and
13% involved the U.S. Government as a plaintiff or a defendant.

Trial terminations
------------------------------

Federal civil trial cases can be decided by either a jury comprised
of 6 to 12 members or a Federal judge or magistrate (bench trial). 
The plaintiff or the defendant may request the case be settled by a
jury trial.  If no request for jury trial is made by either party,
the case is tried by bench trial.  However, in most cases in which
the United States is named as a defendant,Federal law stipulates
that only a bench trial is allowed.***Footnote 3:  28 U.S.C. '
2402.***  Jury verdicts in a Federal civil case must be unanimous
and cannot be taken from a jury reduced to fewer than six members.

----------------
Jury trials 
----------------

Almost three-quarters of tort trial cases were decided by jury
verdict (table 3). Type of termination (jury or bench) varied by the
nature of the Federal jurisdiction.  A majority of diversity of
citizenship (86%) and Federal question (64%) tort trial cases were
decided by jury verdict.

Of the 2,422 tort cases decided by jury trial, 94% were personal
injury cases.  Ninety-two percent of other personal injury product
liability cases were decided by jury trial; 84% of assault, libel,
and slander cases; and 82% of motor vehicle product liability cases. 
All seven of the asbestos product liability cases were terminated by
jury trial.

Bench trials
-----------------

Twenty-eight percent of all tort trial cases were terminated by
bench trial.  Most (88%) of these cases were also personal injury
cases.  Bench trials decided 93% of the tort trial cases in which
the United States was a defendant and 57% of the cases in which the
United States was a plaintiff. 

Over half of other property damage cases (59%) and marine cases
(56%) were decided by bench trial (table 4).

Jury verdicts in tort cases disposed in State courts in the 75
largest counties, 1992

Juries in State general jurisdiction courts in the Nation's 75
largest counties decided an estimated 9,500 tort cases during the
12-month period ending June 30, 1992.  Automobile cases accounted
for 41% of all tort cases settled by jury verdict, premise liability
cases 21%, and medical malpractice cases 14%.  Product liability and
toxic substance cases were 7%.

In half of all tort jury cases, the plaintiff won the decision. 
Plaintiff success varied by type of tort case.  Plaintiffs won in
74% of toxic substance cases, 60% of automobile cases, 41% of
product liability cases, and 30% of medical malpractice cases.

Juries awarded altogether $1.9 billion in compensatory and punitive
damages to plaintiff winners in tort cases.  The median recovery was
$51,000.  Approximately 21% of the final awards to plaintiff winners
in tort cases were over $250,000.  Half the plaintiff winners in
product liability cases were awarded total damages in excess of
$250,000.  About 8% of plaintiff winners received final awards of $1
million or more.  The largest proportion of these $1-million-plus
awards were in medical malpractice cases (25%), followed by product
liability cases (15%).

Juries awarded punitive damages as a part of the overall award in 4%
of the tort cases in which the plaintiff won.  The median punitive
damage award in tort cases was $36,000.  Twenty-three percent of the
punitive damage awards in tort cases were in excess of $250,000, and
10% were $1 million or more.

Plaintiffs won in 142 product liability cases and received punitive
damages in 3 of the cases.  Of the 403 medical malpractice cases
with a plaintiff winner, punitive damages were awarded in 13 cases. 
In 4 of the 13 cases, the punitive damage award was over $250,000.

Trial outcome 
-------------------

Overall, plaintiffs won in 43%, or 1,425, of the tort cases decided
by trial verdict in U.S. district courts (table 5).  Plaintiff
success varied by type of case.  Plaintiffs won in 7 of 10 airplane
product  liability cases and 4 of 7 asbestos product liability
cases.  In over 56% of personal injury cases, Federal employers'
liability and motor vehicle cases, plaintiffs won the trial. 
Plaintiffs were least successful in medical malpractice cases (32%)
and motor vehicle product liability cases (18%).

Trial awards
----------------

Tort cases typically involve a compensatory award for economic
damages, which include all financial losses that are the result of
the defendant's conduct.  Tort cases also can include a compensatory
award for noneconomic damages, which include awards for pain and
suffering and emotional distress. 

Distinct from compensatory damages are punitive damages, which are
almost exclusively reserved for tort claims in which the defendant's
conduct was grossly negligent or intentional.  Under the provisions
of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the United States is not liable for
punitive damages*** Footnote 4:   28 U.S.C. ' 2674. ***  In the
tables and text presented below, award amounts include compensatory
and/or punitive damages.  Due to the nature of the data, award
amounts for the two types of damages cannot be identified
separately.  Additionally, in cases won by plaintiffs, monetary
damages were not always awarded, as other forms of restitution were
also used. 

In 88% of tort trial cases in which the plaintiffs won, the jury or
court awarded damages. The median damage award for all tort cases
was $140,000.  The amount of awarded damages varied by type of case. 

Half of the plaintiff winners in airplane product liability cases
were awarded damages over $999,000.  The median award for plaintiff
winners in airplane personal injury cases was $655,000, for medical
malpractice cases $463,000, and for asbestos product liability cases
$327,000.  

In 18% of the cases with a plaintiff winner, damages awarded were
over $1 million. An award of $1 million or more was received in 46%
of airplane personal injury cases and 29% of medical malpractice
cases; assault, libel, and slander cases; and other property damage
cases.  

In 9% of tort trial cases with plaintiff winners, awards exceeded
$10 million.  Thirteen percent of medical malpractice cases involved
awards of $10 million or more.

-----------------------------------------

Tort trials with the U.S. Government 
----------------------------------------

Litigation involving the U.S. Govern- ment is primarily under the
control of the Attorney General.  The U.S. Code states:  "Except as
otherwise authorized by law, the conduct of litigation in which the
United States, an agency, or officer thereof is a party, or is
interested, and securing evidence therefore, is reserved to officers
of the Department of Justice, under the direction of the Attorney
General." ***Footnote 5:  28 U.S.C. ' 516.***  In recent years
Congress has enacted a number of separate grants of litigation
authority allowing some Federal agencies to have or share
responsibility with the Justice Department for conducting their
litigation.  For example, lawsuits filed under the Longshoremen's
and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act against the Secretary of Labor
can be independently litigated by Department of Labor
attorneys.***Footnote 6: 33 U.S.C. ' 921(a).***  The Environmental
Protection Agency can  litigate cases under the Clean Air Act
independently only if the Attorney General does not provide legal
representation.***Footnote 7: 42 U.S.C. ' 7605.***

Between 1994 and 1995 the U.S. Government was party to slightly more
than 400 tort trial cases--most frequently as a defendant.  As a
plaintiff  the U.S. Government was involved in 14 tort trial cases
terminated in U.S. district courts, winning 5 cases (not shown in a
table).  The U.S. Government as a winning plaintiff received damages
in 4 of these 5 cases.  The median award was $7,000.

Tort actions against the U.S. Government are governed by the Federal
Tort Claims Act.  This act provides the legal mechanism for
compensating persons injured by the negligent or wrongful acts of
Federal employees committed within the scope of their employment. 
An administrative claim to the appropriate Federal agency is a
prerequisite before filing suit in U.S. district court.  If the
claim is denied by the Federal agency in writing or if the Federal
agency does not make a decision about the claim within 6 months,
then the claimant can file suit in U.S. district court.  Lawsuits
under the act can only be tried by bench trial.***Footnote 8:  28
U.S.C. '2671-2680.***

The Torts Branch of the Civil Division within the Department of
Justice represents the United States, its agencies, and its officers
sued in tort actions.  This includes suits against the United States
under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Public Vessels Act, all
admiralty suits, and common-law suits against individual government
employees.***Footnot 9: Urban A. Lester and Michael F. Noone,
Litigation With The Federal Government, 3rd edition.  Philadelphia: 
The American Law Institute, 1994.*** 

U.S. district courts terminated 413 tort trial cases in which the
U.S. Government was the defendant (table 6).  These cases primarily
involved medical malpractice and other types of personal injury.  In
46% of these tort trial cases, the verdict was in favor of the
United States.  In seven of the tort trial cases in which the United
States as a defendant won the judgment, monetary damages were
awarded.  The median award for all cases was $13,000.

or 310 cases and received monetary awards in 271 cases.  Half the
plaintiff winners receiving damages in Federal question cases were
awarded $155,000 or more.   Plaintiffs won the judgment in 57% of
Federal employers' liability cases involving a Federal question. 
Plaintiff winners received awards in 87% of Federal liability cases;
the median amount received was $225,000

Diversity of citizenship cases
-----------------------------------------

The vast majority of tort trial cases terminated by U.S. district
courts entailed diversity of citizenship in which citizens,
including corporations, of different States were involved in a civil
dispute with an amount in controversy exceeding $50,000.  Of the
2,317 diversity of citizenship cases terminated by trial verdict,
plaintiffs won in 40%, or 917, of the cases (table 8).  Plaintiffs
received monetary awards in 821 cases; the median amount awarded was
$136,000.

The case processing time for tort cases varied slightly by type of
trial.  The median case processing time for bench trials was 19.3
months compared to 17.7 months for jury trials (not shown in a
table).

Class actions

During fiscal years 1994-95, four tort class action suits were
terminated by trial in U.S. district courts.  Three of the four
cases were decided by jury trial.  The nature of the case in two of
the four suits was classified by AOUSC as "other personal injury." 
In the remaining two class action suits, one dealt with personal
injury product liability and the other with fraud.  Plaintiffs won
and received monetary awards in 2 of the 4 class action suits. 
Plaintiffs were awarded over $10 million in the diversity of
citizenship other personal injury case and $1,000 in the Federal
question other personal injury case.

Examples of types of cases

Diversity of citizenship cases
----------------------------------------

Personal injury

A civil action was tried in Federal court because a plaintiff in New
Jersey claimed he was struck by a motor vehicle owned by the defendant 
and operated by a defendant in Philadelphia.  Inasmuch as the plaintiff 
is a citizen of New Jersey and the defendants are citizens of 
Pennsylvania, suit was filed in U.S. District Court, Eastern 
District of Pennsylvania.***Footnote a: McNulty v. Travel Park, 
833 F. Supp. 144 (E.D.Pa. 1994).***

---------------------------------------
Assault, libel, and slander
-------------------------------------- 

A plaintiff brought a defamation/invasion of privacy suit against
the defendant to Federal court based on the parties' allegedly
diverse citizenship.  The plaintiff, a citizen of Maryland,
contended that the defendant was a citizen of North Carolina.  The
defendant answered that he was in fact domiciled in and hence a
citizen of Maryland, citing this State as his domicile of origin and
the fact that he owned and paid taxes on certain real estate.

The defendant was born and raised in Maryland and maintained a
residence in the State.  He inherited the residence upon his
mother's death and paid property taxes to the State.  The plaintiff,
however, claimed that the defendant was physically located in and
with his family in North Carolina.  The suit was filed in U.S.
District Court, District of Maryland.***Footnote b: Dyer v.
Robinson, 853 F. Supp. 169 (D.Md. 1994).***  

----------------------------------------
Federal Tort Claims Act cases

Medical malpractice
----------------------------------------

A plaintiff filed suit against the United States of America alleging
that physicians at the Veterans Administration Hospital were
negligent when a piece of gastric tubing was left in the plaintiff's
stomach during an operation.  The plaintiff's complaint claimed
medical negligence and/or malpractice.

The plaintiff's claim against the medical facility was limited
solely to negligence or malpractice in treatment by the medical
facility constituting negligence and/or malpractice within the
meaning of the law.  The suit was filed in U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Louisiana.***Footnote c: Branch v. United States
of America, 1994 WL 507416 (E.D.La.)*** 

------------------
Asbestos
-----------------  

The plaintiffs (inmates) alleged that they were negligently exposed
to asbestos at the USP-Terre Haute Institution and that this
exposure endangered their lives and health.  They alleged that the
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) negligently permitted this condition to
exist.  Their administrative tort claims were denied by the BOP. 
The suit was filed in U.S. District Court, Southern District of
Indiana.***Footnote d: Castor v. United States of America, 883  F.
Supp. 344 (S.D.Ind. 1995).***

Methodology
------------------------   

The primary source of data presented in this report is the Federal
Judicial Center's Integrated Data Base (Civil).  Data tabulations
were prepared from the BJS staff analysis of source agency data
sets.  The Federal civil tort categories used in this report are
based primarily on the codes established by the Administrative
Office of the United States Courts.  Case-level information is
provided by individual U.S. district courts, which submit data to
the AOUSC.  The categories for types of cases used in this report
are based on those defined by the AOUSC.  Therefore, no further
detailed information is available on the large number of  "other
personal injury cases and other product liability cases."  For tort
cases that involved more than one type of action filed, the AOUSC
instructs the plaintiff's attorney if the cause fits more than one
nature of suit, select the most definitive.  It is this first nature
of suit code that was used in the analysis for this report.

Definitions
----------------

After court trial:  The action was disposed of after the completion
of a trial before a judge or magistrate. 

After jury trial:  The action was disposed of after the completion
of a trial before a jury. 

Procedural progress at termination: Indicates the point to which the
action had progressed when it was disposed of.  When used as part of

motor vehicle that results in property damage and personal injury in
an automobile accident.  

U.S. Government defendant:  Actions against agencies and officers of
the United States.

U.S. Government plaintiff:  Actions by agencies and officers of the

in controversy exceeds $50,000 between citizens or corporations of
different States; citizens or corporations of a State and citizens
or subjects of a foreign country; citizens or corporations of
different States where citizens or subjects of a foreign country are
additional parties; or a foreign state as defined in Title 28 U.S.C.
