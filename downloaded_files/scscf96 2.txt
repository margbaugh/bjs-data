Highlights

Prior to 1986, there were no statistics collected on the
sentences convicted felons received in State courts nationwide. 
To close that gap, the Bureau of Justice Statistics initiated
the National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP).  A pilot study
was conducted in 1986. Afterwards, full-scale surveys were
conducted in 1988, 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996.  The NJRP
compiles information on the sentences that felons receive in
State courts nationwide and on characteristics of the felons.

Trends in felony sentencing 
in State courts nationwide

State courts convicted 997,970 adults of a felony in 1996.  That
total represents an average growth of approximately 5% every
year since 1988 (667,366) (page 50).

* Cases took longer for courts to process in 1996 than in 1988. 
The average length of time from arrest to sentencing was 219
days in 1996, or 11 days longer than in 1988 (page 50).  

* Persons age 30 or older comprised 40% of persons convicted in
1988 but 50% in 1996.  The median age of convicted felons was 27
years in 1988 but 30 years in 1996 (page 50).

* The proportion of felons sentenced to prison in 1996 (38%) is
lower than in any previous year (1988 44%; 1990 46%; 1992 44%;
1994 45%) (page 50).

* Prison sentences imposed by State courts are becoming shorter
on average.  In 1992 the average prison sentence length was 79
months; in 1996, 62 months (page 51).

Juveniles transferred to adult court

In 1996, 997,970 persons were convicted of a felony in State
courts.  Some of them were juveniles who had been transferred to
adult courts.  These transfers occurred in one of two ways:
either the case was excluded by statute from the jurisdiction of
the juvenile court (because of the serious charge against the
defendant or because of the defendant's lengthy prior record),
or the juvenile was transferred at the discretion of the
juvenile court or the prosecutor.

* Transferred juveniles differed from other convicted felons in
terms of conviction offenses.  Fifty-three percent of transferred
juveniles had a violent offense as their conviction offense
(table 5.1).  That compares to 17% among adults convicted of a
felony in State courts in 1996.

* Compared to convicted adults, transferred juveniles received
either longer or shorter prison sentences on average, depending
on the offense (table 5.3).  The average prison sentence for
murder was about 23  years among transferred juveniles and 21
years among adults.  The average prison sentence for sexual
assault was 1 year longer for adults (9 years and 9 months) than
for transferred juveniles (8 years and 9 months).

Felony sentences in State courts

* Drug offenders were 35% of felons convicted in State courts in
1996.   Property offenders made up 30%; violent offenders 17%;
those convicted of weapons offenses and other crimes made up the
rest (18%) (table 1.1).   

* In 1996 State courts sentenced 38% of convicted felons to a
State prison, 31% were sentenced to a local jail, and 31% to
straight probation with no jail or prison time to serve (table
1.2).

* State courts sentenced to State prison 57% of felons convicted
of a violent offense, 34% convicted of a property offense, 35%
convicted of a drug offense, and 40% convicted of a weapons
offense in 1996 (table 1.2).

Felons sentenced to probation

* In 1996, 29% of convicted felons were sentenced to straight
probation with no jail or prison time to serve.  The 29%
sentenced to straight probation plus the 29% sentenced to
probation with jail or prison time totals 58% receiving
probation (table 3.2).

Profile of felons convicted

* In 1996 men comprised 84% of persons convicted of a felony
(table 2.1).  An estimated 41% of males received a State prison
sentence, compared to 24% of females (table 2.4).  

* Nationally, of the felons convicted in 1996, 54% were white
(including white Hispanics), 44% were black (including black
Hispanics), and 2% were other races.  The average age of felons
convicted in State courts in 1996 was 31 (tables 2.1 and 2.3). 

Felony case processing

* An estimated 76% of felons convicted by a jury received a
prison sentence, compared to 49% of those convicted by a judge
and 38% of those who pleaded guilty (table 4.4).

* Prison sentences were longer for felons convicted by a jury
trial (12.5 years) than for felons who pleaded guilty (4.5
years) or were convicted at trial by a judge (5 years, 10
months) (table 4.5).

*In 36% of jury trial convictions nationwide, felons were found
guilty of multiple offenses.  Twenty-six percent of the guilty
pleas and 23% of the bench trial convictions involved multiple
offenses (table 4.7).

* Average elapsed time from date of arrest to date of felony 
conviction was about 6 months (182 days).  Jury cases took the 
longest time (over 9 months).  Guilty plea cases took just under 
6 months and bench trials took about 6 months.  The longest average 
time was for murder or nonnegligent manslaughter, about 11« months 
(table 4.9).

* Cases decided by juries had an average elapsed time from
arrest to sentencing of just under 12 months; those disposed by
bench trial had an average of just under 7 months; those
disposed by guilty plea had an average of just under 8 months
(table 4.11).

Methodology
-------------------------------------------------------------

National Judicial Reporting Program

National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP), a biennial sample
survey, compiles information on the sentences that felons
receive in State courts nationwide and on characteristics of the
felons.  Surveys of felony sentencing in State courts were
previously conducted in 1986 (see Felony Sentences in State
Courts, 1986, BJS, NCJ 115210, February 1989), 1988 (see Felony
Sentences in State Courts, 1988, BJS, NCJ 126923, December
1990), 1990 (see Felony Sentences in State Courts, 1990, BJS,
NCJ 149077, September 1994), 1992 (see Felony Sentences in State
Courts, 1992, BJS, NCJ 151167, January 1995), and in 1994 (see
Felony Sentences in State Courts 1994, BJS, NCJ 163391, January
1997).

The 1996 survey was based on a sample of 344 counties selected
to be nationally representative.  Ninety-eight of the 344 were
in the 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994 surveys.  The 344 included the
District of Columbia and at least one county from every State
except, by chance, Delaware, Montana, and Wyoming.  Among
sampled counties, three sentenced no felons during 1996.  The
1996 survey excluded Federal courts and those State or local
courts that did not adjudicate felony cases.  

According to the BJS Federal Justice Statistics Program, Federal
Courts convicted 43,839 persons of a felony offense in 1996. 
That number represents about 4% of the combined State and
Federal total number of felony convictions during 1996.

The 1996 survey included only offenses that State penal codes
defined as felonies.  Felony offenses are widely defined as
crimes that have the potential of being punished by more than 
1 year in prison.  States usually designate specific courts to
try felony offenses, although in some counties more than one
court may handle such cases. 

The term felony is not uniform in either its usage or definition
in the United States.  Two jurisdictions (Maine and New Jersey)
do not use the term to classify their criminal offenses, and six
others offer no explicit definition of the term, even though
they use it as a criminal designation.  In the 43 States that
use and define the term felony, common elements do exist.  With
few exceptions, criminal codes define felonies by reference to
place of imprisonment.  Most often, felony definitions identify
the place of imprisonment but not the duration, as in Idaho,
where a felony is a "crime punishable by death or by
imprisonment in the State prison."  Nearly as frequent is a
definition that specifies the duration of imprisonment but not
the place, as in Georgia, where a felony is a "crime punishable
by death, by imprisonment for life, or by imprisonment for more
than 12 months."  

This publication summarizes results from the 1996 survey.  Each
of the sections addresses a different aspect of felony
convictions in State courts during 1996.

Felony sentences in State courts, 1996

In 1996 State courts convicted over 997,000 adults of murder,
rape, robbery, drug trafficking, and other felony offenses. 
Thirty-eight percent of convicted felons were sentenced to a
State prison, and 31% were sentenced to a local jail (usually
for a year or less).  The remaining 31% were sentenced to
straight probation with no jail or prison time to serve (table
1.2).

Other results include the following:

*  Drug traffickers (21.3%) and drug possessors (13.6%) 
together made up 34.8% of felons convicted in State courts 
in 1996. Violent offenders, consisting of murderers (1.1%), 
sexual assaulters (3.0%), robbers (4.3%), assaulters (7.0), 
and others convicted of a violent crime (1.4%) together made 
up 16.8%.  Burglars (9.3%) and larcenists (12.3%) made up most 
of the rest (table 1.1).

* The average sentence to local jail was 6 months.  The average
probation sentence was just under 3« years (table 1.3).

* Felons sentenced to State prison in 1996 had an average
sentence of just over 5 years. But, assuming they were to serve
the same fraction of their imposed sentence as did those
released in 1996, felons were expected to serve 45% of that
sentence -- or 2 years and 4 months -- before release (table
1.5).

* State courts nationwide sentenced to life 26% of those
convicted of murder or nonnegligent manslaughter (table 1.4).  

* The 997,970 felons sentenced in  1996 were convicted
altogether of about 1.2 million felonies.  The number of felony
convictions exceeds the number of convicted felons because 20%
of the felons were convicted of two felony charges and 4% were
convicted of three or more (table 1.6).

* The likelihood of a prison sentence rose from 35% for those
convicted of one felony, to 45% for two, and 52% for three or 
more (table 1.7).  

* The mean sentence to incarceration also increased from 2.75
years for those convicted of one felony to just over 4 years for
those convicted of two or more (table 1.8).

* A fine was imposed on 20% of  convicted felons, restitution on
14%, community service on 6%, and treatment was ordered for 6%
(table 1.9).

Profile of felons convicted in State 
courts, 1996 

1996 National Judicial Reporting Program compiled demographic
data (sex, race, and age) as well as sentencing information for
persons convicted of a felony in State courts.  This section
summarizes results from that collection.

White defendants, including Hispanics, were 54% of those
convicted of a felony in State courts; black felons, including
Hispanics, were 44%; and persons of other races (American
Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders),
including Hispanics, 2% (table 2.1).  

Among persons convicted, white felons were less likely than
blacks to be sent to prison: 32% of convicted white defendants
received a prison sentence; 46% of black defendants received a
prison sentence (table 2.5).

The average State prison sentence was 1 month longer for whites
than blacks:63 months for whites and 62 months for blacks 
(table 2.7).

Other findings  were -- 
* In 1996 men comprised 84% of persons convicted of a felony
(table 2.1).  An estimated 41% of males received a State prison
sentence, compared to 24% of females (table 2.4).  

* The most serious conviction offense was a violent felony in 9%
of cases for women, and 21% of cases for men.  Among convicted
whites, 19% had a violent felony conviction offense; among
blacks, 20% (table 2.8).

* The average age of felons convicted in 1996 was 31 years
(table 2.3).

* Men sentenced to prison nationwide had an average sentence
length of 5 years and 3 months, while women nationwide had an
average prison sentence of 3 years and 11 months (table 2.6).

* Men nationwide were sentenced to local jail for an average of
6 months, and women for 5 months (table 2.6).  The larger
proportion of violent conviction offenses for men partly
explains their greater likelihood of a sentence to incarceration
and longer average sentences.

Felons sentenced to probation in State 
courts,1996

The detailed statistics on sentences to probation presented in
the tables of this section differ from probation statistics
elsewhere in the report. As used else-where, a sentence to
probation only included "straight probation."  

Excluded were probation sentences combined with a term of
confinement in a prison or jail.  In this section, the probation
definition is expanded to include such "split sentences." 

Defined that way, probation sentences comprised 58% of all
sentences imposed on felons in 1996, the highest percentage of
all sentences since 1990 (table 3.1).

Other probation findings from the 1996 survey 
included --
* State courts sentenced to probation an estimated 580,000
convicted felons (table 3.1).
* Nationwide, probation sentences had an average length of just
under 3«  years (table 3.3).
* For felons receiving a split incarceration and probation
sentence, the average jail sentence was 6 months; the average
prison sentence, 3 years and 10 months (table 3.4).       
* The average age of probationers nationwide was 31 years (table
3.10).  Females made up 19% of all felons placed on probation
(table 3.7).  Whites were 58% of probationers, and blacks were
40% (table 3.8).

Felony case processing in State courts, 
1996

Nationwide in 1996, 91% of convictions were the product of a
guilty plea (table 4.2).  That number is not the same as the
percentage of felony convictions that involved a plea bargain
between the prosecution and the defense.  Plea bargains, in
which the defendant agrees to plead guilty in exchange for
dropped or reduced charges or in exchange for a reduced
sentence, is a common practice in the criminal justice system. 
The proportion of those who pleaded guilty as part of a plea
bargain is not known.

* An estimated 906,000 persons pleaded guilty to a felony
offense (table 4.1).  Of all felony offenses, persons convicted
of murder were the least likely to have pleaded guilty (54%) and
the most likely to have been convicted by a jury (40%) (table
4.2).

* Of felons convicted in State courts, 4% were found guilty by a
jury, and 5% were found guilty by a judge in a bench trial
(table 4.2).  The most serious offenses -- the violent crimes of
murder, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and other
violent offenses -- comprised about 17% of all felony
convictions but an estimated 49% of all jury trials (table 4.3).

* Sentences to prison or jail occurred in 88% of jury
convictions, 62% of bench trial convictions (decided by a judge
alone), and 64% of guilty pleas (table 4.4).

* An estimated 76% of felons convicted by a jury received a
prison sentence, compared to 49% of those convicted by a judge
and 38% of those who pleaded guilty (table 4.4).

* Prison sentences were much longer for felons convicted by a
jury trial (12« years) than for felons who pleaded guilty (4«
years) or were convicted by a judge (5 years and 10 months)
(table 4.5).

* Felons sentenced to jail in a jury trial received a mean or
average sentence of 7 months.  The mean jail sentence in a bench
trial was 8 months; in a guilty plea, 6 months (table 4.5).

* Murderers convicted by a jury were the most likely of all
convicted defendants to have received a life sentence (43%) or
the death penalty (5%).  Sentences to life in prison or death
for murder or nonnegligent manslaughter occurred in about 14% of
the bench trials and 17% of the guilty pleas (table 4.6).

* In 36% of jury trial convictions nationwide, felons were found
guilty of multiple offenses.  Twenty-six percent of the guilty
pleas and 23% of the bench trial convictions involved multiple
offenses (table 4.7).

The following findings on elapsed time are based on cases with
complete disposition information.  Because small differences
exist between cases with complete information and cases with
incomplete information, these statistics may differ from other
elapsed-time statistics derived from the survey:

* Mean elapsed time from date of arrest to date of felony
conviction was about 6 months.  Jury cases took the longest 
time (about 9« months).  Guilty plea cases took just under 6
months and bench trials took about 6 months.  The longest
average time was for murder or nonnegligent manslaughter, just
over 11« months, and the shortest, just over 5a months for
larceny (table 4.9).

* Mean elapsed time from conviction to sentencing for persons
convicted of a felony varied according to the method of
conviction.  Jury cases took the longest time (over 2 months)
and bench cases took the least ( less than half a month) (table
4.10).

* Mean elapsed time from arrest to sentencing in 1996 was just
over 7 months; the median was nearly 5 months (table 4.11).  

* Cases decided by juries had a mean elapsed time from arrest to
sentencing of nearly 12 months; those disposed by bench trial
had a mean of just over 6« months; those disposed by guilty plea
had a mean of nearly 8 months (table 4.11).

Juveniles transferred to adult court, 
1996

Defendants are prosecuted in either juvenile courts or  adult
courts.  The defendant's age largely determines which of the
two.  In 1996, all defendants 16 years of age and older in three 
States -- Connecticut, New York, and North Carolina -- were 
prosecuted in adult courts.  All those age 17 or older were 
prosecuted in adult courts in 10 States: Georgia, Illinois, 
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, 
Texas, South Carolina, and Wisconsin. In the remaining 37 States, 
prosecution was in adult courts for all defendants age 18 or older.

In exceptional cases, defendants below these ages were also
prosecuted in adult courts.  Such cases were either  statutorily
excluded from juvenile court jurisdiction or waived to adult
court at the discretion of authorities (juvenile courts or
prosecutors).  Commonly excluded cases are murders and other
serious violent offenses.  In addition, several States exclude
juveniles charged with felonies if they have prior adjudications
or convictions.

Juvenile defendants prosecuted in adult courts are referred to
as transferred cases.  As the term is used here, transferred
covers both cases excluded from juvenile court by statute and
cases transferred to adult court at the discretion of the
juvenile court or the prosecutor.

In this chapter, transferred juveniles are compared to adult
felony defendants.  The sample of transferred juveniles used in
the comparison is large although not statistically
representative of all transferred juveniles.  

Compared to adult felony defendants, transferred 
juvenile felony defendants were --

More likely 
*  to be male than female: 96% versus 84% (table 5.1)
*  to be black* than white*(Note:*Includes Hispanics.): 
55% versus 45% (table 5.1)
*  to have a violent offense as their conviction offense: 
53% versus 17% (table 5.1)
*  to have robbery as their conviction offense: 23% 
versus 4%  (table 5.1)

Less likely
*  to have a drug offense as their 
conviction offense: 11% versus 37% (table 5.1)

 

Among defendants convicted of the following offenses,
transferred juveniles were --

More likely to be sentenced to 
prison
*  burglary: 50% versus 20% (table 5.2)
*  larceny:37%versus 17% (table 5.2)
*  weapons offenses: 55% versus 39% (table 5.2)

More likely to be sentenced to 
longer prison terms
*  weapons offenses: 48 months versus 42 months (table 5.3)

Less likely to be sentenced to 
probation
*  property offenses: 27% versus 54% (table 5.2)
*  larceny: 21% versus 51% (table 5.5)

Less likely to be sentenced to 
longer prison terms
* sexual assault: 105 months versus 117 months (table 5.3)
* burglary: 41 months versus 57 months (table 5.3)
* drug offenses: 30 versus 47 months (table 5.3)

Less likely to be sentenced to 
longer probation terms
* drug trafficking: 27 months versus 42 months (table 5.3)
* weapons offenses: 26 months versus 31 months (table 5.3)

Trends in incarceration and sentence length
in State courts

Trends in the United State:
1988 to 1996

Number of convictions increasing

State courts convicted 997,970 adults of a felony in 
1996.  That total is 50% greater than the number convicted 
in 1988.  The general trend has been upward since 1988.

              Number of felony
       convictions
1988        667,366
1990        829,344
1992        893,630
1994        872,217
1996        997,970

Increasing likelihood of arrest leading 
to conviction  

The likelihood of a felony arrest leading to a felony
conviction is approximated by dividing the number of adult
felony convictions in a year by the number of adult felony
arrests that year.  In 1996, for example, robbery convictions
totaled 42,831, and robbery arrests totaled 106,178, 
indicating a likelihood of conviction of about 40% for robbery.

Approximate likelihood of felony arrest
leading to felony conviction
                        1988    1992   1996
Murder                   48%     65%    71%
Robbery                  32      41     40
Aggravated  
assault                  10      14     16
Burglary                 33      41     41
Drug trafficking         39      55     66
 
Although the Nation's annual arrest statistics do not
distinguish felony from misdemeanor arrests, this method for
estimating the likelihood of conviction from aggregate
statistics is still valid for certain crimes -- such as robbery
-- that are always or nearly always defined in State law as
felonies.

Since 1988 the likelihood of an arrest leading to a conviction
has generally risen for all crimes.

Rising case processing time  

Cases took longer for courts to process in 1996 than in 1988. 
The average length of time from arrest to sentencing was 219
days in 1996, or 11 days longer than in 1988.

Guilty pleas unchanged

An indirect measure of how well courts keep pace with a growing
workload is the percentage of cases disposed by guilty plea. 
Since guilty pleas take less time than trials, a rising workload
might exert pressure on prosecutors and judges to dispose of
more cases by plea rather than trial.  While that would help
courts to keep pace, a check of the data did not uncover
evidence of more guilty pleas.  In 1988 guilty pleas accounted
for 91% of all felony convictions, and trials accounted for the
remaining 9%.  Corresponding figures for 1996 were the same (91%
guilty pleas and 9% trials).  Since 1988 guilty pleas have
remained at about 90% of felony convictions.

Aging of convicted felons  

The average age of the American population is rising, a trend
reflected in the changing ages of convicted felons.  In 1988,
persons age 30 or older comprised 73% of adults (age 18 and
older) in the U.S. population and accounted for 40% of persons
convicted; in 1996 persons age 30 or older accounted for 78%
of adults (age 18 or older) in the U.S. population and 50% of
persons convicted.  The median age of convicted felons was 27
years in 1988 but 30 years in 1996.  

Changing racial composition of 
convicted felons

Persons whose racial background is not white comprise a growing
fraction of both the U.S. population and convicted felons.  In
1988 blacks, American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians, and
Pacific Islanders together were 14% of persons age 18 or older
and 43% of persons convicted of a felony.  In 1996 those same
racial groups accounted for 16% of U.S. adults and 42% of those
convicted.

Prison sentences less likely  

From 1988 to 1994 the percentage of felons receiving a State prison 
sentence stayed at around 45%.  But in 1996 that percentage fell to 
38%.  The drop in prison sentences was accompanied by an increase in 
the percentage receiving other types of sentences, particularly
sentences to local jails.  From 1988 to 1994 jail sentences made
up around 25% of all felony sentences.  In 1996, the percentage 
receiving a jail sentence rose to 31%.

Imposed prison sentences getting shorter but inmates 
are serving a growing fraction of their sentence before 
being released

Prior to being freed, inmates released from State prison in 1988
had served, on average, a third of the sentence imposed on them
by the court.  In 1996 inmates were released after serving
approximately half of their court-imposed sentence.  While
prisoners are serving a growing percentage of their court-
imposed sentence, the average court-imposed sentence has
been decreasing.  In 1988 the typical felon received a 6-year
sentence and (assuming a person sentenced in 1988 will serve the
same fraction of his/her sentence as was typical among persons
released in 1988) would serve a third  of that sentence before
being released, or 2 years.  By contrast, in 1996 the typical
felon received a 5-year sentence but (assuming a person
sentenced in 1996 will serve the same fraction of his/her
sentence as was typical among persons released in 1996) would
serve half of that  before being released, or 2« years.

Comparing measures

How trends were verified

Two notable trends documented in this report are 1) the decline
in the percentage of felons receiving a prison sentence and 2)
the decline in the length of prison sentences imposed.
These changes may have been due to the 1996 NJRP sample
redesign, which introduced courts that had not been surveyed in
1994.  To determine if the altered composition of the sample had
produced the reported changes, comparisons were made between
courts surveyed for the NJRP in both years and between the NJRP
and findings from other statistical series. In each case the
trend was confirmed.

Decline in the percentage of felons 
receiving a prison sentence

In 1994, 45% of convicted felons received a prison sentence,
decreasing to 38% in 1996.  To determine if felons were actually
less likely to go to prison in 1996 than 2 years earlier, as
reported on pages iii and 50, three comparisons were made:

* Between 1994 and 1996 for the 98 courts that were in both NJRP
samples

* Between the NJRP findings in this report and the findings of
the State Court Processing Statistics program

* Between the NJRP findings and the findings of the National
Prisoner Statistics program.

The seven percentage point drop between 1994 and 1996 remained 
when the samples of the 2 years contained only courts that
appeared in both samples.  Apparently the change in the sample
was not responsible for the finding that convicted defendants 
nationwide were less likely in 1996 than before to go to prison. 

The statistical series State Court Processing 
Statistics reports on a survey of court records 
from the 75 largest counties. Data from this survey also 
show a recent decline (figure 1).

The statistical series National Prisoner Statistics 
reports the number of new admissions to prison from 
State courts.  Both prison records and court records 
indicate no general upward trend in the number of
sentences to prison (figure 2).

Decline in the length of the 
average prison sentence

To check the decline in the average length of the imposed
sentence to prison, reported on pages iii and 51, NJRP 
findings were compared with those from the statistical 
series National Corrections Reporting Program. According 
to prison records, the average length of imposed prison 
sentences has declined, just as court records indicated 
(figure 3).

Methodology

Sampling

The survey used a two-stage, stratified cluster sampling design.
In the first stage the Nation's 3,195 counties or county
equivalents were divided into 14 strata.  Strata 0, 11, 12, 31,
51, and 52 consisted solely of the 75 largest counties in the
United States as defined by the 1995 resident population. 
Strata 111, 112, 113, 311, 312, 511, 512, and 513 consisted of
the remaining 3,120 counties.

Because the 75 largest counties account for a disproportionately
large amount of serious crime in the Nation, they were given a
greater chance of being selected than the remaining counties.
The 75 largest counties were placed into 6 strata defined by how
their State submitted their 1994 NJRP data (electronically or
centrally, electronically but required manual processing time,
manually collected through site visits or not centrally) and by
the 1995 population of the county.

Stratum 0 consisted of the 19 counties with the largest
population in 1995.  Every county in stratum 0 was selected for
the sample. 

Altogether, 45 out of the 75 largest counties were sampled. 
Thirty-two of the 45 sampled counties in the 1996 NJRP survey
were also included in the 1994 survey.  The 3,120 counties not
among the 75 largest were placed into 8 strata defined (similar
to the largest 75 counties) by how their 1994 NJRP data were
submitted and by their 1995 population.

The final sample thus included 344 counties from among the 3,120
counties outside the 75 largest.  None of the counties refused
to participate.  Case-level data were successfully obtained on
convicted felons sentenced in 1996 from these 344 counties.
(Three of the 344 had no felony convictions during the survey 
period.) 

The 19 sampled counties in stratum 0 were self-representing
only, and their sampled cases therefore had a first-stage
sampling weight of 1.  The remaining 325 counties sampled from
the remaining strata were selected to represent their respective
strata so that the felony conviction cases sampled had
first-stage weights greater than 1.

At the second stage of sampling, a systematic sample of felons
sentenced for murder/nonnegligent manslaughter, sexual assaults,
robbery aggravated assault, burglary, felony larceny/motor
vehicle theft, fraud/forgery/embezzlement, drug trafficking,
drug possession, weapons offenses, and other offenses was
selected from each county's official records.  The total sample
numbered 414,969 cases.  Of these, 270,104 cases were in the 75
largest counties.

Rates at which cases were sampled varied by how the data were
submitted, by stratum and by crime type.  In larger counties all
murder cases and rape cases were typically included, but other
offense categories were sampled.

Sampling error

NJRP data were obtained from a sample and not from a complete
enumeration; consequently, they are subject to sampling error. 
A standard error, which is a measure of sampling error, is
associated with each number in the report.  In general, if the
difference between two numbers is at least twice the standard
error of that difference (the criterion used in this report),
there is at least 95% confidence that the two numbers do in fact
differ; that is, the apparent difference is not simply the
result of surveying a sample rather than the entire population.  

National estimates of the number of convictions for individual
crime categories and for the aggregate total had a coefficient
of variation of 3.7%.  

Missing data

Unless otherwise stated, computations of statistics shown in the
report's tables excluded sample cases that were missing data for
the particular variables being tabulated.

Hispanic origin

This report does not analyze Hispanics as a separate category. 
Hispanic origin is rarely recorded in court records that the
NJRP is based on.

Sources of data

State courts were the source of NJRP data for about 73% of the
344 counties sampled.  For other counties, sources included
statistical agencies, sentencing commissions, department of
public safety, probation departments, State police departments,
and department of corrections.  Individual-level NJRP records 
were obtained through a variety of collection methods, including
electronically (86% of the counties) and manually (14%).

Electronic methods of data submission included:  diskette,
magnetic tape, and transmission over the Internet.  Manual
methods included photocopies of official documents, survey
questionnaires completed by court officials, and on-site
collections by Census Bureau staff.

All data were collected by the U.S. 
Bureau of the Census.

Targeted population

The survey targeted and recorded initial sentences imposed in
1996.  If a sentence was imposed on one date and then modified 
at a later date, the revision was ignored. The survey recorded 
sentences that were actually executed and excluded suspended 
sentences.

Because the year of conviction was not a defining characteristic, 
some cases in the sample were of persons convicted before 1996 
but not sentenced until 1996.

In a few counties where it was impractical to target sentences
in 1996, the target was felons convicted in 1996.  Hence, in
some of the cases the data pertain to sentences imposed after
1996.

Crime definitions

Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter: Murder is (1)
intentionally causing the death of another person without
extreme provocation or legal justification or (2) causing the
death of another while committing or attempting to commit
another crime.  Nonnegligent (or voluntary) manslaughter is
intentionally and without legal justification causing the death
of another when acting under extreme provocation.  The combined
category of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter excludes
involuntary or negligent manslaughter, conspiracies to commit
murder, solicitation of murder, and attempted murder.

Rape/Sexual assault:  Rape includes forcible intercourse
(vaginal, anal, or oral) with a female or male.  Includes
forcible sodomy or penetration with a foreign object (sometimes
called "deviate sexual assault"); excludes statutory rape or any
other nonforcible sexual acts with a minor or with someone
unable to give legal or factual consent.  Includes attempts.
Other sexual assault  includes (1) forcible or violent sexual
acts not involving intercourse with an adult or minor, (2)
nonforcible sexual acts with a minor (such as statutory rape or
incest with a minor), and (3) nonforcible sexual acts with
someone unable to give legal or factual consent because of
mental or physical defect or intoxication.  Includes attempts.

Robbery:  the unlawful taking of property that is in the
immediate possession of another, by force or the threat of
force.  Includes forcible purse snatching, but excludes
nonforcible purse snatching, which is classified as
larceny/theft.  Includes attempts. 

Aggravated assault:  (1) intentionally and without legal
justification causing serious bodily injury, with or without a
deadly weapon or (2) using a deadly or dangerous weapon to 
threaten, attempt, or cause bodily injury, regardless of the 
degree of injury, if any.  Includes attempted murder, aggravated 
battery, felonious assault, and assault with a deadly weapon.

Other violent:  violent offenses excluded are murder and
nonnegligent manslaughter, rape and sexual assault, robbery, 
and aggravated assault.  Includes offenses such as kidnaping,
extortion, and negligent manslaughter.  Includes attempts.

regular residence, industry, or business, with or without the
use of force, to commit a felony or theft.  Includes attempts. 

Larceny:  the unlawful taking of property other than a motor
vehicle from the possession of another, by stealth, without
force or deceit.  Includes pocketpicking, nonforcible purse
snatching, shoplifting, and thefts from motor vehicles. 
Excludes receiving and/or reselling stolen property (fencing),
and thefts through fraud or deceit.  Includes attempts.

Motor vehicle theft:  the unlawful taking of a self-propelled
road vehicle owned by another.  Includes the theft of
auto-mobiles, trucks, and motorcycles, but not the theft of

fraud, confidence game, counterfeiting, and credit card fraud. 
Includes attempts.

Drug trafficking:  includes manufacturing, distributing,
selling, smuggling, and possession with intent to sell. Includes
attempts.

Drug possession:  includes possession of an illegal drug, but
excludes possession with intent to sell.  Includes attempts.

receiving stolen property, driving while intoxicated or other
traffic offenses, bribery, obstructing justice, escaping from
custody, family offenses (such as child neglect, contributing to
the delinquency of a minor, nonpayment of child support), and
nonviolent sexual offenses (such as incest, pornography
offenses, pimping, prostitution).  Includes attempts.

NJRP data consistent with other 
national data

Chapter VI, Trends in incarceration and sentence length in State
Courts, compares trends in sentencing based on NJRP data and 
trends based on other sources of national data.  Results indi-
cate a close correspondence between alternative sources of data.
