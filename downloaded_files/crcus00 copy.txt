In 2000 plaintiffs filed over 259,000 civil 
complaints in U.S. district courts.  About 
41,000 of these complaints involved a civil
rights-related issue such as discrimination 
in employment, housing, welfare benefits, or
voting rights.  The number of civil rights-
related cases declined to 40,908 after reaching 
a high of 43,278 in 1997.

The decline in the number of civil rights 
complaints was due largely to employment civil 
rights complaints that dropped 12% from 23,796 
in 1997 to 21,032 in 2000.  By contrast, the 
number of other types of civil rights complaints 
increased from 1998 to 2000: housing from 838 to
1,284, voting from 108 to 167, and welfare from 
66 to 80 filings.

In 2000 a jury disposed of 80% of the 1,652 civil 
rights complaints terminated by trial verdict; a 
judge, 17%; and a directed verdict, about 4%. This
continues the upward trend in the use of jury trials 
over the decade.  On average, civil rights related 
complaints went from filing to disposition by trial 
verdict in about 14 months during 2000.  Half the 
complaints were disposed of in 11 months or less.

The number of civil rights related complaints filed 
in U.S. courts of appeal fell to 7,952 in 2000 from
a high of 8,466 in 1998.  Civil rights related appeals 
accounted for about 22% of all civil cases filed in 
U.S. courts of appeal.

Jurisdiction of civil rights complaints

Most (90%) civil rights complaints filed in U.S. 
district court continued to involve only private 
parties rather than the Federal Government.  Private
suits, however, declined 6% from a high of 40,361 
in 1997 to 37,888 in 2000, while employment complaints 
in which the U.S. Government was the defendant rose 
8% from 1,241 in 1997 to 1,362 in 2000. 

These statistics, prepared by Marika F.X. Litras,
 Ph.D., update those in previous reports.  Visit

Continued increase in out-of-court settlements

While out-of-court settlements rose from 35% of 
civil rights complaints disposed of in 1998
to 38% in 2000, trial verdicts continued a decline 
from 5% to 4%. 

Plaintiff winners and awards

Plaintiffs won 34% of civil rights complaints in 
2000 regardless of the type of trial.  Of the 545
plaintiffs who won their trials, 416 or 76% were 
awarded monetary damages.  Half of these awards 
were in amounts of $155,500 or less.
