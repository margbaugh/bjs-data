Jail Inmates at Midyear 2012 -
Statistical Tables

May 2013, NCJ 241264
************************************************************

After three consecutive years of decline in the jail inmate 
population, the number of persons confined in county and 
city jails (744,524) increased by 1.2% (or 8,923 inmates)
between midyear 2011 and midyear 2012 (figure 1, table 1). 
The majority of the increase occurred in California jails. 
Excluding the increase in California’s jail population, the 
nationwide jail population would have remained relatively 
stable during the period. (For more information on 
California, see the text box on page 2.)

The average daily population (ADP) in jails remained stable 
from 735,565 during the 12-month period ending June 30, 
2011, and 735,983 during the 12-month period ending June 30, 
2012. The jail incarceration rate--the confined population 
per 100,000 U.S. residents--remained stable between 2011 
(236 per 100,000) and 2012 (237 per 100,000). The 
incarceration rate was down from a high of 259 jail inmates 
per 100,000 residents in 2007.

Overall, males accounted for 87% of the jail population at 
midyear 2012 (tables 2 and 3). Whites accounted for 46% of 
the total, blacks represented 37%, and Hispanics represented 
15% of inmates. About 5,400 juveniles were held in local 
jails (or less than 1% of the confined population). At 
midyear 2012, about 6 in 10 inmates were not convicted,
but were in jail awaiting court action on a current
charge—a rate unchanged since 2005. About 4 in 10 inmates 
were sentenced offenders or convicted offenders awaiting 
sentencing.

*************************************************
The majority of the increase in the jail inmate
population occurred in large jails 
*************************************************

Nearly 91% of the increase in the confined population during 
2012 occurred in the largest jail jurisdictions-- those with 
an average daily population of more than 1,000 inmates 
(table 4). The largest jails held 48% of the jail population 
at midyear 2012, but accounted for less than 10% of all jail 
jurisdictions nationwide. The population declined in jail 
jurisdictions holding 500 to 999 inmates. The share of 
offenders in jail jurisdictions holding less than 500 
inmates did not change significantly between 2011 and 2012,
indicating that these jail jurisdictions had somewhat
similar rates of increase in their population.

**************************************
California Public Safety Realignment
**************************************

On May 23, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ruling
by a lower three-judge court that the State of California
must reduce its prison population to 137.5% of design
capacity (approximately 110,000 prisoners) within two
years to alleviate overcrowding. In response, the California
State Legislature and governor enacted two laws--AB 109
and AB 117—to reduce the number of inmates housed in
state prisons starting October 1, 2011.

The Public Safety Realignment (PSR) policy is designed
to reduce the prison population through normal attrition
of the existing population while placing new nonviolent,
nonserious, nonsex offenders under county jurisdiction for
incarceration in local jail facilities. Inmates released 
from local jails will be placed under a county-directed 
postrelease community supervision program instead of the
state’s parole system. The state is giving additional 
funding to the 58 counties in California to deal with the 
increased correctional population and responsibility; 
however, each county must develop a plan for custody and 
post-custody that best serves the needs of the county.

After record low jail populations between yearend 2010
and yearend 2011, the California jail population increased
in 2012 by an estimated 7,600 inmates since yearend 2011
(figure 2).

The Bureau of Justice Statistics will continue to analyze
population characteristics in California’s jails and 
describe how these jails affect the nationwide jail 
population.

********************************************************

Increase in new bed space between 2011 and 2012 was 
nearly a third of the average annual increase since
2000, while the percentage of capacity occupied held
Steady
********************************************************

Rated capacity in jails reached 886,947 beds at midyear
2012, an increase of 0.8% (7,225 beds) from 879,722 beds in
midyear 2011 (figure 3, table 5). The increase between 2011
and 2012 was about a third of the average annual increase
each year between 2000 and 2011 (2.4% or 20,942 beds).
Rated capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates
allocated to each jail facility by a state or local rating 
official.

The percentage of rated capacity occupied at midyear 2012
(84%) was the lowest since 1984 (86%). Jail jurisdictions
holding 1,000 or more inmates reported the highest
percentage of occupied bed space at midyear 2011 (88%) and
2012 (89%), compared to jails holding fewer than 50 inmates
at midyear 2011 and 2012 (66% in each years) (table 6).

In addition to measuring the rated capacity occupied based
on the inmate count at midyear, the measurement can be
based on an ADP in jail jurisdictions during the 12-month
period ending June 30, 2012, and by the number of inmates
on the most crowded day in jails during June 2012. Using
these two measures, the nation’s jails operated at about 83%
of rated capacity on an average day and about 90% of rated
capacity on their most crowded day in June 2012.

While the confined population and rated jail capacity both
increased at roughly comparable rates from 2000 through
2008, the growth rates have diverged since 2008. The
confined population declined by about 1.3% on average
per year, while rated capacity increased by about 1.7% on
average per year. The increase in capacity and decrease
in confined population almost equally contributed to the
decline in the percentage of capacity occupied, from 95% in
2008 to 84% in 2012.

Jail jurisdictions holding between 100 and 249 inmates
experienced the largest difference in change rates between
rated capacity and the jail inmate population (figure 4).
From midyear 2008 to 2012, these jail jurisdictions reported
a 2.8% decline in their inmate custody population and a
21.6% increase in their rated capacity. The smallest jail
jurisdictions, which held fewer than 50 inmates, reported
the smallest difference between change in their inmate
population (down 1.1%) and change in rated capacity
(up 6.4%). With the exception of an increase in the inmate
population for jail jurisdictions holding 50 to 99 inmates, 
all other jail jurisdictions experienced a decline in their 
midyear jail population and an increase in their rated 
capacity.

**********************************************
Local jails admitted 11.6 million persons 
during the 12-month period ending midyear 2012
***********************************************

Local jails admitted an estimated 11.6 million persons 
during the 12-month period ending June 30, 2012, which was 
similar to 2011 (11.8 million) and down from 13.6 million in 
2008. The number of persons admitted in 2012 was about 16 
times the size of the ADP (735,983) during the 12-month 
period between July 1, 2011 and June 30, 2012. (See 
Methodology for methods used to estimate admissions.)

Nearly 4 in 10 admissions during the last week of June
2012 were to the largest jail jurisdictions (table 7). Jail
jurisdictions holding fewer than 50 inmates accounted for
7.2% of all jail admissions. The number of inmates admitted
was about 35 times the size of the ADP between 2011 and
2012. These small jail jurisdictions also experienced the
highest turnover rate (131%). The turnover rate in large 
jail jurisdictions was 50%. Higher turnover rates mean 
larger numbers of admissions and releases relative to the 
size of the average daily population.

Methodology

Annual Survey of Jails
-----------------------

In years between the complete census of local jails, the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducts the Annual
Survey of Jails (ASJ). ASJ uses a sample of jail 
jurisdictions to estimate the number and characteristics of 
local inmates nationwide. For the 2012 ASJ, the U.S. Census 
Bureau, as the collection agent, drew a sample of 874 jail 
jurisdictions represented by 929 jail facilities (referred 
to as reporting units). This sample represents about 2,800 
jail jurisdictions nationwide. Local jail jurisdictions 
include counties (parishes in Louisiana) or municipal 
governments that administer one or more local jails.

The 2012 ASJ sample included all jails with certainty (67)
that were operated jointly by two or more jurisdictions
(also referred to as multi-jurisdictional jails). Other jail
jurisdictions included with certainty (268) were those that-
-
??
* held juvenile inmates at the time of the 2005 Census of
Jail Inmates and had an average daily population (ADP)
of 500 or more inmates during the 12 months ending June
30, 2005

* held only adult inmates and had an ADP of 750 or more.

The remaining jurisdictions were stratified into two groups:
jurisdictions with jails holding at least one juvenile on
June 30, 2005, and jails holding only adults on that date.
Using stratified random sampling, 538 jurisdictions were
selected from eight strata based on the two conditions
described above, and from four strata based on the average
daily jail inmate population reported in the latest Census 
of Jail Inmates completed in 2005.

BJS obtained data from sampled jail jurisdictions by mailed
and web-based survey questionnaires. After follow-up phone
calls and facsimiles, the response rate for data reporters 
was nearly 100% for critical items, such as the number of 
inmates confined, ADP, and rated capacity. (See tables 10, 
11, and 12 for standard errors associated with reported 
estimates from the ASJ 2012.)

***************************************************
Response rate, nonresponse adjustment, and out-of 
Scope jail facilities
***************************************************

The 2012 ASJ sampling frame comprised 929 reporting
units. Ninety-four percent (or 861) of the 920 individual
reporting units responded to the 2012 data collection, and
59 individual reporting units did not respond to the 
survey.*** Footnote *The sampling frame initially comprised 
929 units. However, nine units were out-of-scope for the 
2012 data collection because they had closed, either 
permanently or temporarily, which resulted in the sampling 
frame of 920 active respondents***.

BJS imputed the data for six of these 59 non-responding
reporting units, as they belong to jurisdictions with at 
least one responding reporting unit (hence their 
jurisdiction is partial responder). For the remaining 53 
reporting units (that did not respond) BJS implemented 
nonresponse weights adjustment procedures.

Respondent indicators
-----------------------

The respondent reporting unit indicator JAILRhij is set for
each individual reporting unit j in jurisdiction i in 
stratum h on the file, based on the status of the individual 
reporting unit.

=
0 if nonrespondent, closed, or outofscope.
1 if respondent or using prior year data JAILRhij {
The respondent jurisdiction indicator JURISRhi is set
for each jurisdiction i in stratum h on the file, based on
the value of JAILRhij for the reporting units within the
jurisdiction.

{ 1 if
JURISRhi =
0 otherwise.
j=1
ni JAILRhij 1 

Active indicators
-------------------

The active reporting unit indicator JAILAhij is set for each
individual reporting unit j in jurisdiction i in stratum h 
on the file, based on the status of the individual reporting 
unit.

=
0 if closed, or outofscope.
{1 if respondent, using prior year data, or nonrespondent 
JAILAhij
The active jurisdiction indicator JURISAhi is set for each
jurisdiction i in stratum h on the file, based on the value 
of
JAILAhij for the reporting units within the jurisdiction.
JURISAhi = {
1 if
0 otherwise.
j=1
ni JAILAhij  

*****************************************
Nonresponse weighting adjustment factor
*****************************************

The nonresponse weighting adjustment factor is calculated
within each stratum. BJS uses the sample weights in the
nonresponse adjustment factor. The nonresponse weighting
adjustment factor F2h is calculated as

F2h =
JURISAhi i=1
nh Whi  ×
JURISRhi i=1
nh Whi  ×

where

nh = number of jurisdictions in stratum h,
whi = sample weight for jurisdiction i in stratum h.

*************
Final weight
*************

The final weight FWhi for each jail jurisdiction on the 2012
ASJ data file is calculated as

FWhi= F2h Whi JURISRhi × ×

Where

Whi= sample weight for jurisdiction i in
stratum h.

JURISRhi is used to set the final weight to 0 for units that 
are closed, out-of-scope, or nonrespondents.

***************************************************
Final weight post-stratification: California jail
jurisdictions and the Public Safety Realignment
***************************************************

Because of the California Public Safety Realignment,
between midyear 2011 and midyear 2012, California
jails experienced a significant increase in the number of
inmates (about 8,500 inmates) that was not experienced
by jails nationwide. Consequently, California jails do not
represent other jail jurisdictions nationwide. To ensure
that the sampled (both with certainty and non-certainty)
California jail jurisdictions represent California 
jurisdictions only, BJS computed new weights. Without 
computing new weights, the estimated nationwide jail 
population would be erroneously inflated. 

The post-stratification final weight adjustment is 
calculated for each stratum from which California 
jurisdictions were sampled. More specifically for each 
stratum, two new strata and set of weights are created: one 
for the California jurisdictions (PSCAh) and one for the 
non-California jurisdictions (PSCAh). The weights for those 
strata from which California jail jurisdictions were not 
sampled remain unchanged.

The post-stratification adjustment for California jail
jurisdictions is computed as

where 

NCAh = number of California jail jurisdictions in stratum h
(as determined from the 2005 Census of Jail Inmates),

nCAh = number of sampled California jail jurisdictions in
stratum h.
Note that there were a total of 10 California jail 
jurisdictions that belonged to two strata from which no 
California jail  jurisdictions were sampled. Those 10 jail 
jurisdictions were moved from their original strata and 
placed into the most similar stratum from which California 
jail jurisdictions were sampled.

The post-stratification adjustment for non-California
jurisdictions is computed as

PSCAh=
NCAh
JURISRCAhi

where

NCAh = number of non-California jurisdictions in stratum h,
computed as

nCAh = number of sampled non-California jail jurisdictions
in stratum h.

*****************************
Item nonresponse imputation
*****************************

Average daily population (ADP) and rated capacity
--------------------------------------------------

Based on the 2012 ASJ, over 99% of the 867 (including
estimates for six nonrespondents) individual reporting units
provided valid data on their ADP (860) and rated capacity
(862). To calculate a national ADP and rated capacity
estimate, data were estimated for the reporting units that 
did not report specific data.

Estimates were calculated based on the following criteria:

* Data for 7 individual reporting units included ADP data
based on estimates from the 2011 Annual Survey of Jails.

* Data for 2 individual reporting units included data based
on the design capacity reported in the 2012 Annual
Survey of Jails.

* Data for 3 individual reporting units included rated
capacity data based on estimates from the 2011 Annual
Survey of Jails.

Inmate characteristics
-----------------------

Based on the 2012 ASJ, about 98% of the 867 (including
estimates for six nonrespondents) individual reporting
units provided valid data on sex and age and race/Hispanic
origin. Nearly 91% of respondents provided data on inmate
conviction status. To calculate a national rate for inmate
characteristics, data were estimated based on the ratio of
the reported characteristic population to the total midyear
confined population.

Weekly admission and release estimation procedures
---------------------------------------------------

Based on the 2012 ASJ, 844 of the 867 (including estimates
for six nonrespondents) individual reporting units (97%)
provided valid data on weekly admissions or releases. To
calculate an overall weekly estimate, data on offender flows
through local jails were estimated for the 23 reporting 
units that did not report specific data on admissions and 
releases. Release data were estimated for 9 reporting units 
that reported data on admissions, but not on releases.

Estimates were calculated based on the following criteria:

* Data for 1 individual reporting unit included admission
and release data based on estimates from the 2007 ASJ.

* Data for 1 individual reporting unit included admission
and release data based on estimates from the 2009 ASJ.

* Data for 5 individual reporting units included admission
and release data based on estimates from the 2010 ASJ.

* Data for 16 individual reporting units included admission
and release data based on estimates from the 2011 ASJ.

* Release data for 9 individual reporting units were based
on admission data reported in 2012.

******************************
Calculating annual admissions
******************************

The ASJ collects data on weekly admissions. BJS determined
that the June admission data from the 2004 Survey of Large
Jails (SLJ) were a reliable source to calculate a nationwide
annual admission estimate. Although the number of
admissions to jails fluctuated throughout the year, the SLJ
tracked monthly movements from January 2003 to January
2004 and showed that the June 2003 count (339,500)
closely matched the annual average number of admissions
(342,956). The number of annual admissions was calculated
by multiplying the weekly admissions by 366 days and
dividing by 7 days.

***********************************
Calculating weekly turnover rates
***********************************

Weekly jail turnover rates were modeled after the Bureau of
Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.
Additional information on turnover rates is available at
http://www.bls.gov/jlt/. Jail turnover rates were calculated
by adding admissions and releases, and then dividing by the
ADP. The turnover rate takes into account jail admissions
and releases and gives an indication of the fluctuation of 
the jail population.

******************************
Jurisdiction size categories
******************************

For the 2011 and 2012 reports, BJS categorized jurisdiction
sizes, based on the average daily jail population during the
12 months ending midyear 2006 (which was the first year
in the current ASJ series). For the 2010 report, comparisons
of size categories from midyear 2009 to midyear 2010 were
based on the ADP during the 12 months ending midyear
2009. In previous reports (2007 through 2009), the size
category comparisons were based on the 12 months ending
midyear of the specific collection year. As a result, not 
all data in previous reports are comparable with data in 
this report.

***********************************
Estimating California’s midyear 
jail population
***********************************

The ASJ is a sample survey, and data are not representative
of individual states. Data from about 70% of California’s 
jail jurisdictions are included in the 2006-2012 Annual 
Survey of Jails. Based on yearend data of California’s jail 
population collected through BJS’s Deaths in Custody 
Reporting Program, 70% of California’s jail jurisdictions 
included in ASJ accounted for about 97.5% of all 
California’s jail population in any given year from 2005 to 
2011.

To calculate a midyear jail population, BJS applied the
proportion of the latest yearend non-ASJ sample of
California’s jail population to the midyear inmate 
population in the ASJ sample for that year.

For example:

ASJ sample of California’s jail population at midyear 2012 =
76,667

Proportion of the latest non-ASJ sample of California jail
population at yearend 2011 = 2.5868%

(76,667 * .025868) + (76,667)= 78,650 estimated midyear jail
Population

*****************
Jail functions
*****************

Jails in the ASJ include confinement facilities—usually
administered by a local law enforcement agency—that are
intended for adults but may hold juveniles before or after
adjudication. Facilities include jails and city or county
correctional centers; special jail facilities, such as 
medical or treatment release centers, halfway houses, and 
work farms; and temporary holding or lockup facilities that 
are part of the jail’s combined function. Inmates sentenced 
to jail facilities usually have a sentence of 1 year or 
less. Within the ASJ, jails--

* receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them
awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing

* re-admit probation, parole, and bail bond violators and
Absconders

* temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to juvenile
authorities

* hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to
appropriate mental health facilities

* hold individuals for the military, for protective custody,
for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses

* release convicted inmates to the community upon
completion of sentence

* transfer inmates to federal, state, or other authorities

* house inmates for federal, state, or other authorities
because of crowding of their facilities

* sometimes operate community-based programs as
alternatives to incarceration.

*****************************************
Terms and definitions used in the report
*****************************************

Admissions--Persons are officially booked and housed
in jails by formal legal document and the authority of the
courts or some other official agency. Jail admissions 
include persons sentenced to weekend programs and who are
booked into the facility for the first time. Excluded from
jail admissions are inmates re-entering the facility after 
an escape, work release, medical appointment or treatment
facility appointment, and bail and court appearances. BJS
collects jail admissions for the last 7 days in June.

Average daily population--The average is derived by the
sum of inmates in jail each day for a year, divided by the
number of days in the year (i.e., between July 1, 2011, and
June 30, 2012).

Average annual change--The mean average change across a
12-month time period.

Calculating annual admissions--BJS collects the number
of jail admissions during the last 7 days in June. Annual 
jail admissions are calculated by multiplying weekly 
admissions by the sum of 366 days divided by 7 days.

Calculating weekly jail turnover rate--This rate is
calculated by adding admissions and releases and dividing
by the average daily population. See Calculating weekly
turnover rates for additional information.

Inmates confined at midyear--The number of inmates held
in custody on the last weekday in June.

Jail incarceration rate--The number of inmates held in the
custody of local jails, per 100,000 U.S. residents.

Percent of capacity occupied--This percentage is calculated
by taking the number of inmates at midyear, dividing by the
rated capacity, and multiplying by 100.

Rated capacity--The number of beds or inmates assigned
by a rating official to a facility, excluding separate 
temporary holding areas.

Releases--Persons released after a period of confinement
(e.g., sentence completion, bail or bond releases, other
pretrial releases, transfers to other jurisdictions, and 
deaths). Releases include those persons who have completed 
their weekend program and who are leaving the facility for 
the last time. Excluded from jail releases are temporary 
discharges including work release, medical appointment or 
treatment center, court appearance, furlough, day reporting, 
and transfers to other facilities within the jail’s 
jurisdiction.

Under jail supervision but not confined--This
classification includes all persons in community-based
programs operated by a jail facility. Programs include
electronic monitoring, house arrest, community service, day
reporting, and work programs. The classification excludes
persons on pretrial release and who are not in a 
communitybased program run by the jail, as well as persons 
under supervision of probation, parole or other agencies, 
inmates on weekend programs, and inmates who participate in 
work release programs and return to the jail at night.

Weekend programs--Offenders in these programs are
allowed to serve their sentences of confinement only on
weekends (i.e., Friday to Sunday).
