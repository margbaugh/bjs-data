Foreword

This publication represents the annual report 
to the Congress as required by Section 210402 
of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement 
Act of 1994.  The findings are based upon the 
largest self-report survey ever conducted among 
the U.S. resident population about contacts 
between the public and the police and the 
outcomes of those contacts.  The objective of 
the survey was to learn more about how often 
and under what circumstances a traffic stop or 
other contact becomes problematic.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) initiated 
surveys of the public on their interactions with 
police in 1996 with the first Police-Public Contact 
Survey, a pretest among a nationally representative 
sample of 6,421 persons aged 12 or older.  That 
initial version of the questionnaire revealed that 
about 20% of the public had a direct, face-to-face 
contact with a police officer at least once during 
the year preceding the survey.  At that time, BJS 
estimated that about 1 in 500 residents, or about 
a half million people, had experienced an encounter 
with a police officer involving either a threat of 
force or the actual use of force.

An improved version of the Police-Public Contact 
Survey (PPCS II) was fielded during the last 6 
months of 1999 among a national sample nearly 
15 times as large as the pretest sample in 1996.  
It yielded nearly identical estimates of the 
prevalence and nature of contacts between the 
public and the police.  The most recent survey, 
which obtained data from those age 16 or older, 
resulted in a finding that about 21% of the 
public had a direct, face-to-face contact at 
least once with a police officer during the 
year.  As in 1996, the 1999 survey revealed 
that during the year about 1 in 500 persons, 
or about 422,000 persons age 16 or older, 
experienced a contact with a  police officer 
which involved force or the threat that force 
would be used.  

The PPCS II, because of its much larger 
sample size, permitted more extensive analysis 
of demographic differences in police contacts.  
In addition, the PPCS II added a new and more 
detailed set of questions about traffic stops 
by police, the most frequent reason given for 
a contact with police.  Among licensed drivers, 
an estimated 10% of white drivers, 12% of black 
drivers, and 9% of Hispanic drivers were stopped 
by police at least once in 1999.  

Overall, most drivers who experienced a traffic 
stop indicated that they felt the officer had a 
legitimate reason for making the stop:  nearly 9 
out of 10 white drivers and 3 out of 4 black 
drivers described the officer as having had a 
legitimate reason for the stop.  Respondents 
maintained these perceptions regardless of the 
race of the officer making the stop.  White 
drivers' assessments of the legitimacy of the 
stop were the same whether the officer making 
the stop was white or black.  Similarly, black 
drivers ascribed the same level of legitimacy 
to stops by white officers and stops made by 
black officers.  

The PPCS provides a new opportunity to learn 
more about police and citizen contacts.  It 
is reassuring to find that most people, of 
any race, who have a contact with the police, 
most often through a traffic stop, evaluate 
the stop as having been appropriate.  Given 
the high level of attention and interest in 
police-citizen interactions, BJS expects to 
continue to collect such data from the public 
and to supplement this information with new 
data to be gathered from administrative 
records of law enforcement agencies and those 
other public agencies which are primarily 
responsible for receiving and adjudicating 
complaints arising from police/citizen 
encounters.

BJS is grateful for the assistance of the many 
people who offered their advice and counsel in 
the construction of the PPCS II questionnaire, 
the Census Bureau which fielded the survey, 
and those persons who willingly gave of their 
time as respondents to participate in this 
important national effort.

Highlights

Prevalence of citizen contact 
with police

*  In 1999 an estimated 43.8 million persons 
age 16 or older, about 21% of all persons of 
this age, had at least one face-to-face contact 
with a police officer.  This is approximately 
the same rate of contact between police and
citizens found in 1996 when the Police-Public 
Contact Survey (PPCS) was first administered.  

*  On a per capita basis in 1999, the rate 
of police-citizen contact for whites was about 
17% higher than for blacks and about 32% higher 
than for Hispanics.  The rate of contact for 
males was about 20% higher than for females 
and rates of contact varied inversely with age: 
those age 18 to 19 experienced a rate of contact 
160% above that of those age 50 or older.

*  About two-thirds of all persons 
experiencing a contact with police 
during 1999 had one contact for a 
single reason.  The remaining third 
of those with contacts had either
multiple contacts or multiple reasons 
for a single contact. 

Reasons for citizen contact 
with police

*  About half of all persons experiencing 
a contact with police indicated that the 
reason for the contact was a motor vehicle 
stop. Being either a passenger or an operator 
of a motor vehicle was the most common reason 
given for a contact with police. 
 
*  About 1 in 5 persons with a face-to-face 
contact with a police officer said that they 
had contacted the police to report a crime. 
 
*  About 3% of all respondents with a contact 
said the contact occurred because the police 
suspected them of involvement in a crime.

*  On a per capita basis, as passengers or 
drivers, whites experienced a rate of contact 
for traffic stops 6% above the rate estimated 
for black respondents and 26% above that for
Hispanics. 
 
*  In 1999 an estimated 113 whites per 1,000 
whites in the resident population experienced 
at least one traffic stop as a driver or passenger. 
The comparable rate among black residents was 
107, and among Hispanics, 90.

*  Persons age 18 to 19 had a per capita rate 
of contact arising from a motor vehicle stop 
of 225 per 1,000, more than 4 times the rate 
of traffic stops experienced by those age 50 
or older.

*  The percentage of the 43.8 million 
residents with a police contact in 1999:
Motor vehicle stop               52% 
Report a crime                   19
Ask for assistance               12
Report a neighborhood problem     9
Involved in traffic accident      8
Witness to a traffic accident     5
Witness to a crime                3
Questioned as crime suspect       3
Attend crime prevention meeting   1
Served warrant                    1

Citizen contacts with police 
in traffic stops

*  In 1999 an estimated 10.3% of licensed 
drivers were pulled over by police one or 
more times in a traffic stop.  The 10.3% 
represent 19.3 million stopped drivers.  
The 19.3 million includes 4 million pulled 
over more than once during the year.  An 
estimated 2.1% of all licensed drivers were
stopped two or more times.

*  Of the 19.3 million, an estimated 60.8% 
(11.7 million) were male and 39.2% 
(7.6 million) were female; 77% (14.9 million) 
were white, 11.6% (2.2 million) were black, 
8.4% (1.6 million) were Hispanic, and 3% 
(.6 million) were drivers of other races.

*  Males (12.5%) were more likely than females 
(8.2%) to be stopped at least once, and males 
(2.9%) were more likely than females (1.4%) to 
be stopped more than once.

*  Blacks (12.3%) were more likely than whites 
(10.4%) to be stopped at least once, and blacks 
(3.0%) were more likely than whites (2.1%) to 
be stopped more than once.  

*  Nearly twenty percent (18.2%) of teenage 
drivers were stopped at least once.

*  Of the 19.3 million stopped drivers, police 
issued a ticket to 54.2%, carried out a search 
of some kind (either a physical search of the 
driver or a search of the vehicle) on 6.6%, 
handcuffed 3.1%, arrested 3.0%, used or 
threatened force against 0.7%, and used or 
threatened force that the driver deemed 
excessive against 0.5%.

*  During the traffic stop, police were more 
likely to carry out some type of search on 
a male (9.4%) than a female (2.3%), and more 
likely on a black (11.0%) or Hispanic (11.3%) 
than a white (5.4%).

-----------------------------------
Force in the Police-Public 
Contact Survey

Force includes contacts in which the 
police officer pushed, grabbed, kicked, 
or hit the citizen.  Hitting was defined 
as striking with a hand or an object 
held in the officer's hand.  Included in 
the definition of force were police dog
bites, spray with pepper spray or a chemical, 
and a firearm pointed in the citizen's 
direction.  Also included was the
threat to carry out any of these types 
of force.

The survey provided an opportunity for 
respondents to express their opinion as 
to whether any police force or threat of 
force used against them was "excessive."  
The survey did not define "excessive" for 
the respondent. Respondents who said they 
had Police-Public Contact Survey experienced 
police use or threat of force were asked 
whether they felt any of the physical force 
used or threatened against them was excessive.  
If a respondent said the force was excessive, 
he or she was asked about the specific type 
of physical force considered excessive.
----------------------------------------

*  Police searched the driver or the vehicle 
of an estimated 1.3 million drivers (6.6% 
of all stopped drivers).  Two-thirds (66.4%) 
of the 1.3 million searches were without
the driver's expressed consent.  In nearly 
90% (86.7%) of the 1.3 million searches, no 
drugs, alcohol, illegal weapons, or other 
evidence of criminal wrongdoing was found. 
Searches conducted without the driver's 
consent (12.9%) were not more likely to 
find criminal evidence than consent 
searches (14.2%).

*  An estimated 11.4% of drivers stopped by 
police said the reason for the stop was a 
burned out headlight, a loud muffler, or some 
other vehicle defect; 9.2% said a check for
vehicle registration, insurance coverage, 
driver's license, or some other record; 2.3% 
said a roadside check for drunk drivers; 2.3% 
said police suspected them of something;
51.2% said speeding; and 23.6% said reckless 
driving, illegal turn, going through a red 
light, driving too closely, or some other 
traffic offense.

*  The vast majority of drivers stopped 
by police (84%) said they had been stopped 
for a legitimate reason, and an even larger 
majority (90%) felt police had behaved 
properly during the traffic stop.

Citizen contacts with police 
involving force or the threat 
of force

*  During 1999 approximately 422,000 persons 
age 16 or older were estimated to have had 
a contact in which police used or threatened 
to use force against them.  This finding on 
the prevalence of force encounters is similar 
to the estimated 471,000 persons experiencing 
force in 1996.

*  An estimated 2 in 10 persons experiencing 
a force encounter reported that the officer 
issued a threat to use force only.

*  The estimate of the number of persons 
experiencing force or the threat of force 
equals about 1% ( 0.96%) of the nearly 
44 million people reporting face-to-face 
contact with police.

*  Among those with police contact, blacks 
(2%) and Hispanics (2%) were more likely 
than whites (just under 1%) to experience 
police threat or use of force as a consequence
of the contact.

*  Respondents reported that police use or 
threat of force primarily involved the citizen 
being pushed or grabbed: less than 20% of those 
experiencing force reported an injury.

*  Overall, 57% of persons involved in a 
police force incident reported that they 
argued, disobeyed, or resisted the police 
or that they had been drinking or using 
drugs at the time.

*  An estimated 49% of persons involved in 
a force contact had charges filed against 
them -- ranging from a traffic offense to 
resisting arrest to assaulting an officer. 

*  An estimated three-quarters of the 
422,000 persons involved in a police 
force incident characterized the force
as excessive. Whites were as likely 
as blacks to describe the force encounter 
as having been excessive.  There were
not statistically significant differences 
between whites and Hispanics.

*  The vast majority (92%) of persons 
experiencing threat or use of force said 
the police acted improperly.

Police-Public Contact Survey

Title XXI of the Violent Crime Control 
and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 requires 
the Attorney General to publish an annual 
summary of data about the use of excessive 
force by police.  Since that time, the 
following reports have been published:

National Data Collection on Police Use 
of Force (April 1996, NCJ 160113) summarizes 
the literature and research available, 
identifies potential strengths and weaknesses
associated with alternative data collection 
strategies, and identifies a series of 
steps to acquire both administrative
and self-report data.

Police Use of Force: Collection of National 
Data (November 1997, NCJ 165040) provides 
findings from the first Police-Public Contact 
Survey (PPCS-I) conducted in the spring of 
1996 utilizing a nationally representative 
sample of 6,421 respondents age 12 or 
older. In addition, the report describes the 
National Police Use-of-Force Database
Project initiated by the International 
Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) with 
funding from both the National Institute of 
Justice (NIJ) and the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (BJS).  This report also 
included preliminary findings on police-
use-of force from a number of NIJ-funded
studies.

Use of Force by Police: Overview of National 
and Local Data (October 1999, NCJ 176330) 
provides initial data from the IACP's National 
Police Use-of-Force Database Project, presents 
findings from studies of the use of force in six
jurisdictions, and offers new insights into the 
measurement of suspect resistance in use-of-force 
encounters.  In addition, BJS describes 
plans for conducting a second national 
survey during the last half of 1999.

Traffic Stop Data Collection Policies 
for State Police, 1999 (February 2000, 
NCJ 180776) provides an overview of the
status of administrative data collection, 
both manual and electronically accessible 
data, by State police agencies on traffic 
stops and the outcomes associated with 
those stops. The report describes the 
number of States routinely collecting 
information on drivers and other vehicle 
occupants with respect to age, gender, race 
or ethnicity, and immigration status.  The 
study also describes data collected by these 
agencies on use-of-force encounters.

Studies of racial and ethnic disparities 
in police traffic enforcement in New Jersey 
and Maryland also prompted new interest in 
national data from the United States on
variations in law enforcement practices 
attributable to race and ethnicity.  In addition, 
the Congress considered a number of proposals 
addressing the issue of law enforcement integrity, 
with a particular concern about the need for data 
to learn more about racial profiling practices
(Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Acts of 1999 
and 2000). 
     
In June 1999 the President issued an Executive 
Memorandum to Federal law enforcement agencies 
requiring them to examine any practices which may 
be the result of racial profiling. 

Together these concerns led BJS to redesign the 
PPCS-I to gather more detailed information on 
traffic stops, the most frequent form of 
police-citizen contact.  The Police-Public
Contact Survey (PPCS) was pretested in the spring 
of 1999 and was conducted between July 1, 1999, 
and December 31, 1999, as a supplement to the 
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).  

The final questionnaire incorporated some 
elements of the British Crime Survey questions 
on contacts with police to ensure comparability 
to the extent possible.  Extensive public comment 
was received, and a panel of law enforcement
experts designated by the American Statistical 
Association's Committee on Law and Justice 
critiqued the instrument. 

The 1999 PPCS national sample

In 1999 the PPCS respondents included all NCVS 
respondents age 16 or older, with the questionnaire 
administered following the NCVS screener and incident 
forms.  

During the last 6 months of 1999 in which interviews were
conducted, the NCVS sample consisted of 94,717 individuals
age 16 or older. Of these, 10,424, or 11%, were NCVS
non-interviews, though someone else in the household was
interviewed.  In addition to those not interviewed for the
NCVS, 986 persons either refused to participate in the PPCS
or said they were not available for the interview or the
interviewer failed to indicate the specific reason for
non-interview.  

By far the largest reason for not completing the PPCS in
1999, accounting for 2,764 respondents, was the exclusion of
the proxy interviews conducted for the NCVS when a person
was unable, for physical, mental, or other reasons, to
participate.  BJS staff determined that caregivers and
other proxy interviewees would have difficulty describing
the details of any contacts between police and the sampled
respondent.

The PPCS failed to interview 14,174 persons and interviewed
80,543; this translates into an 85% response rate for the
PPCS, compared to an overall response rate of 89% for the
NCVS.  Among the PPCS interviews conducted, 24,829 (31%)
were in person and 55,672 (69%) were by telephone.  

The PPCS national sample, after adjustment for non-response,
weights to a national estimate of 209,350,600 persons age 16
and older. Distributions by gender, race, ethnicity, and age
parallel the resident population projections (middle-series)
published by the Census Bureau (http://www.census. gov/
population/projections/nation/detail/d1999_00.pdf)
reflecting the accuracy of the case-level adjustments to the
weights:

Other information on survey 
methodology

Unless indicated otherwise, differences documented in this
report were significant at the .05-level.  Certain
differences were not significant at the .05- level but were
significant at the .10- level. The term "some indication"
refers to differences significant at the .10-level.

Regarding racial designations given in the report, "white"
refers to non-Hispanic whites, "black" refers to
non-Hispanic blacks, and "other races" refers to
non-Hispanics in the "other races" category. White
Hispanics, black Hispanics, and Hispanics of "other races"
are categorized in the report under the heading "Hispanic."

Due to small samples and concerns about confidentiality, the
report does not provide separate statistics on each of the
racial categories that make up "other races" (Asians,
Pacific Islanders, American Indians, Native Hawaiians, and
Alaska Natives). 

Incidence and prevalence of police-public contact
 
In 1999 there were just over 209 million U.S. residents age
16 or older. Based on the results of the 1999 Police Public 
Contact Survey, conducted during the last 6 months of the
year, an estimated 43.8 million residents, or about 21% of
those age 16 or older, were estimated to have had at least
one face-to-face contact for any reason with a law
enforcement officer during the year. 

Race, Hispanic origin, gender, and 
age of citizens having face-to-face
contact with police 

In 1999 rates of contact between residents and the police
translate into about 1 person with a contact for every 4.8
residents age 16 or older.  

Per capita rates of contact between residents and the police
vary by the race and ethnicity of residents.  White
residents experience contact with law enforcement officers
at the highest rate: about 1 person for every 4.5 white,
non-Hispanic residents age 16 or older experience a
contact.  By contrast, about 1 person for every 5.3 black
residents had contact, and at a lower rate, about 1 Hispanic
for every 6 had a direct contact with a law enforcement
officer.  Per capita, the white rate of police-citizen
contact is about 17% higher than for blacks and about 32%
higher than for Hispanics. Other races, primarily Asians,
Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and Alaska Natives,
experience contact with police at the lowest rate; on
average, there is about 1 person with a contact for every
6.2 persons in the resident population.  

Age and sex are also important factors associated with the
prevalence of police-citizen contacts.  About 1 male of
every 4.4 males age 16 or older had a contact with a police
officer in 1999; among women residents age 16 or older,
there was about 1 with a contact for every 5.2 females. 
Males had a per capita rate of contact about 20% higher than
that for females.

Contact rates generally vary inversely with age: residents
in the youngest age groupings have higher rates of contact
with police than those in the oldest age ranges.  Residents
age 18 to 19 have the highest rates of contact with police: 
the per capita rate of 343 per 1,000 equals about 1 person
of this age with a contact for every 2.9 persons in this age
group.  By contrast, among those 50 or older, rates of
contact equal about 1 person with a contact for every 7.6
persons of this age.
   
Size of jurisdiction

Rates of contact between police and citizens also vary
inversely with the size of the jurisdiction in which the
resident lives.  The smaller the population of the
jurisdiction, the higher the rate of contact with police. 
This finding is illustrated in two ways:  residents of
central cities reported contacts with police at rates of
about 200 persons with contact per 1,000 residents while
residents of non-metropolitan or rural areas reported a 9%
higher rate.  Similarly, residents of jurisdictions with 
fewer than 100,000 residents had a rate of contact with
police which was 37% higher than those residing in
jurisdictions of 1 million or more residents.

Multiple contacts during the year and 
multiple reasons for a contact

Among the 43.8 million persons having contact with a police
officer during the year, many reported more than one contact
or a variety of reasons for having contacts.  Overall, about
two-thirds of those who reported having a contact with a
police officer had only the single contact during the year
and gave a single reason for that contact (table not shown).
The remaining third had combinations of numbers of 
contacts and reasons for contact during the reference year.

Of the 43.8 million persons with 
contacts with police:

*  65% had one contact for a single reason, and for half of
these, the reason for the contact was a vehicle traffic stop

*  an additional 16% of those with contacts had multiple
reasons for contacts with police during the year

*  an additional 11% said they had multiple contacts during
the year but always for the same reason

*  8% had multiple contacts for multiple reasons during the
year.

Persons with contacts with police distribute slightly
differently with respect to their demographic composition
than those who do not report a contact during the year. 
Those with police contacts are generally more likely to be
male, white, and younger than those who do not have contacts
with police:

Contact between citizens and the police can occur in one of
three ways: initiated by a resident, by the police, or by
both. Examples of self-initiated face-to-face contacts with
a police officer include reporting a crime, asking the
officer for assistance or directions, or reporting a
neighborhood problem.  Examples of police-initiated 
contact include motor vehicle stops, being questioned by the
police about a crime as a suspect, victim, or witness, or
attending police-sponsored community meetings on crime
prevention.  Because up to a third of respondents to the
PPCS described multiple contacts for a variety of reasons
during the year, some experienced contacts of both types.

Among the 43.8 million persons with contact with the police,
an estimated 25.9 million persons (59%) experienced only
police-initiated contacts. Nearly 12 million (27%)
experienced only contacts that they had initiated. The
remainder, just over 13% (5.9 million), said that they
had both types of contacts with police during the year
(table not shown). The percentage of respondents
experiencing a police-initiated contact only was inversely
related to age.  While about 8 in 10 16-to-17 year olds with
a face-to-face encounter said that the contacts they had
with police had been initiated by the police, just over half
of those age 35 and older said that the only contacts they
had with police had been initiated by a law enforcement
officer.

Motor vehicle stops, as either a driver or passenger, was
the most frequent reason for contact, cited by more than
half of all persons with a police contact during 1999. 
Motor vehicle stops were also most commonly cited among
those with two or more contacts during the year. Together,
an estimated 22.7 million persons age 16 or older
experienced a traffic stop as a driver or passenger during
1999, about 11% of all persons in this age category.

The second most common reason for contact with police was to
report a crime, accounting for about 1 in 5 persons with a
police contact.  About 8.4 million persons, or about 4% of
the population age 16 or older, were estimated to have
called the police at least once during the year to report 
a crime. 

Overall, about 19% of residents age 16 or older called the
police for the same  problem at least twice during 1999. 

The most common types of recurring reasons for experiencing
a contact with police were: to report a neighborhood
problem, motor vehicle stops, and attending crime prevention
meetings.  About a quarter of those who called the police
about a neighborhood problem during 1999 said that they
called at least twice during the year about their concerns. 

The least frequently recurring reason for police contact was
to have been involved in a traffic accident.  An estimated
3.4 million persons age 16 or older were involved in
accidents in 1999, with about 6% of these persons
reporting they were involved in two or more accidents during
the year.

On a per officer basis, the number of contacts with unique
individuals age 16 or older averaged about 71 in 1999.  That
is, the 622,041 sworn full-time State and local law
enforcement officers in the United States had contacts with
43,827,514 persons that year.  Officers employed in
jurisdictions of less than 100,000 population on average in
1999 had contacts with about 8 times the number of people in
traffic stops as those officers employed in jurisdictions of
1 million or more population.  In fact, for most of the
categories of  reasons for contact, the ratio of contacts to
officers in smaller jurisdictions is between 5 and 8 times
the rate in the largest jurisdictions.  

Varying rates of contacts

In 1999 an estimated 11.3% of whites age 16 or older
experienced at least one traffic stop as a driver or
passenger, a rate equal to 113 per 1,000 whites age 16 or
older in the resident population.  Blacks and Hispanics
experienced traffic stops  while drivers or passengers at
lower rates, 107 per 1,000 and 90 per 1,000, respectively. 
Whites were more likely than blacks or Hispanics to call the
police to ask for assistance, such as directions, and to
report a neighborhood problem.  Whites and blacks were
equally likely to have called the police during 1999 to
report a crime and there were no differences by
race/ethnicity in participation in community crime
prevention meetings sponsored by the police.  In the
aggregate, jurisdiction size was inversely related to the
rate of contact between police and citizens.

For blacks age 16 or older, smaller population areas had
higher contact levels: black residents of areas with fewer
than 100,000 persons had per capita rates of contact which
were 22% higher than for persons residing in jurisdictions
of 1 million or more population.  Among whites and
Hispanics, the highest rates of contact with police occurred
among residents of jurisdictions with populations of 500,000
to 999,999.

---------------------------------
Law enforcement employees and contacts with the public

No national data are available from police officers to
describe their workload and with whom they come into contact
to complement these data drawn from the general population. 
BJS does, however, collect administrative data on the number
of sworn officers.  While levels of contact can be
calculated relative to the number of sworn officers, it is
not known to what extent such measures may accurately
reflect a typical officer's workload and contacts.

In the aggregate during 1999, an estimated 71 persons age 16
or older had contact with a police officer for each sworn
officer employed by State or local law enforcement agencies
nationwide.
---------------------------------------

The single most important factor affecting the rate of
contact between residents and the police is age, largely due
to the age distribution of those persons experiencing a
motor vehicle stop.  Among those ages 18 to 24, the per
capita rate of traffic stops is more than double that of
persons age 40 or older.  In addition, persons age 16 to 19
self-report an involvement in traffic accidents for which
police responded at nearly twice the per capita rate
reported in the aggregate for all age groups.  Finally,
young people, age 16 to 19, describe a rate of contact as a
suspect in crime which is nearly 4 times the per capita rate
for all age groups. 

In other words, for young people, the principal reasons for
higher contact with the police are greater exposure to motor
vehicle stops, higher involvement in traffic accidents, and
greater likelihood of being questioned as a suspect in a
crime.

--------------------------------
Possible criminal conduct 
and contacts with police 
               
Overall, about 7 out of 1,000 per- sons in the population
age 16 or older reported that they had at least one contact
with police during the year for reasons related to possible
criminal conduct:  They were a suspect in a crime or they
were served a warrant by police.   Among subgroups of the
population, men were more than twice as likely as women to
report such reasons for contact, and blacks reported a
higher rate of such contact than whites.  Those age 18 to 19
reported a rate of contact for possible criminal contact
which was much higher than that reported by persons age 50
or older.

Traffic stops

Number of drivers pulled over 
by police in 1999

The number of drivers age 16 or older pulled over by police
at least once in a traffic stop in 1999 totaled 19.3 million
persons.  The 19.3 million estimate is based on the 1999
Police-Public Contact Survey. The 19.3 million includes
stops of all kinds of motor vehicles -- for example,
motorcycles, buses, and private and commercial cars and
trucks -- and both personal and business travel.

Driver gender

Of the 19.3 million drivers stopped during the year,
approximately 11.7 million, or 61%, were male, and 7.6
million, or 39%, were female. 

Driver race/ethnicity

Of the 19.3 million stopped drivers, nearly 14.9 million, or
77%, were white; 2.2 million or 11.6%, were black; and 1.6
million, or 8.4%, were Hispanic.

Driver age

Most stopped drivers were adults under age 40.  Eleven
percent were under age 20, and over 50% were between 20 and
39 years of age. Stopped drivers between ages 40 and 49
accounted for 20% and those age 50 or older, 18%. 

Likelihood of driver being stopped

The 1999 U.S. population totaled 209.4 million persons age
16 or older.  An estimated 89%, or 186.3 million, were
licensed drivers.  On at least one occasion in 1999, 19.3
million were driving a car or other motor vehicle when it
was pulled over by police in a traffic stop. The 19.3 
million stopped drivers represent 10.3% of the Nation's
186.3 million licensed drivers.  In other words, an
estimated 10.3% of all licensed drivers -- approximately 1
in 10 -- were pulled over by police at least once in 1999.

The 19.3 million stopped drivers included 4 million who were
pulled over 2 or more times during the year.  The 4 million
make up 2.1% of the Nation's 186.3 million licensed drivers,
indicating that 2.1% of all licensed drivers   approximately
1 in 50 -- were pulled over more than once in 1999.  

Driver gender 

Ninety-three percent of males and 85% of females age 16 or
older were licensed drivers in 1999.  Males (12.5%) were
more likely than females (8.2%) to be stopped at least once. 
Males (2.9%) were also more likely than females (1.4%) to be
stopped more than once.

Driver race/ethnicity and racial 
profiling 

Among all persons ages 16 or older in 1999, 92% of whites,
74% of blacks, and 86% of Hispanics had a driver's license.

White drivers and Hispanic drivers did not differ
significantly in their chances of being stopped at least
once in 1999 (10.4% of whites and 8.8% of Hispanics) or in
their chances of being stopped more than once in 1999 (2.1%
of whites and 2.0% of Hispanics).

There was some indication that black drivers were more
likely than white drivers to be stopped at least once in
1999: 12.3% of blacks versus 10.4% of whites.  There was
also some indication that black drivers were more likely
than whites to be stopped more than once that year:  3.0% 
of blacks versus 2.1% of whites.

Put another way, blacks were 9.8% of licensed drivers but
11.6% of drivers stopped at least once and 13.7% of drivers
stopped more than once, while whites were 76.8% of licensed
drivers and 77% of those stopped at least once and 74.9% of
those stopped more than once.  Hispanics were 9.8% of
licensed drivers, 8.4% of drivers stopped at least once,
and 9.2% of drivers stopped more than once.

In short, survey results indicated that in 1999 blacks had
higher chances than whites of being stopped at least once
and higher chances than whites of being stopped more than
once. However, these racial differences are not necessarily
evidence that police use race as a factor in deciding
whether to make a traffic stop -- that is, not 
necessarily evidence of "racial profiling."  

To form evidence of racial profiling, the survey would have
to show that (all other things being equal) --

Blacks were no more likely 
than whites to violate traffic laws,

and

Police pulled over blacks at a 
higher rate than whites.  

Because the survey has no information on how often people of
different races break traffic laws -- having only data on
how often people are stopped for breaking these laws --
analysis of the data from the 1999 Police-Public Contact
Survey cannot settle the question of whether or to what
extent racial profiling exists.  Put another way, the
analysis cannot determine whether racial differences in the
breaking of traffic laws rather than racial profiling is the
reason for the higher rates at which black drivers were
stopped by police.

Driver age 

In 1999, 70% of all persons ages 16 to 19 had a driver's
license. Among persons in their twenties, thirties, forties,
or fifties, 90% or more had a license.  Of those ages 60 or
older, 80% were licensed.

The younger the driver, the greater the likelihood that he
or she was pulled over by police at least once in 1999:
18.2% of teenage drivers, 16.8% of drivers in their
twenties, 11.3% of those in their thirties, 9.4% of those in
their forties, 7.7% of those in their fifties, and 3.8% 
of drivers age 60 or older.

The younger the driver, the greater the likelihood that he
or she was pulled over by police more than once in 1999: 
6.5% of teenage drivers, 4.4% of drivers in their twenties,
2.1% of those in their thirties, 1.3% of those in their
forties, 1.1% of those in their fifties, and 0.4% of those
age 60 or older.

Number of traffic stops in 1999

The vast majority (79%) of the 19.3 million drivers stopped
in 1999 had only one traffic stop that year.   By contrast,
1.8% were stopped by police five or more times.  On average,
stopped drivers were pulled over 1.4 times.  The average was
1.4 times for whites and Hispanics.  The average was greater
for blacks (1.6).

Police made an estimated 27 million traffic stops in 1999. 
Whites made up 77.0% of stopped drivers and accounted for
76.7% of traffic stops.  Blacks made up 11.6% of stopped
drivers and accounted for 13.0% of stops.  Hispanics made up
8.4% of stopped drivers and accounted for 8.1% of stops.

Reason for being stopped

Surveyed drivers were asked what reason the officer gave for
the stop:

Most (51.2%) said "speeding".

11.4% said a "vehicle defect" (burned out taillight, loud
muffler, and so forth).

2.3% said a "roadside check for drunk drivers."  (Police may
not stop motorists randomly at roadblocks to search for
drugs but may stop motorists randomly to search for drunken
drivers.)

9.2% said a "record check" of some sort (for example, a
check for driver's license or insurance coverage or vehicle
registration).

2.3% said they were stopped because police "suspected them
of something" (for example, they were out late at night in a
location that attracts people looking for drugs or
prostitutes).

22.7% said "some other traffic offense" (seat belt
violation, illegal turn, going through a red light or a
yellow light or a stop sign or a pedestrian crossing,
following too closely, changing lanes without signaling,
reckless driving, lights not on, loud music, curfew
violation, throwing a cigarette out a window, and so forth).

A small percentage of stopped drivers (1.6%) said police had
not given a reason for the stop.

Driver gender 

Females were more likely than males to say the reason for
the stop was "speeding" (females 54.1%, males 49.3%) or
"record check" (females 10.6%, males 8.3%).  Males were more
likely than females to say "vehicle defect" (males 12.5%,
females 9.6%), "driver suspected of something" (males 3.0%,
females 1.4%), or "other traffic offense" (males 23.6%, 
females 21.3%).  Otherwise, there were no significant
differences between the sexes.  For example, males (2.5%)
and females (1.9%) were not significantly different in
giving "roadside check for drunk drivers" as the reason.

Driver race/ethnicity

Whites were more likely than blacks to say the reason for
the stop was "speeding" (whites 53.7%, blacks 43.4%), and
blacks were more likely than whites to say "other traffic
offense" (whites 21.0%, blacks 28.1%).  Otherwise, there
were no significant differences between blacks and whites. 
For example, whites (2.5%) and blacks (1.4%) were not 
significantly different in having "roadside check for drunk
drivers" as the reason.

Whites were more likely than Hispanics to say "speeding"
(whites 53.7%, Hispanics 42.1%), and Hispanics were more
likely than whites to say "vehicle defect" (whites 10.4%,
Hispanics 15.4%) or "other traffic offense" (whites 21.0%,
Hispanics 27.9%).  Otherwise, whites and Hispanics did not 
differ significantly.  For example, the percentage of whites
(2.5%) and Hispanics (1.3%) who said "roadside check for
drunk drivers" did not differ significantly.

A small percentage of stopped drivers said police had not
given a reason for the stop:  1.5% of whites, 2% of blacks,
2.3% of Hispanics.

Driver age

Speeding -- The most consistent finding was that drivers in
the oldest age category (60 or older) were less likely
(43.1%) than drivers in each of the other age categories to
give "speeding" as the reason for being stopped.

Vehicle defect -- The most consistent finding was that
drivers in the oldest age category (60 or older) were less
likely (7.6%) than drivers in their teens (12.1%), or
twenties (13.5%), or thirties (11.5%) to say "vehicle
defect" was the reason.

Roadside check for drunk drivers -- The most consistent
finding was that teenage drivers (0.7%) were less likely
than drivers in each of the older age categories to say
"roadside check."

Record check -- The most consistent finding was that teenage
drivers (4.4%) and drivers in their twenties (7.2%) were
less likely than drivers in each of the older age categories
to say they were stopped for a "record check."

Driver suspected of something -- The only significant
differences were between teenage drivers and each of the
older age categories.  Teenage drivers stopped by police
(6.1%) were more likely than each of the others to say that
the reason they were stopped was because they were suspected
of something.

Other traffic offense -- The only significant differences
were between drivers age 60 or older and each of the younger
age categories.  Drivers ages 60 or older stopped by police
(29.9%) were more likely than each of the others to say that
the reason they were stopped was for some other traffic
offense.

Traffic tickets

Police issued a traffic ticket to just over half (54.2%) of
the drivers they stopped. Another 26.4% received a warning,
and the remaining 19.4% received neither ticket nor warning.
The 54.2% included 1.6% charged with driving while impaired
or intoxicated.

Driver gender

Males (55.8%) were more likely than females to be ticketed
(51.9%).

---------------------------
Driver opinion on being stopped

The vast majority of drivers pulled over by police (84%)
felt they had been stopped for a legitimate reason.  Still,
opinion was not uniform across the different segments of the
population.

Driver gender
                  
Females (87%) were more likely than males (82%) to say that 
the stop was for a legitimate reason.

Driver race/ethnicity

The vast majority of blacks stopped by police (74%) felt
they had been stopped for a legitimate reason.  So, too, did
the vast majority of Hispanics (82%).  Nevertheless, blacks
and Hispanics were less likely than whites (86%) to say the
police had a legitimate reason for stopping them. 

Driver age

There were no significant differences between drivers of one
age and drivers of another age in terms of opinion about
whether they had been stopped for a legitimate reason.

--------------------------------

Driver race/ethnicity

Police were more likely to ticket blacks (60.4%) and
Hispanics (65.6%) than whites (51.8%).

Put differently, blacks were 11.6% of drivers stopped by
police but 12.9% of ticketed drivers, and Hispanics were
8.4% of stopped drivers but 10.1% of those ticketed, while
whites were 77% of stopped drivers and 73.5% of the ticketed
ones.

Driver age

The younger the driver, the greater the likelihood of a
ticket.  That is, where significant differences existed
between younger and older drivers, they were always in the
direction of a greater likelihood of younger drivers being
ticketed.  For example, teenage drivers (54.5%), and drivers
in their twenties (59.0%), thirties (56.5%), or forties 
(53.9%) were each more likely than either drivers in their
fifties (45.7%) or drivers age 60 or older (40.1%).

Arresting the driver

Three percent of drivers stopped by police were arrested.  
Arrests occurred for a variety of reasons, such as --
*  Failing a sobriety test
*  Having drugs or an illegal weapon 
   on the driver or in the vehicle
*  Having an outstanding warrant 
   for arrest 
*  Assaulting the police officer.

Driver gender 

Males (4.1%) were more likely than females (1.3%) to be 
arrested.

Driver race/ethnicity

Blacks (5.2%) and Hispanics (4.2%) stopped by police were
more likely than whites (2.6%) to be arrested.

Stated differently, blacks were 11.6% of drivers stopped by
police but 19.9% of drivers who were arrested, and Hispanics
were 8.4% of stopped drivers but 11.7% of those arrested,
while whites were 77% of stopped drivers and 66.3% of the
ones who were arrested.

Driver age

The younger the driver, the greater the likelihood of an
arrest.  That is, where significant differences existed
between younger and older drivers, they were always in the
direction of a greater likelihood of the younger driver
being arrested. Teenage drivers (4.2%) and drivers in their
twenties (3.4%), thirties (3.9%), or forties (2.6%) were
more likely than those in their fifties (1.3%) or older
(0.7%).

Handcuffing the driver

Police handcuffed 3.1% of the drivers they stopped.

Driver gender

Males (4.3%) were more likely than females (1.2%) to be
handcuffed in a traffic stop.

Driver race/ethnicity

Blacks (6.3%) and Hispanics (4.9%) were more likely than
whites (2.5%) to be handcuffed.

Stated another way, blacks were 11.6% of drivers stopped by
police but 23.4% of drivers who were handcuffed, and
Hispanics were 8.4% of stopped drivers but 13.2% of those
handcuffed, while whites were 77% of stopped drivers and
61.8% of the ones who were handcuffed.

Driver age

The younger the driver, the greater the likelihood of
handcuffs being used.  That is, where significant
differences existed between younger and older drivers, they
were always in the direction of a greater likelihood of
younger drivers being handcuffed.  For example, drivers in
each of the age categories below age 60 were more likely 
than drivers age 60 or older (0%) to be handcuffed.  Teenage
drivers (4.0%), drivers in their twenties (4.0%), and
drivers in their thirties (3.9%) were more likely to be
handcuffed than drivers in their fifties (1.2%).

Police use of force against driver

Based on survey results, 19.3 million drivers were stopped
by police at least once in 1999.  Surveyed drivers were
asked whether, in their opinion, police had used "force"
against them (not including handcuffing) at any time during
the traffic stop.  Approximately 139,000 drivers -- or 
a little over 0.7% of the 19.3 million stopped by police -
said "yes."  

Surveyed drivers saying police had used force against them
were then asked what type of force.  The most serious type
that a surveyed driver said had been used was police
pointing a gun but not firing; the least serious was a
verbal threat.  From most to least serious, the 10 different 
types of force that surveyed drivers said police had used
were as follows:

1.  Police pointed a gun at you but did not fire.
2.  Police sprayed you with chemical or pepper spray.
3.  Police kicked or hit you with his/her hand or something
held 
   in officer's hand, such as a baton.
4.  Police pushed or grabbed you in a way that caused pain.
5.  Police pushed or grabbed you in a way that did not cause
pain.
6.  Police threatened you by having a hand on his/her gun.
7.  Police threatened to use chemical or pepper spray.
8.  Police threatened to kick you or hit you with the
officer's hand or with something held in the officer's hand
(such as a baton).
9.  Police threatened to push or grab you.
10. Police threatened to arrest you or take you to jail or
take some other nonviolent action.

The survey uncovered evidence of black drivers' having worse
outcomes than whites.  The question arises whether blacks'
having worse outcomes was true regardless of the officer's
race.  To answer it, black and white drivers stopped by
white officers were compared, and black and white
drivers stopped by black officers were compared. Results
suggest that the various racial disparities had nothing to
do with the officer's race.  In other words, blacks
generally had the worse outcome whether they were stopped by
a white officer or a black officer.

A black driver (60.4%) was more likely than a white (51.8%)
to be ticketed.  Among drivers stopped by white officers,
blacks (60.6%) were more likely than whites (52.1%) to be
ticketed.  Though the racial disparity was about as great
among drivers stopped by black officers (65.9% of blacks,
58.3% of whites), the disparity was not statistically
significant, presumably because of the small sample.

A black driver (5.2%) was more likely than a white (2.6%) to
be arrested.  Among drivers stopped by white officers,
blacks (5.3%) were more likely than whites (2.6%) to be
arrested.  Though the racial disparity was about as great
among drivers stopped by black officers (4.6% of blacks,
1.3% of whites), the disparity was not statistically
significant, presumably because of the small sample.

A police officer was more likely to search a vehicle driven
by a black (8.5%) than a white (4.3%), and that was true
regardless of the officer's race.  

A black driver (8.0%) was more likely than a white (3.5%) to
be physically searched. Among drivers stopped by white
officers, blacks (8.6%) were more likely than whites
(3.3%) to be searched.  Though the racial disparity was
nearly as great among drivers stopped by black officers
(5.7% of blacks, 1.8% of whites), the disparity was not
statistically significant, presumably because of the
small sample.

Black drivers stopped by police (74.0%) were less likely
than whites (86.0%) to have the opinion they had been
stopped for a legitimate reason.  Among drivers stopped
by white officers, blacks (72.7%) were less likely than
whites (86.2%) to feel the stop had a legitimate basis.
There was also some indication that, among drivers
stopped by black officers, black drivers (75.2%) were
less likely than whites (84.8%) to say the stop was for
a legitimate reason.
----------------------------------------

"Police shot at you" is not in the list of 10 because,
though surveyed drivers were asked if police had done this, 
none said "yes." Likewise, "police threatened you with a 
police dog" and "police actually unleashed a dog on you" do 
not appear on the list because no one said that police had 
used either of these forms of force.

Driver gender

Males (1.2%) were more likely than females (0%) to say
police had used force against them.
  
Driver race/ethnicity

Police used force against 1.4% of black drivers, 1.4% of
Hispanics, and 0.6% of whites, not a significant difference.

Driver age

The younger the driver, the greater the likelihood that
police used force.  That is, where significant differences 
existed between younger and older drivers, they were always 
in the direction of a greater likelihood of younger drivers 
experiencing police use of force.  For example, drivers in 
each of the age categories below age 60 were more 
likely to experience force than drivers age 60 or older
(0.2%).   Also, drivers in their teens (2.1%), twenties 
(0.9%), or thirties (0.7%) were more likely than drivers in 
their fifties (0.1%) to experience force.

Police use of excessive force 
against driver

Of the nationally estimated 139,000 drivers saying police
had used some type of force (not including handcuffing) against 
them during a traffic stop, nearly 100,000 felt that the force 
was "excessive" .  The 100,000 make up about 72% of the 139,000 
who said police had used force, and a little over one-half of 
1% of the 19.3 million stopped drivers.

Driver gender

Males (0.8%) were more likely than females (0%) to say
police had used excessive force.

Driver race/ethnicity

Police used what the drivers believed to be excessive 
force against 1.0% of blacks stopped and 0.4% of whites 
stopped, not a significant difference.

Hispanics (1.4%) were significantly more likely than whites
(0.4%) to feel that excessive force had been used.  

Driver age

The younger the driver, the greater the likelihood of 
police using excessive force.  That is, where significant 
differences existed between younger and older drivers, 
they were always in the direction of a greater likelihood 
of younger drivers saying that excessive force had 
been used.  For example, drivers in their teens (1.4%),
twenties (0.7%), or thirties (0.6%) were more likely than 
drivers in their fifties (0%) to say excessive force was 
used.  Similarly, drivers in their teens (1.4%) or twenties 
(0.7%) were more likely than drivers in their sixties (0.2%).

Searching the driver, vehicle, or both

During a traffic stop police sometimes conduct a search for
drugs, open containers of alcohol, stolen property, or other
evidence of criminal wrongdoing.  The search may be of the 
vehicle, of the driver, or of both the vehicle and the driver.

In 6.6% of the 19.3 million traffic stops documented in the
1999 national survey, police searched the driver, the vehicle, 
or both.  The 6.6% represent close to 1.3 million drivers who 
said they or their vehicle had been searched.  Of the nearly 
1.3 million searches, 35% were searches just of the vehicle, 
20% were searches just of the driver, and the remaining 45% 
were searches of both the driver and the vehicle. 

Driver gender 

Police were more likely to conduct a search of the vehicle
and/or the driver in traffic stops of males (9.4%) than 
females (2.3%).

Driver race/ethnicity

Black (11.0%) and Hispanic (11.3%) motorists stopped by
police were more likely than whites (5.4%) to be 
physically searched or have their vehicle searched.

Driver age

The younger the motorist, the more likely police were 
to search the vehicle or the driver.  That is, where 
significant differences existed between younger and older 
drivers, they were always in the direction of a greater 
likelihood of younger drivers' being frisked or having 
their vehicle searched.  For example, teenage drivers 
(13.3%) were more likely than drivers in their twenties 
(8.9%), who in turn were more likely than drivers in their 
thirties (6.4%), who in turn were more likely than those 
in their forties (3.8%).

Searching the driver

Overall, 4.3% of stopped drivers were physically searched 
by police.  Such body searches often involve little more 
than the driver being frisked or lightly patted down by 
the officer.  Sometimes though, the search is more invasive, 
involving, for example, the officer's reaching into the 
driver's clothing.

Driver gender 

Driver searches (as distinct from vehicle searches) were
more common among male drivers (6.4%) than female drivers 
(1.2%).

Driver race/ethnicity

Black (8.0%) and Hispanic motorists (7.0%) were more likely
than white motorists (3.5%) to be subjected to a search of 
the driver.

Driver age

The younger the driver, the greater the likelihood of a
search of the driver.  That is, where significant differences 
existed between younger and older drivers, they were always 
in the direction of a greater likelihood of younger drivers 
being searched.  For example, drivers in their twenties 
(6.1%) were more likely than drivers in their thirties 
(4.3%), who in turn were more likely than drivers in their
forties (2.5%).  All drivers, except those in their fifties, 
were more likely than drivers in the oldest age category 
(0.7%).

Searching the vehicle

Police searched the vehicle in about 5% of traffic stops.

Driver gender

Police were more likely to search a vehicle driven by 
a male (7.5%) than a female (1.9%).

Driver race/ethnicity

Police were more likely to search a vehicle driven by a
black (8.5%) or Hispanic (9.7%) than a white (4.3%).

Driver age

The younger the driver, the greater the likelihood of a
vehicle search.  More specifically, where significant 
differences existed between younger and older drivers, 
they were always in the direction of a greater likelihood 
of a vehicle search for the younger drivers.  To 
illustrate, vehicles driven by persons in their thirties
(5.2%) were more likely to be searched than vehicles driven 
by persons in their forties (2.6%) or  in their fifties 
(2.2%).  Teenage drivers (11.7%) and those in their twenties 
(7.1%) or thirties (5.2%) or forties (2.6%) or fifties 
(2.2%) were each more likely than those ages 60 or older 
(0.9%).
 
--------------------------------
Driver opinion on whether police 
acted properly

An estimated 90% of the 19.3 million drivers pulled over 
by police felt that police had behaved properly during 
the traffic stop.

Driver gender 

There was some division of opinion between the approximately
11.7 million males and 7.6 million females stopped by police. 
When asked if police had behaved properly or improperly, 
males (88%) were less likely than females (92%) to say 
"properly."

Driver race/ethnicity

Of the nearly 14.9 million whites stopped by police, 91%
said that police had behaved properly during the traffic 
stop.  That compares to 82% of the 2.2 million blacks 
stopped, and 87% of the 1.6 million Hispanics stopped.  
Though vast majorities of blacks and Hispanics felt police 
had behaved properly, blacks and Hispanics were less likely 
than whites to hold that opinion. 

Driver age

With two exceptions, drivers of one age category were no
different from drivers of another age category in terms 
of opinion about whether police had behaved properly during 
the traffic stop.  The two exceptions were the lower 
percentages of teenage drivers (87%) and drivers in 
their twenties (89%) who felt police had behaved properly 
as compared to drivers in their fifties (92%).

------------------------------------

Searches and racial profiling

One definition of racial profiling is "using race as 
a key factor in deciding whether to make a traffic stop.
"  Another definition is "using race as a key factor in 
deciding whether, during a traffic stop, to search the 
vehicle or the driver." Survey findings reported above 
indicated the following about the likelihood of searches 
and the race or ethnicity of the driver:

1.  Black (11.0%) and Hispanic (11.3%) motorists stopped 
by police were more likely than whites (5.4%) to be 
physically searched or to have their vehicle searched.

2.  Black (8%) and Hispanic motorists (7%) were more likely
than white motorists (3.5%) to be subjected to a physical 
search of the driver.

3.  Police were more likely to search a vehicle driven by a
black (8.5%) or Hispanic (9.7%) than by a white (4.3%).

However, while the survey data can reveal these various
racial disparities they cannot answer the question of 
whether the driver's race, rather than the driver's conduct 
at the time or any other specific circumstances surrounding 
the stop, is the reason the search was conducted.  
That is because the survey did not include questions about
circumstances or driver conduct.  For example, having drugs 
in plain view of police is a circumstance that would normally 
warrant a legal search of the vehicle.  But since the survey 
did not ask drivers whether any drugs within plain view were 
in the vehicle, the analysis is necessarily limited.

Limitation of the survey's 
search data

Surveyed drivers were asked about any searches that police
may have conducted during the traffic stop.  Based on answers 
to these questions, national estimates are made of--

*  the number of drivers who were searched ("C" in figure 4)

-----------------------------------
                         Police
Police asked             conducted
permission to            a search
search, and
the driver --            Yes     No
 
Consented                 A       D
Did not consent           B       E
                     --      --
Total                     C       F
------------------------------------ 

*  the number of searches that were carried out with 
the driver's permission ("searches with consent," "A") 
and the number carried out without permission ("searches 
without consent," "B").

An estimate not available from the survey is the number of
traffic stops in which the driver had refused a request to 
conduct a search and no search was made ("E"). It is 
unavailable because not all surveyed drivers, but only 
drivers who said they or their vehicle had been searched, 
were asked whether the officer had first requested permission 
("A" and "B" ).  Consequently, the survey cannot estimate:

*  how often a driver refused a request to conduct 
a search ("B" + "E")

*  the likelihood of police conducting a search after 
the driver denied permission 

*  the likelihood of a driver giving consent.

Search of driver, vehicle, or both

Search with or without driver consent 

In some jurisdictions an officer need not have any 
suspicion to ask for permission to conduct a search.  
In some, police departments require that the officer 
have at least a "reasonable suspicion" before
asking for permission to conduct a search.  In all 
jurisdictions, if the officer has "probable cause" to 
believe that the person or the vehicle contains 
evidence of a crime, the officer does not need to 
ask for permission.

Of the 1.3 million searches, a third, or about 427,000, 
were by consent. In consent searches the search only 
occurred after the officer had asked for and had been 
granted permission from the driver.  The remaining two-
thirds, or about 845,000, were not by consent; either 
the officer had not asked permission before conducting 
the search, which was the case in about 96% of searches 
without consent, or the officer had asked but the driver 
reported saying "no" (the other 4% of searches
without consent). Physical searches (73.8%) were more 
likely than vehicle searches (52.9%) to be searches 
without consent. 

Likelihood of search finding 
criminal evidence

In 13.3% of the 1.3 million searches, police found drugs, 
an illegal weapon, open containers of beer, or other 
possible evidence of a crime.  The likelihood of finding 
criminal evidence was not significantly different between 
the 845,000 searches without consent (12.9%) and the 
427,000 searches with consent (14.2%) (table not shown).

Driver opinion on searches with or 
without consent

Most (71%) of the approximately 845,000 drivers subjected 
to a search of their body or vehicle without consent felt 
that police had not had a legitimate reason for the search.  
Most (55%) of the roughly 427,000 drivers who had consented 
to being physically searched or having their vehicle searched 
also felt that police had not had a
legitimate reason.

Search of driver

Search with or without consent

Approximately three-fourths (73.8%) of all body searches
were without the driver's consent, according to surveyed 
drivers.

Likelihood of search finding 
criminal evidence

Of the 829,000 physical searches, 92% found no criminal
evidence, according to surveyed drivers.  When evidence 
was found, it was usually alcohol or drugs. The likelihood 
of finding criminal evidence was not significantly different 
between the 612,000 physical searches without consent (7.8%) 
and the 217,000 physical searches with consent (8.5%) 
(table not shown).

Driver opinion on searches with or 
without consent 

Most (72%) of the approximately 612,000 drivers who were
subjected to a physical search without their consent felt 
that police had lacked a legitimate reason for the search 
(table not shown).  Most (52%) of the roughly 217,000 who 
had consented to being physically searched also felt that 
police had not had a legitimate reason.

Search of vehicle

Search with or without consent 

Roughly half of all vehicle searches (52.9%) were 
without driver consent.  

Likelihood of search finding 
criminal evidence

Nearly 90% of vehicle searches (87.4%) found no 
evidence of criminal wrongdoing, according to surveyed 
drivers.  Vehicle searches without consent (13.1%) were 
not significantly more likely than searches with 
consent (12.2%) to uncover evidence (table not shown).

Driver opinion on searches with or 
without consent

Most (79%) of the approximately 540,000 drivers who were
subjected to a vehicle search without their consent felt 
that police had lacked a legitimate reason for the search 
(table not shown).  Most (55%) of the roughly 481,000 who 
had consented to a vehicle search also felt that police 
had not had a legitimate reason.

Interpreting opinion data regarding 
searches

Among drivers who did not give consent to being 
physically searched or to having their vehicle searched, 
most said police did not have a legitimate reason for 
the search.  Among those who did give consent, 
again most said police did not have a legitimate reason 
for the search.  To law enforcement officers, the latter 
might seem contradictory: drivers consenting to a search 
but then saying the search was not for a legitimate 
reason. From a legal perspective, the giving of consent 
can make a search legitimate.

It is not certain what drivers who had given consent meant
when they said police did not have a legitimate reason. 
They were not all necessarily expressing criticism of police.  
Some who had consented may have merely meant that they had 
nothing to hide.

Small sample sizes

Up to now, separate statistics were given on each of four
categories:  physical searches with consent, physical searches 
without consent, vehicle searches with consent, and vehicle 
searches without consent.  Within each of the four, it would 
be desirable to have comparative statistics by gender and 
race and age -- for example, the percentage of white physical 
searches without consent that found criminal evidence compared 
to the percentage of black physical searches without 
consent.  But these detailed estimates would be based on
samples too small to form reliable statistical comparisons.  
By combining physical searches and vehicle searches, additional 
comparisons can be made.  

Searching the driver, vehicle, or 
both:  Gender

Search with or without consent

The proportion of all searches (both physical and vehicle)
that were without consent was identical for males (66%) and
females (66%).

Likelihood of search finding criminal 
evidence

The proportion of male searches finding criminal evidence
(14%) was not significantly greater than that of female 
searches (12%).

Searching the driver, vehicle, 
or both:  Race/ethnicity

Search with or without consent

Black searches (physical or vehicle) were more likely 
to be without consent (74%) than white searches (63%). 

The percentage of all searches that were without the
driver's consent was greater in physical or vehicle 
searches of Hispanics (76%) than whites (63%).

Likelihood of search finding criminal 
evidence

Searches of white drivers or their vehicles were more 
likely to find criminal evidence (17%) than searches 
of blacks (8%), but not significantly more likely than 
searches of Hispanics (10%).

Searching the driver, vehicle, or 
both:  Age

Search with or without consent

The percentage of searches that were without consent 
showed no clear pattern with age.

Likelihood of search finding 
criminal evidence

No comparisons are made between drivers of different ages 
because many of the samples on which the separate age
categories are based are too small to form reliable 
estimates.

Driver opinion on driver, 
vehicle, or both being 
searched

Of the nearly 1.3 million drivers who experienced 
either a vehicle search, a driver search, or both, an 
estimated 34% felt the search (or, in some cases, "both 
searches") was for a legitimate reason.   The remaining 
66% did not feel it was for a legitimate reason.

Driver gender 

Males (34%) were not significantly less likely than 
females (40%) to have the opinion that the search was 
for a legitimate reason.

Driver race/ethnicity 

Blacks (17%) were less likely than whites (39%) to feel 
that police had a legitimate reason for searching them, 
their vehicle, or both.  Opinion did not differ significantly 
between whites and Hispanics (33%).

Driver age

Opinion that the search was for a legitimate reason
generally did not vary with age. 

Driver opinion on being physically 
searched

Of the approximately 829,000 drivers who were physically
searched, an estimated 35% felt the search was for a 
legitimate reason.  The remaining 65% did not feel it was 
for a legitimate reason.

Driver gender 

Males were not significantly different from females in 
their opinion about being physically searched: 36% of 
males and 34% of females felt there was a legitimate 
reason.

Driver race

Blacks who were physically searched by police (22%) were
less likely than whites (40%) to feel that police had a 
legitimate reason for making the search.  Hispanics (28%) 
were not significantly less likely than whites to have 
that opinion.

Driver age

Opinion that the physical search was for a legitimate 
reason did not vary in any uniform way across the ages.

Driver opinion on vehicle being 
searched

Of the 1 million drivers who said their vehicle had been
searched by police, 34% felt the search was for a 
legitimate reason.

Driver gender 

Males were not significantly different from females in
opinion about their vehicle being searched: 33% of 
males and 39% of females felt there was a legitimate 
reason.

Driver race/ethnicity

Blacks whose vehicle was searched (15%) were less likely
than whites (39%) to feel that police had a legitimate 
reason for the search.  Hispanics (31%) were not significantly 
less likely than whites to have that opinion.

Driver age

In general, the older the driver whose vehicle was searched, 
the greater the likelihood that driver felt the search was
for a legitimate reason.

Police use of force

The 1999 Police-Public Contact Survey asked respondents who
said they had a face-to-face contact with police whether 
the police officer(s) used or threatened to use physical 
force against them.  

During 1999 approximately 422,000 persons age 16 or older
said the police used or threatened to use force against 
them at least once.  This amounts to about 1% of the nearly 
44 million people reporting face-to-face police contact 
during 1999.  These overall findings are quite similar to 
those from the 1996 survey, which reported that approximately 
500,000 persons age 12 or older experienced police force 
-- also representing about 1% of those persons who reported 
face-to-face police contact in 1996. 

About three-quarters (76%) of those experiencing force in
1999 said the force used or threatened by the police was
excessive.**In this report "use of force" includes threat 
of force unless otherwise indicated.**  Among all persons 
who had a police contact in 1999, 52.8% were males.  
However, among those experiencing police use or threat of
force, 86.9% were males.

Persons ages 16 to 29 were 34.5% of the estimated 44 
million who had a police contact but 68.1% of those 
experiencing force during a contact.  Persons age 32 
or less accounted for about 75% of all persons who 
reported experiencing police use of force. The median 
age of those experiencing force was 23.  The oldest 
person reporting use of force in the survey was age 72. 

Whites comprised 78.2% of all persons with a police 
contact, blacks 10.6%, and Hispanics 8.1%. About 59% 
of those experiencing force were white, 22.6% black, 
and 15.5% Hispanic.

Likelihood of experiencing force 

Among persons 16 years or older with a face-to-face 
contact, females (.27%) were less likely than males 
(1.58%) to have had a contact with police that resulted 
in force. 

Younger persons age 16 to 29 (1.9%) with police contact were 
significantly more likely than those over age 29 (.47%) to
have had force used against them.  

Among those persons age 16 or older with a face-to-face
contact, blacks (2.06%) and Hispanics (1.85%) were more 
likely than whites (.72%) to have reported that the police 
used or threatened force against them.      

Initiator of the contact resulting
n force

In the vast majority (95.4%) of the 422,000 force cases, 
the citizens said that the police initiated the 
face-to-face contact   most commonly through a traffic-
related incident (39.2%) or because the police 
suspected the citizen of a crime (18.8%) or thought the
person was involved in a crime (17.8%). Traffic-related 
force incidents include cases in which the police stopped 
a motorist and cases in which police responded to an 
accident. 

Kind of force used

Among those 422,000 persons who indicated that the police
used or threatened to use force against them, 77.5% said 
police actually used force and 22.5% said force was threatened 
but not actually employed.   

                                  Percent of

Threat only             94,744        22.5

Respondents who said they experienced police use of 
force were asked to describe the type of force.  About 
72% of the 422,000 persons involved in a force incident 
said the police pushed or grabbed them.  In about half 
of these cases the respondent reported experiencing pain.  
An additional 13.9% said the police threatened to push or
grab them.

Among those 422,000 involved in a force-related incident,
15.3% of the persons said the police pointed a gun at them.  
Other types of force or threats included the use of chemical 
spray (9.8%) and the threat to fire a gun (5.4%).  No person 
in the survey reported that an officer actually fired a gun 
at him or her. Likewise, the survey did not contain any 
respondents who reported being bitten by a police dog.

Amount of force

Citizens involved in a force incident were asked if they
felt any of the physical force used or threatened against 
them was excessive.  Most (76.1%) of the 422,000 people 
involved in a police use of force incident said the force 
was excessive.  Whites (73.1%) involved in force incidents 
were just as likely as blacks (72.1%) to say the force was 
excessive.  Among Hispanics with force used against them, 
88.8% said it was excessive.  There was not a 
statistically significant difference among estimates for
whites, blacks, and Hispanics.  

Citizens who characterized the incident as police use of
excessive force most frequently identified the pushing or 
grabbing with pain (40.2%) or without pain (28.4%) as 
excessive.  About three-quarters of those who said the police 
officer pointed a gun at them thought it was excessive (not 
shown in table).

Injuries from force

Overall, about 15% of the approximately 422,000 persons
involved in a force or threat of force incident reported 
that they were injured as a result of the police action.   
Twenty percent of whites, 10.5% of Hispanics, and 8.2% of 
blacks in force incidents were injured.  These differences 
were not statistically significant. 

The most common type of injury sustained was bruises and
cuts -- 86.3% of those injured.

The 64,000 respondents who said they were injured were 
asked what kind of treatment, if any, they received for 
their injuries. About 40% of injured persons did not 
receive any treatment, 33.5% received emergency services, 
and 19.7% administered self-treatment. 

Characteristics of incident

About two-thirds of those involved in a force or threat 
of force incident said the police searched them or their 
vehicle. About 14% of the persons with force reported that 
during the course of the force incident the police found 
an item such as drugs, an open alcohol container, or a 
weapon on or near them or their vehicle. 

Forty-nine percent of the 422,000 persons involved in a
contact with force had at least one kind of charge filed 
against them   ranging from a traffic offense to assaulting 
an officer.   A traffic-related offense was one of the most 
common charges (12%).  

Six percent were charged with drunk driving.  About 8% 
were charged with resisting arrest and 3.4% were charged 
with assaulting a police officer.  

Officers involved in force incidents

Most incidents involving force had more than one officer
present (not shown in table).   About 20% of the persons 
involved in a force incident reported that a single officer 
was present.  The median number of officers involved in a 
force incident was two.      

Most persons (85.4%) involved in force incidents said the
officer or a majority of officers was white and 3.6% said 
the officer or a majority was black. 

Citizen conduct 

Persons experiencing force or threat of police force were 
specifically asked if they thought any of their actions
during the incident may have provoked the police officer(s) 
to use or threaten to use physical force.  About 1 in 4 said 
they did something to provoke the officer:

Hispanic             65,530      12,919        19.7
 
Question: "Do you think any of your actions
during (this/the most recent) incident may
have provoked the police officer(s) to use or 
threaten to use physical force?"

Whites were not significantly more likely than blacks 
to say specifically they did something during the 
incident to provoke the police officer(s).

Respondents were also asked whether they had engaged 
in any of the following listed actions during the 
incident:  

Verbal
*  Argued with or disobeyed the police officer(s)
*  Cursed at, insulted, or called the police officer(s) 
   a name 
*  Said something threatening to the police officer(s)

Cooperation
*  Resisted being handcuffed or arrested
*  Resisted being searched or having the vehicle searched
*  Tried to escape by hiding, running away, or being in a 
   high-speed chase

Physical resistance
*  Grabbed, hit, or fought with the police officer(s)
*  Used a weapon to threaten the police officer(s)
*  Used a weapon to assault the police officer(s)

Other
*  Did anything else that might have caused the police
   officer to use or threaten to use physical force 
   against you.

This question was asked of all persons with force 
regardless of their response to the above specific 
question about whether they provoked the police.

Overall, 57.0% reported they had engaged in at least 
one type of action during the incident such as arguing, 
disobeying, or resisting the police or using alcohol 
or drugs.

Whites (72.7%) involved in a force incident were
significantly more likely than blacks (23.6%) to have 
reported at least one type of action during the incident, 
including drinking or using drugs.  Among Hispanics with 
force, 52.6% reported they did something during the incident. 

A third of those involved in a force incident said they
argued with or disobeyed the police officer.  Slightly 
more than 1 in 10 said they cursed or insulted the officer.

Other actions reported by persons experiencing police use of 
force include resisting arrests or handcuffing (7.2%),
trying to escape (5.1%), and fighting with the police (2.4%). 

Whites (43.0%) and Hispanics (43.9%) involved in a force or 
threat of force incident were significantly more likely 
than black citizens (15.2%) to say that they argued with the 
police during the incident. 

---------------------------------------------
Attitudes toward the police differ by race   

Several sources of public opinion indicate that the police
enjoy a generally favorable image among the public.  However,
differences do exist among black and white citizens regarding 
their perceptions of the police.  Blacks are less likely than 
whites to express a favorable opinion of the police, 
to have confidence in the police, or to think the police 
should use force in any situation. 

In 2000 a majority of persons (81%) surveyed in the United 
States said they had a favorable opinion of their local 
police as well as the State police or troopers in their area.  
Whites (85%) were more likely than blacks (58%) to have had 
a favorable opinion of their local police.
***Footnote 1: Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, 
1999, BJS, table 2.34, Gallup Organization, Gallup Poll 
Monthly, December 1999, no. 411.***  

Differences between black and white respondents can also be
found when asked about their level of confidence in the police. 
In a 2000 national survey, 57% of whites said they had a great
deal or quite a lot of confidence in the police, compared to 
38% of blacks.  Nationally a majority of persons (54%) said 
they had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in the 
police.***Footnote 2: Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, 
1999, BJS, table 2.18, Gallup Organization, 2000.***     

White and black attitudes toward police use of force have 
consistently differed over the past 25 years as measured by 
the survey question "[a]re there any situations you can
imagine in which you would approve of a policeman striking 
an adult male citizen?"  Surveyed annually over this time 
period, a larger percentage of whites -- about three-quarters 
-- than blacks -- about half -- responded "yes."

1999, BJS, table 2.36, National Opinion Research Center, 
General Social Surveys, 1972-1998. Question: "Are

approve of a policeman striking an adult male citizen?"***  
--------------------------------

--------------------------------
The median age of persons
involved with the police
generally declined as the contact
became more serious, 1999

Half the citizens with face-to-face contact with the police
were age 36 or younger, 6 years younger than the median 
for the whole population over age 16.  Half the persons who 
reported experiencing force by a police officer were age 23 
or younger.

Persons reporting
that they experienced

------------------------------------- 

Respondents were specifically asked if they had been using
alcohol or drugs during the force incident.  Twenty-one 
percent of the citizens involved in a force or threat of 
force incident said they were using drugs and/or alcohol at 
the time.  Whites involved with police force (25.7%) were 
significantly more likely than blacks (10.0%) to have reported 
that they had used alcohol or drugs during the incident.

Force and arrests

Less than half (42.3%) of the persons who said force was
used or threatened against them were arrested during the 
incident.  Whites (45.9%) who experienced police force were 
not significantly more likely than blacks (37.1%) or Hispanics 
(35.5%) to also have been arrested.

Force and handcuffing

About half (52.1%) the persons experiencing force were also 
handcuffed during the incident -- including 48.8% of whites, 
67.2% of blacks, and 43.0% of Hispanics.  These differences 
were not statistically significant.

Citizen appraisal of police conduct 

The vast majority (91.9%) of the persons involved in police
use of force incidents said the police acted improperly.  
Whites (88.5%) were nearly as likely as blacks (94.4%) to 
contend the police acted improperly.   

Although the majority of persons with force felt the police 
had acted improperly, less than 20% of these people (about
59,600) said they took formal action such as filing a complaint 
or lawsuit with the authorities. 

Those that did file a complaint were most likely (66.1%) to
do so with the agency employing the police officer(s) involved
in the force incident.  Few (3.7%) citizens who took formal
action filed a police use of force complaint with their local
prosecutor's office.
