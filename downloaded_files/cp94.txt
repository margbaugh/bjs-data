Capital Punishment 1994
------------------------
            
Thirteen States executed 31 prisoners during 1994. 
The number of persons executed was seven fewer than
in 1993. The prisoners executed during 1994 had
been under sentence of death an average of 10 years
and 2 months, about 9 months more than the average
for inmates executed the previous year.

At yearend 1994, 2,890 prisoners were under
sentence of death.  Texas held the largest number
of death row inmates (394), followed by California
(381), Florida (342), and Pennsylvania (182).  Six
prisoners were in Federal custody under a death
sentence on December 31, 1994.

Between January 1 and December 31, 1994, 26 State
prison systems received 304 prisoners under
sentence of death. Texas (43 admissions), Florida
(39), North Carolina (27), and Alabama (24)
accounted for 44% of the inmates entering prison
under a death sentence in 1994.

During 1994, 31 persons in 13 States were
executed--14 in Texas; 5 in Arkansas; 2 in
Virginia; and 1 each in Delaware, Florida, Georgia,
Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Nebraska, North
Carolina, and Washington.  All were men. Eighteen
of the executed prisoners were non-Hispanic whites;
10 were non-Hispanic blacks; 1, white Hispanic; 1,
white with unknown Hispanic origin; and 1, black
with unknown Hispanic origin.  Twenty-three of the
executions were carried out by lethal injection, 6
by electrocution, 1 by lethal gas, and 1 by
hanging.

From January 1, 1977, to December 31, 1994, a total
of 4,557 persons entered State and Federal prisons
under sentences of death, among whom 51% were
white, 40% were black, 7% were Hispanic, and 2%
were of other races. 

During this 18-year period, a total of 257
executions took place in 24 States.  Of the inmates
executed, 140 were white, 98 were black, 17 were
Hispanic, and 2 were Native American.  

Also during 1977-94, 1,790 prisoners were removed
from a death sentence as a result of dispositions
other than execution (resentencing, retrial,
commutation, or death while awaiting execution). 
Of all persons removed from under a death sentence,
53% were white, 41% were black, 0.9% were Native
American, 0.4% were Asian American, and 5% were
Hispanic.

------------------
Statutory changes
-------------------

During 1994, 14 States revised statutory provisions
relating to the death penalty.  Most of the changes
involved additional aggravating circumstances,
additional categories of victims permitting the
application of the death penalty, and broadening of
the law to allow a defendant to choose between two
methods of execution.  

In one State, Washington, a U.S. district court
struck the portion of a statute related to sentence
review by the Washington Supreme Court.  By State,
these statutory changes were as follows:

Alabama--Added to its list of capital offenses use
of any weapon from outside a dwelling or car to
kill a person in that dwelling or car and use of a
weapon from within a car to kill a person
(13A-5-40).  These revisions became effective
4/26/94.

Colorado--Added to its penal code as aggravating
factors murder of two or more persons during the
same criminal episode(16-11-103(5)(l)), effective
3/15/94; and intentional killing of a child under
age 12 (16-11-103(5)(m)), effective 5/4/94.

Delaware--Added to its penal code as aggravating
factors murder of a child age 14 or younger by a
person at least 4 years older than the victim,
killing of a nongovernmental informant in
retaliation for providing information concerning
criminal activity to an investigative agency, and
premeditated murder resulting from "substantial
planning" for the commission of that murder itself,
effective 7/14/94.

Florida--Added new sections to and revised an act
relating to death sentences. In specifying
conditions of a sentence to life in prison without
the possibility of release, the revision eliminates
a previous stipulation of release if the offense
was a capital felony.  The stipulation was that the
offender could be released after 25 years (FS
790.161, FS 775.082).  These revisions became
effective 5/25/94.  

Florida lawmakers also amended a statute making
confidential any information which, if released,
would identify the executioner (FS 922.10).

Idaho--Amended its penal code to remove the
requirement that the court determine whether the
sentence of death is disproportionate to the
penalty imposed in similar cases (19-2827),
effective 7/1/94.

Illinois--Added to its penal code the aggravating
factors of intentional killing ordered or committed
by the leader of a drug trafficking organization
(720-ILCS 5/9-1(b)(13)) and intentional murder
involving the infliction of torture (720-ILCS
5/9-(b)(14)), effective 1/1/94.

Indiana--Added murder by intentionally discharging
a firearm into an inhabited dwelling or from a
vehicle and murder during criminal gang activity to
the list of aggravating circumstances (35-50-2-9),
effective 7/1/94.

Kansas--Enacted a law creating the crime of capital
murder and providing for a sentence of death if any
of seven aggravating circumstances exists.  The new
law prohibits sentencing mentally retarded persons
to death (Ch. 252, 1994 session), effective 7/1/94.

Maryland--Revised its penal code to allow that any
person sentenced to death shall be executed by
lethal injection.  Persons sentenced to death by
lethal gas prior to March 25, 1994, will be
executed by lethal injection unless a written
request was made within 60 days after March 25 (Md.
Ann. Code Art. 27,  sections 71, 72, 73, 627)
.
Mississippi--Amended its code of criminal procedure
to establish responsibility of the Mississippi
Supreme Court, upon determination that one or more
of the aggravating circumstances was invalid, for
review of and re-sentencing in the case (Miss. Code
Ann. 99-19-105 (3)(d) and (5)(h)), effective 
8/23/94.

New Jersey--Added as an aggravating factor the
murder of a person younger than 14 years of age
(NJS.2C:11-3c(4)(k)), effective 10/31/94.

North Carolina--Amended its code of criminal
procedure to allow, only  by order of a judge,
admission of a defendant's juvenile record as
evidence in either the guilt phase or to prove an
aggravating factor at sentencing (Section 1. G.S.
7A-675(a)), effective 10/1/94. 

South Dakota--Added new sections to an act relating
to death sentences.  These sections became
effective 7/1/94.  

In defining aggravating circumstances allowing for
prosecution as a capital offense, the revision
eliminates "substantial history of serious
assaultive criminal convictions" in favor of
"felony conviction for a crime of violence as
defined in subdivision 22-1-2(9)" (SDCL 23A-27A-1).

South Dakota lawmakers also specified what
qualifies as relevant evidence in the pre-sentence
hearing following a guilty verdict in a capital
case.  Relevant evidence includes evidence of
aggravating factors; impact testimony from the
family of the victim; defendant's prior criminal or
juvenile record, financial condition, and
circumstances of the defendant's behavior; and all
evidence concerning mitigating circumstances (SDCL
23A-27A-2).

Tennessee--Revised a statute to change an
aggravating circumstance, murder of a person under
age 13, to include any person under age 16 (Tenn.
Code Ann. 30-13-202(a)(4)), effective 7/1/94. 
 
Washington--The Federal District Court [in Harris
By and Through Ramseyer v. Blodgett (F.Supp. 1239
(W.D.Wash. 1994))] struck in part the statute
providing for sentence review.  The proportionality
review was held to be a violation of due process. 
The lack of guidelines governing the review created
a process that was not reliable or constitutional. 
The effective date was May 17, 1994.

-----------------
Automatic review
-----------------

Of the 37 States with capital punishment statutes
at yearend 1994, 36 provided for review of all
death sentences regardless of the defendant's
wishes.

Arkansas had no specific provisions for automatic
review, and the issue was in litigation in South
Carolina.  The Federal death penalty procedures did
not provide for automatic review after a sentence
of death had been imposed.  While most of the 36
States authorized an automatic review of both the
conviction and sentence, Idaho, Indiana, Montana,
Oklahoma, and Tennessee required review of the
sentence only.  In Idaho, review of the conviction
had to be appealed or forfeited.  In Indiana, a
defendant could waive review of the conviction. 

The review was usually conducted by the State's
highest appellate court regardless of the
defendant's wishes.  (In Mississippi the question
of whether a defendant could waive the right to
automatic review of the sentence had not been
addressed; and in Wyoming neither the statute nor
case law clearly precluded a waiver of an appeal.) 
If either the conviction or the sentence was
vacated, the case could be remanded to the trial
court for additional proceedings or for retrial. 
As a result of retrial or resentencing, the death
sentence could be reimposed.

Minimum age
------------

In 1994 eight jurisdictions did not specify a
minimum age for which the death penalty could be
imposed.  In some States the minimum age was set
forth in the statutory provisions that determine
the age at which a juvenile may be transferred to
criminal court for trial as an adult.  Thirteen
States and the Federal prison system required a
minimum age of 18. Sixteen States indicated an age
of eligibility between 14 and 17.

Characteristics of prisoners under sentence 
of death at yearend 1994
-----------------------------------------------

Thirty-four States and the Federal prison system
held a total of 2,890 prisoners under sentence of
death on December 31, 1994, a gain of 161 or 5.9%
more than at the end of 1993.  The Federal prison
system count remained steady at six during 1994. 
Three States reported 39% of the Nation's death row
population: Texas (394), California (381),  and
Florida (342).  Of the 38 jurisdictions with
statutes authorizing the death penalty, New
Hampshire and Wyoming had no one under a capital
sentence, and Connecticut, South Dakota, New
Mexico, and Colorado had 4 or fewer.

Among the 34 States with prisoners under sentence
of death at yearend 1994, 20 had more inmates than
a year earlier, 6 had fewer inmates, and 8 had the
same number.  Texas had an increase of 28, followed
by California (18), Florida (17), Alabama (15),
Pennsylvania (14), North Carolina (12), and
Ohio(11).  Idaho had the largest decrease (2).

During 1994 the number of blacks under sentence of
death increased by 86; the number of whites
increased by 68; and the number of persons of other
races (Native Americans and Asians or Pacific
Islanders) increased by 7.

The number of Hispanics sentenced to death rose
from 209 to 224 during 1994.  Twenty-five Hispanics
were received under sentence of death, 8 were
removed from death row, and 1 was executed. 
Three-fourths of the Hispanics were incarcerated in
4 States: Texas (63), California (55), Florida
(32), and Arizona (20).

During 1994 the number of women sentenced to be
executed increased from 36 to 41.  Five women were
received under sentence of death, and none was
removed from death row or executed.  Women were
under sentence of death in 14 States.  Nearly half
of all women on death row at yearend were in
Alabama, California, Florida and Illinois.

Men were 98.6% (2,849) of all prisoners under
sentence of death.  Whites predominated (56.9%);
blacks comprised 41.4%; and other races (1.7%)
included 23 Native Americans, 17 Asian Americans,
and 8 persons of unknown race.  Among those for
whom ethnicity was known, 8.4% were Hispanic.

The race, sex, and Hispanic origin of those under
sentence of death at yearend 1994 were as follows:

Hispanic      2       1       0

Among inmates under sentence of death on December
31, 1994, for whom information on education was
available, about three-fourths had either completed
high school (37.4%) or finished 9th, 10th, or 11th
grade (37.1%).  The percentage who had not gone
beyond eighth grade (15.3%) was about 50% larger
than that of inmates who had attended some college
(10.2%).  The median level of education was the
12th grade.  

Of inmates under a capital sentence and with
reported marital status, nearly half had never
married; somewhat more than a fourth were married
when they were sentenced; and nearly a fourth were
divorced, separated, or widowed.  

Among all inmates under sentence of death, 44% were
age 30 to 39 on December 31, 1994, and 73% were age
25 to 44.  The median age was 35 years.  Less than
1% were younger than 20 and 3% were age 55 or
older.  The youngest offender under sentence of
death was age 17; the oldest was 79.  More than
half of all inmates under sentence of death at
yearend 1994 were age 20 to 29 when they were
arrested for their capital offense; 11% were age 19
or younger; and less than 1% were age 55 or older.

-----------------------------------------------
Entries and removals of persons under sentence 
of death 
-----------------------------------------------

Between January 1 and December 31, 1994, 26 State
prison systems  reported receiving  304 prisoners
under sentence of death.  Forty-four percent of the
inmates were received in 4 States:  Texas (43),
Florida (39), North Carolina (27), and Alabama
(24).  

All 304 prisoners who had been received under
sentence of death had been convicted of murder.  By
sex and race, 158 were white men, 133 were black
men, 2 were Native American men, 1 was an Asian
man, 5 were men of other or unspecified race, 2
were white women, and 3 were black women.  Of 304
new admissions, 25 were Hispanic men.  No Hispanic
women were admitted under sentence of death in
1994. 

Twenty-six States reported a total of 100 persons
whose sentence of death was overturned or removed. 
Appeals courts vacated 63 sentences while upholding
the convictions and vacated 32 sentences while
overturning the convictions.  Florida (17 exits)
had the largest number of vacated capital
sentences.  Georgia reported one removal on the
basis of mental retardation.  Georgia, Nevada,
Ohio, and Virginia each reported one commutation of
a death sentence. 

As of December 31, 1994, 43 of the 100 persons who
were formerly under sentence of death were serving
a reduced sentence, 18 were awaiting a new trial,
28 were awaiting resentencing, 1 was found not
guilty in retrial, 2 had all capital charges
dropped, 1 was resentenced to time served, 1 was
released after expiration of a new sentence, 1 was
resentenced to death, and 5 had no action taken
after being removed from under sentence of death.

In addition, 12 persons died while under sentence
of death in 1994.  Eight of these deaths were from
natural causes--three in Florida, two in Arizona,
and one each in California, Illinois, and
Pennsylvania.  Three suicides occurred--one each in
Alabama, California, and Florida.  One inmate in
California was shot to death by a correctional
officer during an altercation.

From 1977, the year after the Supreme Court upheld
the constitutionality of revised State capital
punishment laws, to 1994, a total of 4,557 persons
entered prison under sentence of death.  During
these 18 years, 257 persons were executed, and
1,790 were removed from under a death sentence by
appellate court decisions and reviews,
commutations, or death. (An individual may have
received and been removed from under a sentence of
death more than once).

Among individuals who received a death sentence
between 1977 and 1994, 2,336 (51%) were white,
1,838 (40%) were black, 316 (7%) were Hispanic, and
67 (2%) were of other races.  The distribution by
race and Hispanic origin of the 1,790 inmates who
were removed from death row between 1977 and 1994
was as follows:  940 whites (53%), 735 blacks
(41%), 90 Hispanics (5%), and 25 persons of other
races (1%).  Of the 257 who were executed, 140
(54%) were white, 98 (38%) were black, 17 (7%) were
Hispanic, and 2 (1%) were other races.

-----------------------------------------------
Criminal history of inmates under sentence 
of death in 1994
-----------------------------------------------

Among inmates under a death sentence on December
31, 1994, for whom criminal history information was
available, 67% had past felony convictions,
including 9% with at least one previous homicide
conviction.

Among those for whom legal status at the time of
the capital offense was reported, 42% had an active
criminal justice status.  Nearly half of these were
on parole and a fourth were on probation.  The
others had charges pending, were in prison, had
escaped from incarceration, or had some other
criminal justice status.  

Criminal history patterns differed  by race and
Hispanic origin.  Relatively more blacks (72%) than
whites (65%) or Hispanics (60%) had a prior felony
conviction.  About the same proportion of  blacks
(9%), whites (8%), or Hispanics (8%) had a prior
homicide conviction.  A relatively higher
proportion of Hispanics (27%) than whites (17%) or
blacks (23%) were on parole when arrested for their
capital offense. 

Since 1988 data have been collected on the number
of death sentences imposed on entering inmates. 
Among the 1,976 individuals received under sentence
of death during that time, about 1 in every 7
entered with two or more death sentences.

After the Supreme Court reinstated the death
penalty in 1976,  24 States executed 257 prisoners:

1977     1   1987    25
1979     2   1988    11
1981     1   1989    16
1982     2   1990    23

1983     5   1991    14
1984    21   1992    31
1985    18   1993    38
1986    18   1994    31

During this 18-year period, 5 States executed 181
prisoners:  Texas (85), Florida (33), Virginia
(24), Louisiana (21), and Georgia (18).  These
States accounted for 70% of all executions. 
Between 1977 and 1994, 139 white non-Hispanic men,
98 black non-Hispanic men, 17 Hispanic men, 2
Native American men, and 1 white non-Hispanic woman
were executed.

During 1994 Texas carried out 14 executions; 
Arkansas executed 5 persons; Virginia, 2; and
Illinois, Indiana, Nebraska, Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Idaho, and
Washington, 1 each.  All persons executed in 1994
were male.  Nineteen were non-Hispanic whites; 11
were non-Hispanic blacks; and 1 was Hispanic.

From 1977 to 1994, 4,937 prisoners were under death
sentences for varying lengths of time. The 257
executions accounted for 5.2% of those at risk.  A
total of 1,790 prisoners (36.3% of those at risk)
received other dispositions.  About the same
proportion of whites (6%) as Hispanics (5%) and
blacks (5%) were executed.  Somewhat larger
relative numbers of whites (37%) and blacks (36%)
than Hispanics (27%) were removed from under a
death sentence by means other than execution.

Among prisoners executed between 1977 and 1994, the
average time spent between the imposition of the
most recent sentence received and execution was
slightly more than 8 years.  White prisoners had
spent an average of 7 years and 8 months, and black
prisoners, 8 years and 10 months.  The 31 prisoners
executed in 1994 were under sentence of death an
average of 10 years and 2 months.

For the 257 prisoners executed between 1977 and
1994, the most common method of execution was
lethal injection (131).  Other methods were
electrocution (114), lethal gas (9), hanging (2),
and firing squad (1). Among prisoners under
sentence of death at yearend 1994, the average time
spent in prison was 6 years and 4 months.

The median time between the imposition of a death
sentence and yearend 1994 was 69 months, and the
mean time was 76 months.  Overall, the average time
for women was 4.8 years--about three-fourths as
long as for men (6.3 years).  On average, whites,
blacks, and Hispanics had spent from 72 to 78
months under a sentence of death.

Methodological note 
---------------------

The statistics reported in this Bulletin may differ
from data collected by other organizations for a
variety of reasons:  (1) National Prisoner
Statistics (NPS) adds inmates to the number under
sentence of death not at sentencing but at the time
they are admitted to a State or Federal
correctional facility. (2) If in one year inmates
entered prison under a death sentence or were
reported as being relieved of a death sentence but
the court had acted in the previous year, the
counts are adjusted to reflect the dates of court
decisions.  (3) NPS counts for capital punishment
are always for the last day of the calendar year
and will differ from counts for more recent
periods.
