Highlights

*  In 2001 two-thirds of all full-time chief
prosecutors and all 532 part-time chief
prosecutors served a prosecutorial district
with a population under 250,000.

*  Full-time offices serving districts with 
a population under 250,000 employed a
workforce of 25,884 attorneys, investigators, 
victim advocates, and support staff; the 
total accounted for about a third of the 
total employment for all prosecutors' 
offices nationwide.

*  Full-time offices serving districts with 
a population under 250,000 had combined
budgets for prosecutorial functions
totalling over $1 billion.  Forty-six percent
of full-time offices serving districts with 
a population under 20,000 received all of
their funding from the county government. 

*  Nine out of ten full-time prosecutors'
offices serving districts with a population
under 250,000 handled domestic violence
and child abuse cases. 

*  Nearly two-thirds of full-time offices
serving districts with a population between
100,000 and 249,999 reported prosecuting
either felony or misdemeanor computer
crimes under their State's statutes.

*  Over 890,000 felony cases were closed
by full-time offices serving districts with 
a population under 250,000. Staff also
participated in over 28,000 jury trials 
that resulted in a verdict.

*  About 15,500 juvenile cases were
proceeded against in criminal court by
full-time offices serving districts with 
a population under 250,000.  Half of the
full-time offices proceeded against 5 or
more juvenile cases in criminal court.  

*  Almost two-thirds of full-time offices
serving districts with a population under
250,000 used DNA evidence in plea
negotiations and half of the full-time 
offices used it during felony trials. 
---------------------------------------------

In 2001 across the Nation an estimated 9 
in 10 prosecutors' offices served a district
with a population of less than 250,000. 
These 2,113 prosecutors' offices represented 
almost 40% of the Nation's population. Three-
quarters or 1,581 of these offices had a 
full-time chief prosecutor.  Results from the 
National Survey of Prosecutors (NSP) indicate 
that these offices with a full-time chief 
prosecutor closed over 893,000 felony cases 
and had combined budgets totalling over $1.1 
billion for prosecutorial functions.  The 
median number of felony cases closed per 
office was 288, and the median budget was
$379,000.
    
The 2001 NSP was a census of all chief
prosecutors that tried felony cases in 
State courts of general jurisdiction.
***Footnote 1: The 1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996 
NSP data collections surveyed a nationally
representative sample of chief prosecutors
that tried felony cases in State courts of
general jurisdiction.***  The census did not 
include municipal attorneys or county
attorneys who primarily operate in courts 
of limited jurisdiction.  

This is the third report based on results 
from the 2001 NSP which focuses on
prosecutors' offices with a full-time 
chief prosecutor serving a district with a
population under 250,000.***Footnote 2: State
Court Prosecutors in Large Districts, 2001,
NCJ 191206, and Prosecutors in State Courts,
2001, NCJ 193441 are available <http://www.
0jp.usdoj.gov/bjs>

Even though they constitute the majority of
prosecutors' offices nationwide, little
information has been reported about
prosecutors' offices serving smaller districts
with a population under 250,000.  The 2001
NSP provides the first opportunity to
comprehensively examine these offices.

Generally, the 2001 NSP results revealed
that compared to offices serving districts
with a population of 500,000 or more,
full-time offices serving districts with a
population under 250,000 had fewer
assistant prosecutors (including supervisory
attorneys) per 100,000 residents (8.3 versus
11.5), had smaller per resident amounts
budgeted ($11.30 versus $23.70), closed
more felony cases per assistant prosecutor
(including supervisory attorneys) (109
versus 72), and closed more felony cases
per 100,000 residents (903 versus 823).
         
The size of the prosecutorial district varied
considerably among the 1,581 full-time
offices.  For example, the prosecutors' office
in Galveston County, Texas, served a population 
of about 248,000 while the prosecutors' office 
in Banner County, Nebraska, served a population 
of 831. Since staffing, budget, and workload 
often differ according to the size of the
prosecutorial district, this report presents
information in the aggregate for all 1,581
offices with a full-time chief prosecutor and
then by categories for offices that served a
district with a population bracketed as follows: 
100,000-249,000, 50,000-99,999, 20,000-49,999, 
and under 20,000.

Eight out of ten full-time prosecutors' offices
serving a population under 250,000 had a
prosecutorial district consisting of one
county.  Virtually all full-time offices that
served a population under 20,000 had a
prosecutorial district comprised of one
county compared to two-thirds of offices
serving a population between 100,000 and
249,999.  Half of all full-time prosecutors'
offices represented a district with a
population of 41,000 or fewer.  The average
population served by the 1,581 full-time
offices was 63,000 (not shown in a table).

Staffing

In 2001 full-time prosecutors' offices serving
districts with a population under 250,000
employed almost 26,000 staff, including
assistant prosecutors, paralegals, victim
advocates, investigators, and support staff. 
Attorneys (assistant prosecutors, civil
attorneys, and supervisory attorneys) and
support staff (administrative and clerical)
comprised two-thirds of total staff.  Victim
advocates made up 9% of total staff and
staff investigators 8%.

Over 8,200 assistant prosecutors including
supervisory attorneys were employed by
full-time offices serving districts with a
population under 250,000.  The number of
assistant prosecutors including supervisory
attorneys per 100,000 residents was 8.3.

Overall, the ratio of assistant prosecutors
(including supervisory attorneys) to
investigators was 4.1 attorneys to 1
investigator; to victim advocates, 3.6 to 1;
and support staff, 1 to 1.  Twenty-two
percent of the full-time offices serving
districts with a population under 250,000 did
not employ a full-time assistant prosecutor.

About 9% of the total staff worked part time. 
In full-time offices serving a district with a
population under 20,000, 19% of the total
staff worked part time, and in offices serving
a district with a population from 20,000 to
49,999, 14%.  The median total size for
full-time offices serving districts with a
population under 250,000 was 10, including
the chief prosecutor.

Half of the offices reported 3 or more
assistant prosecutors.  The median number
of support staff was 3 and of victim
advocates, 1. 

The median total staff varied considerably
by population.  The median total staff for
full-time offices serving a district with a
population between 100,000 and 249,999
was 31 compared to 15 for districts serving
a population between 50,000 and 99,999, 8
for districts serving a population between
20,000 and 49,999, and 4 for districts
serving a population under 20,000.

Term of office, length of service, 
and salary of full-time chief 
prosecutor

Most full-time chief prosecutors that served
a district with a population under 250,000
were elected or appointed to 4-year terms
(85%), with half serving 6.7 years or more
(not shown in a table).  Seven percent of the
full-time chief prosecutors were elected or
appointed to a 6-year term and 5%, a 2-year
term.

About a third of full-time chief prosecutors
serving a district with a population under
250,0000 served 4 years or less. 
Approximately 39% of the full-time chief
prosecutors representing a district with a
population under 20,000 had served 4 years
or less, compared to 22% representing a
district with a population between 100,000
and 249,999.  Nineteen percent of the
full-time chief prosecutors had served 15
years or more.  About 23% of the full-time
chief prosecutors in a district with 
population between 100,000 and 249,999 served 
15 years or more; 20% in a district with
population between 50,000 and 99,999;
17% in a district with population between
20,000 and 49,999; and 18% with a 
district with a population under 20,000.

Half of the full-time prosecutors' offices
serving districts with a population under
250,000 reported that the chief prosecutor
earned $90,000 or more per year.  The chief
prosecutor earned an annual salary of
$100,000 or more in 30% of the offices. 
Fifty-two percent of chief prosecutors
serving a district with a population between
100,000 and 249,999 earned $100,000 or
more, compared to 19% serving a district
with a population under 20,000.

Attorney recruitment and retention

Problems with recruiting new staff attorneys
were reported by a third of offices serving
districts with a population under 250,000
(not shown in a table).  Two-thirds of the
prosecutors' offices with recruitment
problems indicated that the primary obstacle
was noncompetitive salaries.  Problems with
recruiting new staff attorneys were cited
more often in offices serving a district with 
a population between 100,000 and 249,999
than their full-time counterparts serving a
lesser population. Three out of ten
prosecutors' offices serving districts with 
a population under 250,000 also reported
problems with retaining staff attorneys. 
Fifty-seven percent of the offices with
retention problems reported that the salary
level was the primary obstacle.  Retaining
staff members was cited more often as a
problem in offices serving a district with a
population between 100,000 and 249,999
than in the offices from districts with a 
smaller population.

Budget

In 2001 full-time offices serving districts 
with a population under 250,000 had combined
total budgets of over $1.1 billion for
prosecutorial functions.  More than half
(53%) of the $1.1 billion was for budgets in
the 335 offices serving a district with
population between 100,000 and 249,999. 
Half of the offices reported an annual budget
of $379,000 or more.  The median annual
budget for offices serving a district with a
population between 100,000 and 249,999
($1.4 million) was almost 10 times greater
than the median annual budget for offices
serving a district with a population under
20,000 ($150,000). 

Half of the full-time offices serving 
districts with a population under 250,000 
received 76% or more of their funding from 
the county government (not shown in a table). 
Six out of ten offices reported receiving
some portion of funding from their State
government.  Seven percent of the offices
reported 100% funding from their State
government.  

A quarter of the full-time prosecutors' 
offices serving districts under 250,000 
relied exclusively on the county government 
for their budget.  Forty-six percent of 
offices serving a district with a population 
under 20,000 received 100% of their funding 
from the county government, as did 25% of
offices serving a district with a population
between 20,000 and 49,999.  Fourteen percent 
of the offices reported no funding from the 
county government.

About 4% of full-time offices serving districts
with a population under 250,000 reported
some portion of funding from the city 
government and 38% funding from grant funds.

Types of cases handled
         
Full-time offices serving a district with a
population under 250,000 handled a variety
of felony matters. In addition to felony
cases, 90% of offices serving districts with a
population under 250,000 handled misdemeanor 
cases.  Juvenile matters were handled by 89%, 
traffic violations by 84%, and misdemeanor 
appeals by 73%.  About half of the offices 
serving districts with a population under 
250,000 represented the government in civil 
lawsuits (51%) and had jurisdiction over 
felony appeals (50%) and child support 
enforcement (49%).

Special categories of felony offenses
prosecuted

Over 90% of full-time offices serving districts
with a population under 250,000 reported
prosecuting domestic violence (97%) and
child abuse offenses (95%).  Firearm offenses 
were prosecuted by 87% of the offices, stalking 
by 63%, bank or thrift fraud by 47%, elder 
abuse by 42%, and health care fraud by 23%.  
Less than 10% of the full-time offices serving 
districts with a population under 250,000 
prosecuted telemarketing fraud (9%) or police 
excessive use of force (7%).

Computer-related crime prosecuted

Over the previous year, 4 out of 10 full-time
offices serving districts with a population
under 250,000 prosecuted computer-related
crime (felony or misdemeanor) under their
State's computer statutes. Computer-related
crimes were also handled by the relatively
small offices. Forty-one percent of full-time
offices serving a district with a population
between 20,000 and 49,999 reported
prosecuting computer-related offenses as
did 22% of offices serving a district with a
population under 20,000.  In terms of
specific computer-related crimes, 30% of the
offices indicated prosecuting transmitting
child pornography crimes; 28% credit card
fraud; 23% bank card fraud; and 17%
identity theft.  

Number of cases and convictions

Over 890,000 felony cases or 38% of all
felony cases nationwide were closed in
full-time offices serving districts with a
population under 250,000 during the 12
months preceding the survey (not shown in
a table).  These full-time offices also 
closed 2.8 million misdemeanor cases during 
this period.  

About 903 felony cases were closed per
100,000 residents.  Approximately 109
felony cases per assistant prosecutor were
closed.***Footnote 3: This estimate was
calculated by dividing the total number of
felony cases closed by the number of assistant
prosecutors including supervisory attorneys.
An assumption made in calculating the estimate
is that all assistant prosecutors handled 
felony cases, which may not always be the 
case.***  Staff from full-time offices serving
districts with a population under 250,000
participated in over 28,000 felony jury trials
that resulted in a verdict.

Half of the full-time offices serving districts
with a population under 250,000 closed 288
or more felony cases.  In at least half of the
offices, 90% or more of felony cases resulted 
in either a felony or misdemeanor conviction.  
There was a median of 10 felony jury trial 
verdicts per office in 2001. The median number 
of felony cases closed by offices serving a 
district with a population between 100,000 
and 249,999 was 3 times more than the median 
number of felony cases closed in offices 
serving a district with a population between 
50,000 and 99,999; 6 times more than the 
median number of felony cases closed in offices 
serving a district with a population between 
20,000 and 49,999, and 16 times the median
number of felony cases closed in offices
serving a district with a population under
20,000. 

Juveniles proceeded against in 
criminal courts

Over the 12 months preceding the survey, 
7 out of 10 full-time prosecutors' offices
serving districts with a population under
250,000 proceeded against juveniles in
criminal  court.  Over 15,000 juvenile cases
were handled in criminal court by full-time
prosecutors' offices serving districts with 
a population under 250,000, which represented 
almost half of the juvenile cases proceeded 
against in criminal court nationwide in the 
12 months preceding the survey.  Half of the 
offices proceeded against 5 or more juvenile 
cases.  

About 5% of the offices serving districts with
a population under 250,000 reported a
specialized unit for handling juvenile cases
in criminal court, and 41% reported
designated attorneys.  Written guidelines
about proceeding against juveniles in
criminal court were reported by 16% of
full-time prosecutors' offices serving 
districts with a population under 250,000.

Work-related threats or assaults 
against staff

Forty-one percent of full-time offices serving
districts with a population under 250,000
indicated that a staff member experienced a
work-related threat or assault.  Overall, a
third of full-time prosecutors' offices serving
districts with a population under 250,000
reported that the chief prosecutor was
threatened or assaulted.  Chief prosecutors
serving a district with a population between
50,000 and 99,999 had the highest percentage 
of work-related threats or assaults (37%).  
Assistant prosecutors were threatened or 
assaulted in 23% of full-time offices 
serving districts with a population under 
250,000, and staff investigators in 5%. 
 
Security measures

In general, 4 out of 10 full-time prosecutors'
offices serving districts with a population
under 250,000 reported they did not use
security measures (not shown in a table).

Electronic security systems were used by
22% of full-time offices serving districts 
with a population under 250,000; metal 
detectors or building guards by 20%; 
electronic surveillance by 12%; and police 
protection, by 10%. Two-thirds of offices 
serving a district with a population under 
20,000 reported employing no security 
measures. 

The chief prosecutor carried a firearm for
personal safety or security in 23% of
full-time offices serving districts with a
population under 250,000.  Twenty percent
of offices serving districts with a population
under 250,000 reported that an assistant
prosecutor carried a firearm for personal
safety, and 31% indicated a staff
investigator did so. 

DNA evidence

The use of DNA evidence was widespread
among full-time offices serving districts with
a population under 250,000.  During the 12
months before the survey, almost three-fourths 
of all full-time offices reported use of DNA 
evidence either during plea negotiations or 
felony trials.  Even 43% of full-time offices 
serving districts with a population under 
20,000 indicated the use of DNA evidence 
during plea negotiations or felony trials.  

Overall, full-time offices serving districts 
with a population under 250,000 used DNA
evidence more often in plea negotiations
(64%) than during felony trials (51%).  A
state-operated forensic laboratory performed 
the DNA analysis for 67% of the full-time 
offices serving districts with a population 
under 250,000, a privately operated forensic 
laboratory for 21%, the FBI for 7%, and a 
local agency for 2%.  The FBI was more likely 
to perform the DNA analysis for full-time 
offices serving a district with a population 
between 100,000 and 249,999 than for their 
full-time counterparts.***Footnote 4: For
more information on DNA laboratories, see
BJS report Survey of DNA Crime Laboratories,
2001, NCJ 179104.***

When asked about problems in the use of
DNA evidence, a third of the full-time offices
serving districts with a population under
250,000 reported at least one instance of
excessive delay in getting DNA results from
the laboratory.  About half of the full-time
offices serving a district with a population
between 100,000 and 249,999 and from
50,000 to 99,999 reported excessive delays
in getting DNA results from the laboratory. 
Other problems reported with the use of
DNA evidence included inconclusive DNA
results by 15% of the full-time offices and
improper collection of evidence by the police
by 6%. 
   
Community prosecution

Community prosecution has been defined
by prosecutors as a way to involve the
community to solve crime and coordinate
residents, local agencies, and organizations
to improve public safety and quality 
of life.***Footnote 5: For more information
on community prosecution see Elaine Nugent
and Gerard A. Rainville, "The State of
community Prosecution: Results from a
National Survey," The Prosecutor, March/
April 2001, pp. 26-33, and the Office of
Justice Programs website
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/prosecution/
commlinks.htm>.

During the previous year 68% of full-time
offices serving districts with a population
under 250,000 used tools other than
criminal prosecution to address community
problems; 55% involved the community to
identify crime and other problem areas; and
16% assigned prosecutors to specific
geographic areas.  A third of full-time offices
serving a district with population between
100,000 and 249,999 and a quarter serving
a district with a population between 50,000
and 99,999 assigned prosecutors to specific
geographic areas.

Almost all of the full-time offices serving
districts with a population under 250,000
had a formal or informal relationship with
law enforcement agencies.  Eighty-seven
percent reported a formal or informal
relationship with other governmental
agencies, 70% community associations, and
61% private organizations.

Seven out of ten full-time offices serving
districts with a population under 250,000
met regularly with school groups and
advocacy groups.  Half of the full-time
offices reported meeting regularly with 
youth service organizations and business 
groups.  Twenty-three percent of the offices 
indicated meeting regularly with religious 
groups and 6% tenant associations.  Assigning
prosecutors to handle community-related
activities was done by 22% of the full-time
offices serving districts with a population
under 250,000.

------------------------------------------
Prosecutors' offices with a part-time chief
prosecutor, 2001
 
*  In about 23% of the Nation's prosecutors' 
offices the chief prosecutor occupied a part-
time position. These offices served a population 
of almost 9.5 million, representing about 4% 
of the total U.S. population.  The median
population served per office was 9,589.

*  In 2001 the total workforce in offices with 
a part-time prosecutor was 2,699, which  
accounted for 3% of the total employment
for all prosecutors' offices in the country.

*  Forty percent of the staff in offices 
with a part-time prosecutor worked full 
time.

*  Half of the offices with a part-time
prosecutor employed 3 or more staff.

*  A total of 624 assistant prosecutors 
(including supervisory attorneys) were 
employed by part-time offices.  Eighty-
seven percent of these assistants were 
located in offices serving a district with 
a population of 10,000 or more.

*  Offices with a part-time prosecutor had
combined budgets for prosecutorial functions
totalling over $78 million. The median budget   
per office was $95,000.

*  Part-time prosecutors' offices closed over 
79,000 felony cases.  Nine out of ten of these
cases were closed in part-time offices serving 
a district with a population of 10,000 or more.

*  Staff from part-time offices were involved 
in approximately 2,100 jury trials that resulted 
in a verdict.  Half of the offices participated 
in 2 or more felony jury trials that ended with 
a verdict.

*  Nine out of ten part-time offices handled
domestic violence cases, eight out of ten child 
abuse cases, and six out of ten possession of 
an illegal firearm.

* Offices with a part-time prosecutor serving 
a district with a population under 10,000 were
more likely to handle misdemeanor appeals, 
felony appeals, traffic violations, juvenile 
matters and represent the government in civil
lawsuits than part-time offices serving a 
district with a population of 10,000 or more.

*  The median annual salary for part-time 
chief prosecutors serving a district with a 
population of 10,000 or more was $47,367
compared to $30,000 for those serving a 
district with a population under 10,000.

Methodology

Respondent selection
         
The 2001 National Survey of Prosecutors
(NSP) was a census of the 2,341 chief
prosecutors in the United States that
handled felony cases in State courts of
general jurisdiction.  In 2001 there were
2,341 prosecutorial districts in the Nation,
each with one chief prosecutor. The
prosecutor coordinator office in each State
was contacted and asked to provide the
names and addresses of all chief prosecutors 
in their State and the counties that these 
chief prosecutors served. 

Data collection

The data collection for the 2001 NSP was
conducted by the National Opinion
Research Center (NORC) through a mailed
questionnaire consisting of 35 questions 
on such topics as staffing, funding, special
categories of felony prosecutions, caseload,
juvenile matters, work-related threats or
assaults, DNA evidence, and community
related activities.  The 2001 NSP
questionnaire is available at the BJS
website 
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/nsp
01.pdf>. 

In May 2001 NORC mailed the 2001 NSP
questionnaire to the 114 prosecutors' offices
that served districts with a  population of
500,000 or more. The remaining 2,228
prosecutors' offices were sent questionnaires 
in June 2001. After the initial mailings, NORC 
engaged in an extensive follow-up to obtain a 
returned survey from each of the prosecutors' 
offices.  The follow-up process involved phone 
calls, e-mail communication, re-mailing
questionnaires, and sending follow-up letters. 
Staff of the National District Attorneys 
Associations as well as the Prosecutor 
Coordinator Office in each State also assisted 
NORC in providing follow-up.

NORC conducted additional telephone, fax,
and email follow-up on completed surveys to
obtain responses to unanswered items and
to clarify responses to other items. 

Survey response

Overall, 2,243 or 96% of the 2,341
prosecutors' offices nationwide responded
to the 2001 NSP.  The response rate for
full-time offices serving a district with 
a population under 250,000 was 97%.

Data imputations

Prior to doing imputations, data on the total
budget for prosecutorial functions for 2 of
the 56 nonrespondents for this report were
retrieved from a secondary source (for
example, office web page, telephoning the
county budget or treasurer's office) and
entered into the data set.  Similarly, data 
on the number of full-time assistant prosecutors
and the total number of full-time staff for 
2 of the 56 nonrespondents were collected from
a secondary source and entered into the
data set.  Since these data were retrieved
from proxy sources other than the prosecutors' 
offices, they were treated as imputed data.

The simple hot deck method, in which a
value was copied from a donor case having
similar values or related variables, to impute
various variables for the 2001 NSP.  Initially,
the number of full-time chief prosecutors,
the number of part-time chief prosecutors,
the number of part-time assistant prosecutors, 
the total number of part-time staff, and the 
number of various full-time and part-time staff 
members (for example, investigators, victim 
advocate, support staff)were imputed for 56 
prosecutors' offices; the number of full-time 
assistant prosecutors and the number of full-
time staff for 54 offices; the total budget for 
prosecutorial function for 83 offices; and the 
number of felony cases closed for 192 offices.

To impute any variable by the hot deck
method, the prosecutorial district size was
used to sort the completed cases (such as
prosecutor office surveys) in descending
order.  A missing value for each variable
was imputed as the value of the variable on
the case immediately preceding the case
with missing data.  For example, a missing
value for felony cases closed was imputed
as the value of felony cases closed on the
case that immediately proceeded the case
with missing data. 

For the 56 prosecutors' offices where the
full-time or part-time status of the chief
prosecutor was imputed, BJS staff verified
this information with the prosecutor
coordinator's office in  States where the 
56 offices were located.
