Introduction

Punitive damages are awarded when the defendant's conduct is determined to
have been so "willful, malicious, or fraudulent" that it exceeds the legal
criteria for mere or gross negligence. Punitive damages typically involve
awards over and above the compensatory damage award. In such cases, unlike
other forms of damage relief afforded to plaintiffs, punitive damages
serve as a means for "punishing the defendant" and "deterring others" from
committing actions similar to the defendant's conduct (Black's Law 
Dictionary, Prosser & Keeton Torts, 5th Edition, 1984).

This report focuses on general civil (tort, contract, and real property) 
bench and jury trials that produced a punitive damage award in the Nation's 
75 most populous counties in 2001.

Types of civil cases receiving punitive damages

*  In 2001, 6%, or 356, of the 6,504 civil trials with plaintiff winners in
State courts in the Nation's 75 largest counties resulted in punitive damage
awards.

*  The types of tort cases in which plaintiff winners were most likely to
receive punitive damages included slander/libel (58%), intentional torts
(36%), and false arrest/imprisonment(26%)cases.

*  Contract cases with the highest percentage of plaintiff winners awarded
punitive damages included partnership disputes (22%), employment
discrimination (18%), and fraud (17%)cases.

Punitive damage award amounts 

*  Plaintiff winners received $50,000 or more in punitive damages in half of
the estimated 356 civil trials concluded in 2001 with punitive damage awards. 
 
*  41 trials, or 12%, of the 356 civil trials with punitive damages, had
punitive damage awards that equaled or surpassed $1 million. In 9 of these 
356 civil trials, the punitive awards totaled $10 million or more.

*  The median award for the 138 contract trials with punitive damages was
$83,000; in comparison, the 217 tort trials with punitive damages garnered
median damages of $25,000.

Comparing compensatory to punitive damages 

*  Punitive damages exceeded compensatory awards in 39% of the 356 civil
trials with punitive damages. 

*  Punitive awards exceeded compensatory awards in 40% of the 217 tort trials
and in 38% of the 138 contract trials in which a plaintiff received punitive
damages.

*  Punitive damages were more than 4 times greater than the compensatory
awards in 17 intentional tort trials,10 slander/libel trials, and 7 
automobile trials. Each of these tort case types had median compensatory
awards that were under $40,000.  

Punitive damages in jury and bench trials

*  Plaintiffs who prevailed in civil trials concluded in 2001 received
punitive damages in 6% of jury trials and 4% of bench trials.

*  The median punitive damage awards for plaintiff winners did not differ
significantly between civil jury ($50,000) and bench ($46,000) trials.

*  Of the 260 jury trials in which a plaintiff winner was awarded punitive
damages, 14% resulted in a punitive award verdict of $1 million or more.
Punitive damages of $1 million or more were awarded in 2% of the 79 bench
trials with punitive damages.

Litigant pairings in punitive damage cases

*  The two most common types of litigant pairings in civil trials with
punitive awards involved individuals suing either other individuals (44%) 
or businesses (30%).

*  In over 80% of the 217 tort trials in which plaintiffs won punitive
damages, the plaintiffs were individuals  suing other individuals (59%) 
or businesses (26%). 

*  In nearly a third of the 138 contract trials in which plaintiff winners
were awarded punitive damages, the plaintiffs were businesses who had either
successfully sued other businesses (19%) or individuals (13%). 

Post trial activity in civil trials with punitive damages
 
*  Plaintiffs filed motions for post trial relief in 11% of civil trials
in which punitive damages were awarded, while defendants requested post 
trial relief in 40% of civil trials with punitive damages.

*  Motions for new trials or award modifications were the most common types 
of post trial relief sought by plaintiff winners receiving punitive damages. 

*  Among cases in which the defendant sought post trial relief in light of a
punitive damage award, a new trial was the most common form of relief sought.

*  The courts granted relief in 47% of the 36 civil trials where plaintiffs
sought to have their damage award increased or modified in some way.
 
*  Post trial relief was granted to about 28% of the 138 defendants who 
sought to modify a trial with a punitive damage award. In nearly half of 
these trials (49%), the relief granted was in the form of an award
modification.

Notice of appeals in civil trials with punitive damages

*  Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to an intermediate appellate court 
or State court of last resort in 7%, or 26, of the 354 civil trials in 
which they won punitive damages. 

*  Defendants filed a notice of appeal in nearly a third (30%) of the 354
civil trials where the prevailing plaintiff was awarded punitive damages.
Defendants appealed 22% of tort trials and 41% of contract trials that had 
a plaintiff winner receiving punitive damages.

Trends in punitive damage awards in civil jury trials,
1992-2001

*  The percentage of general civil jury trials with plaintiff winners in the
Nation's 75 largest counties that produced a punitive damage award was the
same in 1992 (6%) and 2001 (6%). 

* Plaintiff winners garnered punitive damage awards at similar rates in tort
jury trials during the 1992 (4%) and 2001 (5%)study periods. In contract jury
trials, the percentage of plaintiff winners who received a punitive damage
award has declined slightly from 13% in 1992 to 10% in 2001.

*  The median punitive damage awards in civil jury trials was $63,000 in 1992
and $50,000 in 2001.

*  The percentages of plaintiff winners in civil jury trials awarded punitive
damages of $1 million or more in 1992 (12%) and 2001 (14%) were not
significantly different.

*  In 1992 punitive awards exceeded compensatory awards in 43% of the 364
civil jury trials in which a plaintiff winner was awarded punitive damages. 
In 2001 punitive awards were greater than compensatory awards in 41% of the
260 civil jury trials with punitive damages.
