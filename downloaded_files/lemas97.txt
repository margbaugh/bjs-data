Highlights

As of June 1997, there were more than 700 general purpose State
and local law enforcement agencies with 100 or more full-time
sworn personnel that included 50 or more uniformed officers
responding to calls for service.  These larger agencies
collectively employed about 381,000 full-time sworn personnel,
including about 226,000 officers assigned to respond to calls
for service.

Nearly all of these agencies provided data in response to the
1997 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics
(LEMAS) survey sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. 
Included among these respondents were 454 municipal police
departments, 167 county sheriffs' departments, 30 county police
departments, and the 49 primary State law enforcement agencies
operating in each State except Hawaii.  

Personnel

In 1997 the Nation's larger municipal police departments
employed an average of 23 full-time officers per 10,000 city
residents.  Larger county police and sheriffs' departments
employed 13 and 12 officers per 10,000 county residents,
respectively.  The 49 primary State police agencies employed an
average of about 2 officers per 10,000 State residents.   

From 1993 to 1997 the median agency increase in number of
full-time sworn personnel was 13% among sheriffs' departments, 9%
among county and municipal police departments, and 4% among
State police agencies.   

Among county and municipal police departments, an average of 90%
of the sworn personnel worked in field operations, and an
average of 63% were uniformed officers with regular duties that
included responding to calls for service.     

In sheriffs' departments a smaller average percentage of
officers worked in field operations (57%) and responded to calls
for service (42%) because more officers were assigned to
jail-related (27%) and court-related (8%) duties.  Across all
types of agencies, an average of 5% of sworn personnel worked in
administration, and 3% in technical support.

Sheriffs' departments (15%) employed a higher average percentage
of female officers than county (11%), municipal (9%), or State
(5%) police agencies.  The average percentage of sworn personnel
who were members of a racial or ethnic minority was 23% for
county police departments, 19% for municipal police departments,
17% for sheriffs' departments, and 12% for State police
agencies. 

Nearly all law enforcement agencies with 100 or more officers
screened applicants for sworn positions by means of a personal
interview, background investigation, criminal record check,
driving record check, and a medical exam.  About 9 in 10
required psychological testing and a written aptitude exam. 
More than 4 in 5 required applicants to take a drug test, and
nearly two-thirds administered a polygraph exam to applicants.

Nearly all of the 49 primary State police agencies (92%) had
some type of residency requirement for new officers.  About
three-fifths of local law enforcement agencies with 100 or more
officers had a residency requirement.   

In 1997, 16% of State police agencies required a 2-year college
degree, and  4% required a 4-year degree.  County police were the
next most likely to require either a 2-year (13%) or 4-year (3%)
degree.  Among large municipal police agencies, 9% had a degree
requirement, with 2% requiring a 4-year degree.  Among sheriffs'
departments, 6% required a degree, including 1% with a 4-year
degree requirement.

officers to have a 2-year or 4-year college degree, 
1993 and 1997

Local        6.3%    8.6%
State       14.3%   20.4%


The median number of hours of classroom training required of new
officers was highest in State police agencies (823), and lowest
in sheriffs' departments (448).  The requirements for county and
municipal police were 760 and 640 hours, respectively.  The
median field training hours required was 480 hours for county
and municipal police, 436 for sheriffs' departments, and 360 for
State police.

Community policing

Thanks to the support of the Department of Justice's Office of
Community Oriented Policing Services, the 1997 LEMAS survey was
the first in the series to collect data on agency policies and
practices as they relate to community policing.  A majority of
the Nation's larger county (63%) and municipal (61%) police
agencies reported they had a formally written community policing
plan, compared to fewer than half of sheriffs' departments (38%) 
and State police agencies (33%).

About four-fifths of larger county (80%) and municipal (79%)
police departments had full-time community policing officers,
with an average of 20 such officers each.  Among larger
sheriffs' departments, two-thirds had full-time community policing
officers, with an average of 11 each.

About three-fourths of larger county (77%) and municipal (74%)
police agencies operated one or more community substations
during 1997, as did about two-thirds of sheriffs' departments
(66%), and two-fifths of State police agencies (39%).    

In a large majority of municipal (80%) and county (73%) police
departments with 100 or more officers, all new officer recruits
received community policing training.  This was true in less
than half of larger sheriffs' departments (49%) and State police
agencies (41%).  In the majority of these latter two types of
agencies, however, at least some recruits received such training.  

A large percentage of the municipal police (91%), county police
(83%), and sheriffs' (79%) departments with 100 or more officers
trained at least some of their in-service officers in community
policing.  Most State police agencies (57%) did so as well.

Two-thirds of larger local law enforcement agencies offered
community policing training to citizens, compared to about a
fourth of State agencies. 

During the 12-month period ending June 30, 1997, nearly two-thirds
of larger local law enforcement agencies (65%) formed
problem-solving partnerships with community groups, local
agencies, or others through written agreements.  A majority
(55%) also actively encouraged patrol officers to engage in
problem solving projects that utilized community policing
concepts.

Nearly all larger local law enforcement agencies met with
community groups during the 12-month period ending June 30, 1997.
The largest percentages met with neighborhood associations
(96%), school groups (88%), and business groups (82%).  Many
also met with tenants' associations (70%), youth service
organizations (67%), advocacy groups (61%), and religious groups
(61%).  Nearly half surveyed citizens regarding their
satisfaction with police services (49%) and their perceptions of
crime problems (44%).

Operations

All State and local law enforcement agencies with 100 or more
officers used automobiles for routine patrol during 1997.  A
majority of municipal police departments also used bicycle
(76%), motorcycle (68%), and foot (55%) patrol routinely.  A
majority of county police departments used motorcycle (63%) and
bicycle (57%) patrol.    

The average percentage of all patrol units that were deployed in
automobiles ranged from 97% in State police agencies to 84% for
municipal police.   Municipal police departments used the most
motorcycle (5%), bicycle (5%) and foot (4%) patrol units.  The
use of foot and bike units was greater in 1997 than in 1993 for
municipal police, county police, and sheriffs' departments.

Graph: Average percent of patrol units that were on foot or bicycles,
1993 and 1997

               1993     1997
Sheriff         1%       4%
County          2%       5%
Municipal       7%       9%


More than three-fourths of the Nation's larger municipal police
(85%), county police (80%), and sheriffs' (75%) departments
participated in an enhanced (or expanded) 9-1-1 system in 1997. 
From 1993 to 1997, the overall percentage of larger local law
enforcement agencies with enhanced 9-1-1 increased from 77% to
83%.  

In addition to responding to citizen calls for service, all but
a few of the municipal, county, and State police agencies with
100 or more officers also handled the enforcement of traffic
laws and the investigation of traffic accidents.  Most sheriffs'
departments enforced traffic laws (88%) and investigated
accidents (75%) as well. 

About 9 in 10 large local law enforcement agencies and 3 in 4
State agencies performed Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT)
operations.  A majority of sheriffs' departments had
responsibility for search and rescue (75%) and underwater
recovery (62%), and about half handled bomb disposal (49%). 
Most county police agencies handled bomb disposal (60%) and
search and rescue (53%) and nearly half were responsible for
underwater recovery (43%).  Nearly half of State police agencies
performed search and rescue (47%) and bomb disposal (45%). 

A large percentage of county (93%) and municipal (82%) police
agencies with 100 or more officers operated a full-time drug
enforcement unit.  About two-thirds of sheriffs' departments
(69%) and State police agencies (65%) operated such a unit.

About three-fourths of county police (77%), municipal police
(76%), and sheriffs' (75%) departments participated in a
multi-agency drug enforcement task force during 1997, as did
about half of the State police agencies.  More than 90% of the
agencies of each type had receipts from a drug asset forfeiture
program during fiscal 1997. 

Nearly all sheriffs' departments with 100 or more officers
performed court-related functions such as executing arrest
warrants (98%), providing court security (93%) and serving civil
process (93%).  Nearly all municipal police (93%) and county
police (87%) also executed arrest warrants.


About 5 in 6 sheriffs' departments with 100 or more officers
operated at least 1 jail facility during 1997, as did about 1 in
4 municipal police departments. Just one county police agency
and no State police agencies operated a jail.  

A majority of larger county police (80%), municipal police
(72%), and sheriffs' (56%) departments operated at least one
temporary holding (lockup) facility separate from a jail. 
Eighteen percent of State police agencies operated a lockup
facility.  

Expenditures and pay

During fiscal 1997, the median total operating expenditure per
employee in  law enforcement agencies with 100 or more officers
was $56,800 for State police, $55,500 for county police, $54,000
for municipal police, and $49,200 for sheriffs' departments. 
When only sworn personnel are included, the medians were $82,600
for State police, $77,500 for sheriffs' departments, $73,500 for
county police, and $70,700 for municipal police.   

The mean starting salary for entry level officers was highest in
municipal police agencies ($29,859), followed by county police
($27,901), State police ($26,877), and sheriffs' departments
($25,994).  Officer salaries increased by an average of about
10% after 1 year of experience.

A majority of large municipal police (72%) and sheriffs' (62%)
departments authorized educational incentive pay for officers,
compared to 40% of county police and 20% of State police. 
County police were the most likely to authorize shift
differential pay (63%), merit pay (60%), and hazardous duty pay
(47%).

Equipment

State police agencies operated an average of 102 cars per 100
officers.  Among local agencies, county police operated an
average of 81 cars per 100 officers, compared to 60 per 100 for
sheriffs' departments and 57 per 100 for municipal police.   

Eighty-six percent of State law enforcement agencies operated at
least one airplane.  This was a much higher percentage than for
sheriffs' (27%), county police (20%) or municipal police (6%)
departments. 

About two-thirds of State law enforcement agencies (69%) operated
at least one helicopter.  This was also a higher percentage than
for county police (47%), sheriffs' (39%), or municipal police
(14%) departments.  

Sheriffs' departments (76%) were about twice as likely as county
(40%) or State (37%) police agencies to use boats and about 3
times as likely as municipal police (26%) to do so.  

All but a few of the State and local law enforcement agencies
with 100 or more officers authorized their officers to use 
semiautomatic sidearms.  About two thirds of the State police
agencies authorized the .40-caliber version and about half the
9mm.   More than two-thirds of municipal police (74%), sheriffs'
(69%) and county police (67%) departments authorized 9mm
semiautomatic sidearms.  A majority of sheriffs' departments
also authorized their officers to use .40-caliber semiautomatic
sidearms.

About two-fifths of larger sheriffs' (41%) and municipal police
(39%) departments required all field officers to wear body armor
compared to about a fourth of State and county police agencies.  

The use of batons was authorized by all but a few agencies, with
the collapsible variety the most likely to be authorized by both
State (78%) and local (71%) agencies.  Pepper spray was also a
widely authorized type of nonlethal weapon, with over 90% of the
agencies of each type allowing for its use.  For each agency
type, this was an increase over 1993 levels.


Percent of law enforcement agencies authorizing the use 
of pepper spray, 1993 and 1997

Local          69%      92%
State          63       94


After batons and pepper spray, flash/bang grenades were the next
most authorized nonlethal weapons, with 73% of local and 59% of
State law enforcement agencies authorizing them. 

About three-fourths of State police agencies used video cameras
in at least some patrol cars during 1997, as did a majority of
larger sheriffs' (57%) and county (53%) police agencies. 
Municipal police departments (41%) were the least likely to be
using in-car video cameras.  

About two-thirds of State police agencies (69%) were using tire
deflation spikes in 1997.  Among local law enforcement agencies
with 100 or more officers, nearly half of sheriffs' departments
(47%) used them compared to about a fourth of county (27%) and
municipal (22%) police departments.  

Nearly three-fifths of larger county police agencies (57%) were
using stolen vehicle tracking devices, compared to about a third
of municipal police (35%) and a fifth of sheriffs' and State
police agencies.

Computers and information systems 

More than 90% of State police agencies used some type of mobile
computer or digital terminal in 1997, as did 78% of larger local
law enforcement agencies.  Laptops were used by a majority of
both State (88%) and local (62%) agencies.  Car-mounted digital
terminals were used by about half of municipal police agencies
compared to about a third of other agencies.

During 1997 the Nation's larger law enforcement agencies
primarily used paper reports to transmit field report data to
their central information system. Some State police (10%),
municipal police (8%), and sheriffs' (7%) departments used
computer methods such as diskette transfer or laptop downloads.  

In about half of larger local law enforcement agencies and a
third of State agencies, at least some officers had direct
computer access to vehicle and driving records while in the
field.  In more than a fourth of larger local law enforcement
agencies, at least some officers in the field had direct
computer access to criminal history (28%) and calls for service
(27%) information.   

About half of larger local law enforcement agencies used digital
imaging for mug shots during 1997, including 68% of sheriffs'
departments.  Fifty percent of county police departments used
digital imaging for suspect composites, as did 41% of sheriffs'
departments and 30% of municipal police departments.

A majority of State and local law enforcement agencies with 100
or more officers either owned or had access to an Automated
Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS).  This included
four-fifths of county police agencies and nearly three-fourths of
sheriffs' departments.

Three-fifths of larger local law enforcement agencies used
computers for crime mapping during 1997. Nearly half were
geocoding and mapping incident (49%) and calls for service (44%)
data. More than a third were geocoding and mapping arrest data
(36%). 

More than three-fourths of larger local law enforcement agencies
maintained computerized files on calls for service (94%),
arrests (93%), incident reports (88%), evidence (81%), criminal
histories (78%), and warrants (77%).  

Policies and programs 

All local law enforcement agencies with 100 or more officers had
written policies pertaining to the use of deadly force.  In
addition, nearly all had directives on employee conduct and
appearance (99%), handling juveniles (97%), less-than-lethal force (97%), 
citizen complaints (96%), domestic disputes (96%), and off-duty 
employment (95%).  

All State law enforcement agencies had written directives on
deadly force, employee conduct and appearance, and off-duty
employment, and 94% had directives pertaining to citizen
complaints and less-than-lethal force.

A majority of both State and local agencies had written
directives on discretionary arrest powers, employee counseling,
maximum work hours for officers, handling mentally ill persons,
and strip searches.

All but a few of the State and local law enforcement agencies
with 100 or more officers had a written policy pertaining to
vehicle pursuits.  Both local (82%) and State (59%) agencies
were most likely to have a policy that restricted vehicle pursuits 
by specific criteria such as type of offense or speed.  State agencies 
(37%) were more likely than local ones (10%) to have a policy that 
leaves pursuit decisions to the officer's discretion.  In a small 
percentage of municipal police (4%) and sheriffs' (3%) departments,
the official agency policy discouraged all vehicle pursuits.

Many larger local law enforcement agencies operated special
units with personnel assigned full-time to address specific
community problems.  Four-fifths had a full-time unit for drug
education in schools, and more than half operated a unit to deal
with juvenile delinquency (61%) and gang (53%) problems.  Nearly
half had full-time special units for child abuse (49%) and
domestic violence (43%).

Foreword

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) began the Law Enforcement
Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) program in 1987
with a nationwide survey of the Nation's State and local law
enforcement agencies.  Updated versions of the survey were
completed in 1990, 1993, and 1997.  The current volume presents
1997 data provided by 700 State and local law enforcement
agencies employing 100 or more full-time officers.  As in the
1993 volume, sections on personnel, expenditures and pay,
operations, equipment, computers and information systems, and
policies and programs are included.  

This volume marks the first time a specific community policing
section has been included, with the survey questions developed
and administered through funding from the Office of Community
Oriented Policing Services (COPS).  An outgrowth of the ongoing
collaboration between BJS and COPS, the 1997 LEMAS survey is
expected to be instrumental in assessing the state of law
enforcement, specifically community policing, in the United
States.  

Since the advent of the 1994 Violent Crime Act, the COPS Office
has been tasked with the goal of funding 100,000 new officers by
the year 2000 and advancing community policing nationwide. 
Towards this end, the COPS Office created numerous grant
programs to fund the hiring of additional police officers and to
help promote the practice of community policing.  The inclusion
of community policing questions in the 1997 LEMAS survey,
therefore, is but one step in assessing the potential impact
these programs may have had directly or indirectly on law
enforcement agencies across the country.

We are pleased to present you with the results of the 1997 LEMAS
survey, which includes the new community policing questions, and
hope that the information gleaned from these data will help
further our knowledge of law enforcement as it exists today.  In
addition, we hope the results of the survey will provide law
enforcement agencies an opportunity to assess their progress in
community policing relative to that of comparable jurisdictions
and the profession as a whole.  In closing, we gratefully
acknowledge the participation of those agencies that have given
us a glimpse into their law enforcement practices and hope that
this information will be of use to them and the communities they
serve.

Introduction

The 1997 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) survey included all State and local agencies
employing 100 or more full-time sworn personnel as reported in a
BJS census of State and local law enforcement agencies conducted
in 1996.  The survey also included a nationally representative
sample of agencies that employed fewer than 100 officers.  These
smaller agencies received a shorter version of the survey
questionnaire that was sent to the larger agencies.

The initial mailing of the LEMAS questionnaire was conducted in
July 1997.  The reference date for all personnel-related
questions was the pay period that included June 30, 1997.  For
other questions it was June 30, 1997 unless otherwise indicated.
The data were collected by the Bureau of the Census for BJS.

A total of 3,597 agencies received the 1997 LEMAS questionnaire,
and 3,412 (95%) responded.  Of the 968 agencies with 100 or more
officers that received the survey, 909 (94%) responded.  This
was the fourth survey in the LEMAS program with previous data
collections occurring in 1987, 1990, and 1993.  

Overview of this volume

This volume presents individual agency data for 700 larger State
and local law enforcement agencies that responded to the 1997
LEMAS survey.  Agencies with special geographic jurisdictions
such as university campuses, public school districts,
transportation systems, parks and recreation facilities,
airports, waterways, public housing, or State government
buildings are excluded.  Agencies with special enforcement
responsibilities such as natural resource and conservation laws,
alcohol control laws, or agricultural laws are also excluded. 

The volume includes the 49 primary State law enforcement
agencies operating in each State except Hawaii.  (The Hawaii
Department of Public Safety primarily performs court-related
duties.)

General purpose local law enforcement agencies that responded to
the LEMAS survey are included as long as they met the following
criteria: 

     1.  Employment of 100 or more full-time sworn officers as of
June 1996 (reference month for the 1996 agency census).

     2.  Employment of 100 or more full-time sworn officers as of
June 1997 (reference month for the 1997 LEMAS survey.

     3.  Employment of 50 or more full-time uniformed sworn
officers with regular assigned duties that included responding
to calls for service as of June 1997.

A total of 651 local law enforcement agencies are included. 
This includes 30 county police departments, 454 municipal police
departments, and 167 sheriffs' departments and offices.  Local
agencies from every State except Maine, North Dakota, Vermont,
and Wyoming are included.  These States had no local agencies
that met the above requirements for inclusion. 

Organization of data tables 

A summary of the number and type of agencies from each State is 
in Table A. 

Table B lists the State and local law enforcement agencies
employing 1,000 or more full-time sworn personnel that included
500 or more uniformed officers whose regular assigned duties
included responding to calls for service.  These are the
agencies with the largest number of sworn personnel providing
direct law enforcement services.

Table C presents summary data, by type of agency, for the
variables that are included in the individual agency tables that
follow.  The reader should refer to the notes in the
corresponding individual data agency tables when using data from
table C.

Following the 3 summary data tables are tables containing
individual data for State and local law enforcement agencies
with 100 or more officers.  The 26 tables for local agencies are
presented first as tables 1a through 26a.  Following local agency
tables are tables 1b through 26b covering the State agencies.  


Local agencies are listed alphabetically by State and county. 
Within each county, the county sheriffs' department or county
police department is listed first, if applicable.   These are
followed, in alphabetical order, by the municipal police
agencies operating within that county.  

The reader should refer to the note following each table for the
explanation of symbols and codes as well as other important
information.  A triple dash ("---") is used in all tables to
indicate that a particular data item was not provided by an
agency.  

The rest of this 320-page book is tables and questionnaire.
