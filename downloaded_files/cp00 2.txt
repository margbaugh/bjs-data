------------------------------------------------------

Fourteen States executed 85 prisoners
during 2000.  The number executed was
13 fewer than in 1999.  Those executed
during 2000 had been under sentence of
death an average of 11 years and 5
months, 6 months less than that for
inmates executed in 1999.

At yearend 2000, 3,593 prisoners were
under sentence of death.  California held
the largest number on death row (586),
followed by Texas (450), Florida, (371),
and Pennsylvania (238).  Eighteen people
were under a Federal death sentence.

During 2000, 27 States and the Federal
prison system received 214 prisoners
under sentence of death.  Texas (34
admissions), California (31), Florida 
(20),North Carolina (18), and 
Pennsylvania (12) accounted for more 
than half of those sentenced in 2000.

During 2000, 83 men and 2 women were
executed: 49 whites, 35 blacks, and 1
American Indian.  The executed inmates
included 6 Hispanics (all white).  
Eighty of the executions were carried 
out by lethal injection and 5 by 
electrocution.

From January 1, 1977, to December 31,
2000, 683 executions took place in 31
States.  Sixty-five percent of the
executions occurred in 5 States: Texas
(239), Virginia (81), Florida (50), 
Missouri (46), and Oklahoma (30).  

Capital punishment laws

At yearend 2000 the death penalty was
authorized by 38 States and the Federal
Government.  During 2000 no State
enacted new legislation authorizing 
capital punishment.

Statutory changes

During 2000, 5 States revised statutory
provisions relating to the death penalty.
Most of the changes involved additional
aggravating circumstances and procedural 
amendments.

By State, the changes were as follows:

Colorado -- Added as an aggravating
factor use of a weapon during a Class 
1 felony when use of the weapon itself
constituted a felony under State or
Federal law (CRS 16-11-103(5)(o)),
effective 8/2/2000.

Florida -- Authorized lethal injection 
as a method of execution, effective 
1/14/2000. An inmate may elect in writing 
to be executed by electrocution within 30 
days of the effective date or the date of
sentence; if this option is waived, the
method shall be lethal injection (FSA sec.
922.105).

Georgia -- Revised the penal code to
allow for lethal injection as the method 
of execution for all inmates sentenced 
to death for crimes committed on or a
fter May 1, 2000; those whose offenses
occurred before that date shall be
executed by electrocution, effective
5/1/2000 (O.C.G.A. 17-10-38). 

Mississippi -- Revised the definition 
of capital murder to include among peace
officers who were murdered victims
conservation officers (was previously
called "game warden") (Miss. Code Ann
sec. 97-3-19(2)(a)), effective 
 4/30/2000. 

Mississippi also amended the code of
criminal procedure setting a time 
limit of 1 year within which a defendant 
must apply for post-conviction relief. 
Upon exhaustion of appeals or failure to 
file for post-conviction relief in the 
allotted time, any stays of execution 
will be vacated and an execution date 
will be set (Miss. Code Ann. sec. 
99-19-106), effective 7/1/2000. 

New Jersey -- Revised the penal code 
to create a mandatory sentence to life
without the possibility of parole or
commutation for offenders convicted of 
a capital offense but not sentenced to 
death (NJSA 2C:11-3b(4)), effective
8/22/2000. 

Automatic review

Of the 38 States with capital statutes at
yearend, 37 provided for review of all
death sentences regardless of the defendant's 
wishes.  In South Carolina the defendant 
had the right to waive sentence review if 
he or she was deemed competent by the 
court (State v. Torrence, 473 S.E. 3d 703 
(S.C. 1996)).  Federal death penalty 
procedures did not provide for automatic 
review after a sentence of death had been 
imposed.

The State's highest appellate court usually
conducted the review.  If either the
conviction or sentence were vacated, the
case could be remanded to the trial court
for additional proceedings or retrial.  
As a result of retrial or resentencing, 
a death sentence could be reimposed. 

While most of the 37 States authorized an
automatic review of both the conviction
and sentence, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky,
Oklahoma, and Tennessee required review 
of the sentence only. In Idaho review of 
the conviction had to be filed through 
appeal or forfeited. In Indiana and 
Kentucky a defendant could waive review 
of the conviction.

In Virginia a defendant could waive an
appeal of trial court error but could not
waive review of the death sentence for
arbitrariness and proportionality. In
Mississippi the question of whether the
defendant could waive the right to
automatic review had not been addressed. 
In Wyoming neither statute nor case law 
precluded a waiver of appeal.

In Arkansas case law held that the supreme 
court review the trial court record for 
error in capital cases (State v. Robbins, 
339 Ark. 379, 5 S.W. 3d 51 (1999)). Such 
a review is independent of a defendant's 
right to waive appeals.

Method of execution

As of December 31, 2000, lethal injection
was the predominant method of execution 
(36 States).

Eleven States authorized electrocution; 4
States, lethal gas; 3 States, hanging; and
3 States, firing squad.

Eighteen States authorized more than 1
method -- lethal injection and an
alternative method -- generally at the
election of the condemned prisoner;
however, 6 of these 18 stipulated which
method must be used, depending on the
date of sentencing; 1 authorized hanging
only if lethal injection could not be 
given; and if lethal injection is ever 
ruled to be unconstitutional, 1 authorized 
lethal gas, and 1 authorized electrocution.

The Federal Government authorizes the
method of execution under two different
laws.  Offenses prosecuted under 28 CFR, 
Part 26, mandate lethal injection, while 
those prosecuted under the Violent Crime 
Control Act of 1994 (18 U.S.C. 3596) 
call for the method of the State in 
which the conviction took place.

Minimum age

In 2000 seven jurisdictions did not 
specify a minimum age for which the 
death penalty could be imposed.  

In some States the minimum age was set
forth in the statutory provisions that
determine the age at which a juvenile 
may be transferred to adult court for 
trial as an adult.  Fourteen States and 
the Federal system required a minimum 
age of 18. Seventeen States indicated 
an age of eligibility between 14 and 
17. 

Characteristics of prisoners under
sentence of death at yearend 2000

Thirty-seven States and the Federal
prison system held a total of 3,593
prisoners under sentence of death on
December 31, 2000, an increase of 53, 
or 1.5% more than at the end of 1999.

The Federal prison system count
remained unchanged at 18.  Three States
reported 39% of the Nation's death row
population: California (586), Texas 
(450), and Florida (371).  Of the 39 
jurisdictions with death penalty statutes 
enacted during 2000, New Hampshire had 
no one under a capital sentence, and 
Kansas, South Dakota,  and Wyoming had 
4 or fewer.

Among the 38 jurisdictions with prisoners
under sentence of death at yearend 2000,
20 had more inmates than a year earlier,
5 had fewer inmates, and 13 had the same 
number.  California had an increase of 30, 
followed by North Carolina (13). Oklahoma 
and Texas had the largest decreases (12 
and 10, respectively).

During 2000 the number of white inmates
under sentence of death rose by 30; the
number of blacks increased by 20; and
the number of persons of other races 
rose from 65 to 68.

The number of Hispanics under sentence
of death rose from 326 to 339 during
2000. Twenty-five Hispanics were
received under sentence of death, 6 
were removed from death row, and 6 
were executed.  Nearly three-quarters 
of the Hispanics were held in 3 States: 
California (114), Texas (101), and 
Florida (32).

During 2000 the number of women sentenced 
to be executed increased from 51 to 54.  
Nine women were received under sentence 
of death, 3 were removed from death row, 
and 2 were executed.  

Women were under sentence of death in
18 States.  More than half of women on
death row at yearend were in California,
Texas, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.

under sentence of death.  Whites
comprised 55%; blacks comprised 43%;
and other races (1.9%) included 29
American Indians, 27 Asians, and 12

Among inmates under sentence of death on 
December 31, 2000, for whom information 
on education was available, three-fourths 
had either completed high school (38%) 
or finished 9th, 10th, or 11th grade (37%). 
The percentage who had not gone beyond 
eighth grade (14%) was larger than that 
of inmates who had attended some college 
(10%). The median level of education was 
the 11th grade.  

Of inmates under a capital sentence and
with reported marital status, more than
half had never married; more than a fifth
were married at the time of sentencing;
and more than a fifth were divorced,
separated, or widowed.

Among all inmates under sentence of death 
for whom date of arrest information was 
available, about half were age 20 to 29 
at the time of arrest for their capital
offense; 13% were age 19 or younger;
and less than 1% were age 55 or older. 
The average age at time of arrest was 28
years.  On December 31, 2000, 36% of all
inmates were age 30 to 39, and 68% were
age 25 to 44.  The youngest offender
under sentence of death was 18; the
oldest was 85.

Entries and removals of persons 
under sentence of death

Between January 1 and December 31,2000, 
25 State prison systems reported
receiving 212 prisoners under sentence 
of death;the Federal Bureau of Prisons
received 2 inmates. More than half of 
the inmates were received in 5 States: 
Texas (34), California (31), Florida 
(20), North Carolina (18), and 
Pennsylvania (12).

All 214 prisoners who were received
under sentence of death had been
convicted of murder. By gender and 
race, 115 were white men, 85 were black 
men, 1 was an American Indian man,4 
were Asian men, 7 were white women,1 
was a black woman, and 1 was an American
Indian woman.  Of the 214 new admissions, 
25 were Hispanic men.

Twenty States and the Federal Bureau of
Prisons reported a total of 58 persons
whose sentence of death was overturned
or removed.  Appeals courts vacated 27
sentences while upholding the convictions
and vacated 27 sentences while overturning 
the convictions.  Florida (9 exits) had 
the largest number of vacated capital 
sentences. Maryland, North Carolina, and 
Arizona each reported one commutation of 
a death sentence. 

As of December 31, 2000, 30 of 58 persons 
who were formerly under sentence of death 
were serving a reduced sentence, 13 were 
awaiting a new trial,5 were awaiting 
resentencing,2 had all capital charges 
dropped, and 5 had no action taken after 
being removed from under sentence of death.  
No information was available on the current 
status of 3 inmates.

In addition, 18 persons died while under
sentence of death in 2000.  All of these
deaths were from natural causes -- 2 each
in Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas, and
Nevada, and 1 each in Illinois, Missouri,
Ohio, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee,
and Arizona. 

From 1977, the year after the Supreme
Court upheld the constitutionality of
revised State capital punishment laws, 
to 2000, a total of 6,208 persons entered
prison under sentence of death. During
these 24 years, 683 persons were executed, 
and 2,312 were removed from under a 
death sentence by appellate court 
decisions and reviews, commutations, or 
death.***Footnote 1: An individual may
have been received and removed from under
sentence of death more than once. Data 
are based on the most recent sentence.***

Among individuals who received a death
sentence between 1977 and 2000, 3,058
(49%) were white, 2,542 (41%) were
black, 509 (8%) were Hispanic, and 99
(2%) were other races. The distribution
by race and Hispanic origin of the 2,995
inmates who were removed from death row 
between 1977 and 2000 was as follows:  
1,564 whites (52%), 1,202 blacks (40%), 
185 Hispanics (6%), and 44 persons of 
other races (1%). Of the 683 who were 
executed, 377 (55%) were white, 246 
(36%) were black, 49 (7%) were Hispanic, 
and 11 (2%) were of other races.
 
Criminal history of inmates under
sentence of death in 2000

Among inmates under a death sentence
on December 31, 2000,for whom criminal 
history information was available, 64% 
had prior felony convictions, including 
8% with at least one previous homicide 
conviction.

Among those for whom legal status at the
time of the capital offense was available,
39% had an active criminal justice status. 
Less than half of these were on parole,
and a quarter were on probation.  The
remaining quarter had charges pending,
were incarcerated, had escaped from
incarceration, or had some other criminal
justice status.

Criminal history patterns differed by race
and Hispanic origin.  More blacks (68%)
than whites (62%) or Hispanics (59%) had
a prior felony conviction. 

About the same percentage of whites,
blacks, and Hispanics had a prior
homicide conviction (8%). A slightly
higher percentage of Hispanics (24%) or
blacks (19%) than whites (15%) were on
parole when arrested for their capital
offense.

Since 1988,data have been collected on
the number of death sentences imposed
on entering inmates.  Among the 3,678
individuals received under sentence of
death during that time, about 1 in 7
entered with 2 or more death sentences.

Executions

According to data collected by the Federal
Government, from 1930 to 2000, 4,542
persons were executed under civil
authority.***Footnote 2: Military authority
carried out an additional 160 executions 
between 1930 and 1961.***
 
After the Supreme Court reinstated the
death penalty in 1976, 31 States executed
683 prisoners:

1977     1       1990       23

During this 24-year period, 5 States
executed 446 prisoners: Texas (239),
Virginia (81), Florida (50), Missouri 
(46), and Oklahoma (30).  These States
accounted for nearly two-thirds of 
all executions.  Between 1977 and 2000, 
372 white non-Hispanic men, 246 black
non-Hispanic men, 49 Hispanic men, 6
American Indian men, 5 Asian men, and 
5 white non-Hispanic women were
executed.

During 2000 Texas carried out 40
executions, Oklahoma executed 11
persons; Virginia, 8; Florida, 6; 
Missouri, 5; Alabama, 4; Arizona, 3; 
Arkansas, 2; and Delaware, Louisiana, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, 
Tennessee, and California, 1 each.  
The inmate executed in Tennessee was 
the first executed in that State 
since 1960.  Eighty-three persons 
executed in 2000 were male and two 
were female.  Forty-three were white; 
35 were black; 6 were Hispanic; and 
1 was American Indian.

From 1977 to 2000, 6,588 prisoners 
were under death sentences for varying 
lengths of time.  The 683 executions 
accounted for 10% of those at risk.  
A total of 2,312 prisoners (35% of 
those at risk) were removed by means 
other than execution.  About the same 
percentage of whites (12%), blacks 
(9%), and Hispanics (9%) were executed.
Somewhat larger percentages of whites
(37%) and blacks (35%) than Hispanics
(26%) were removed from under a death
sentence by means other than execution.

Among prisoners executed from 1977 to
2000, the average time spent between 
the imposition of the most recent 
sentence received and execution was 
more than 10 years.  White prisoners 
had spent an average of 9 years and 8 
months, and black prisoners, 10 years 
and 8 months. The 85 prisoners executed 
in 2000 were under sentence of death an 
average of 11 years and 5 months.

For the 683 prisoners executed between
1977 and 2000, the most common method
of execution was lethal injection (518). 
Other methods were electrocution (149),
lethal gas (11), hanging (3), and firing
squad (2).

The median time between the imposition
of a death sentence and yearend 2000
was 83 months.  Overall, the average time
for women was 6.1 years, 2 years less
than that for men (8.1 years).  On
average, whites, blacks, and Hispanics
had spent from 85 to 100 months under a
sentence of death.

Advance count of executions:  January
1, 2001 - November 30, 2001

To provide the latest data on capital
punishment, BJS gathers information
following each execution.  The data
include the date of execution, the
jurisdiction, method used, and the 
name, race, and gender of each person
executed.

Between January 1, 2001, and November
30, 2001, 15 States and the Federal
Government executed 62 inmates.  This
represents a 22% decrease from the 79
executed during the same period in 2000.

Oklahoma and Texas had carried out 16,
52% of the executions in 2001.  This is 
the most inmates executed in Oklahoma 
in a single year since the Federal 
Government began tracking executions on 
an annual basis.

The Federal Government executed two
inmates, the first since 1963 (and the
most since the two federally executed 
in 1957).  New Mexico executed one
inmate, the first since 1960.

Lethal injection accounted for all 62
executions.  This is the first year 
since executions resumed in 1977 that 
lethal injection was the only method 
used.

women were executed in Oklahoma.

Final counts for all of 2001 will appear in
Capital Punishment 2001, a BJS Bulletin,
released in late 2002. This annual report
will comprise data collected from State
and Federal departments of correction. The 
report will cover all persons under sentence 
of death on December 31, 2001, as well as 
those removed from under sentence of death.
--------------------------------------------

Methodology

Capital punishment information is
collected annually as part of the 
National Prisoner Statistics program 
(NPS-8). This data series is collected 
in two parts: data on persons under 
sentence of death are obtained from 
the department of correction in each 
jurisdiction currently authorizing capital 
punishment; information on the status of 
death penalty statutes is obtained from 
the Office of the Attorney General in 
each of the 50 States, the District of 
Columbia, and the Federal Government.  
Data collection forms and more detailed 
tables are available in Correctional 
Populations in the United States, 
published annually.  NPS-8 covers
all persons under sentence of death at
any time during the year who were held 
in a State or Federal nonmilitary correc-
tional facility.  Included are capital 
offenders transferred from prison to 
mental hospitals and those who may have 
escaped from custody.  Excluded are 
persons whose death sentences have been 
overturned by the court, regardless of 
their current incarceration status.

The statistics reported in this Bulletin 
may differ from data collected by other
organizations for a variety of reasons:  
(1) NPS-8 add inmates to the number under
sentence of death not at sentencing but at
the time they are admitted to State or
Federal correctional facility; (2) If in 
one year inmates entered prison under a 
death sentence or were reported as being 
relieved of a death sentence but the 
court had acted in the previous year,
the counts are adjusted to reflect the 
dates of court decisions (see the note 
on table 5 for the affected jurisdictions); 
(3) NPS counts are always for the last 
day of the calendar year and will differ 
from counts for more recent periods.

All data in this report have been reviewed
for accuracy by the data providers in each
jurisdiction prior to publication.
