EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

For youth to fulfill their potential in school, schools should be safe and
secure places for all students, teachers, and staff members. Without a safe
learning environment, teachers may have difficulty teaching and students
may have difficulty learning. Gauging the safety of the school
environment, however, may be difficult given the large amount of
attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence
nationwide.

Ensuring safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the current
state of school crime and safety across the nation and periodically
monitoring and updating these indicators. Indicators of School Crime and
Safety is designed to provide an annual snapshot of specific crime and
safety indicators, covering topics such as victimization, fights, bullying,
classroom disorder, teacher injury, weapons, and student perceptions of
school safety. In addition to covering a wide range of topics, the indicators
are based on information drawn from a wide range of sources, including
surveys of students, teachers, and principals, and data collections by
federal departments and agencies such as the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES), the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC).


KEY FINDINGS

The key findings of the report are presented below.


VIOLENT DEATHS AT SCHOOL

From July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2000, there were 32 school-associated
violent deaths in the United States (Indicator 1). Twenty-four of these
violent deaths were homicides and 8 were suicides. Sixteen of the 24
school-associated homicides involved school-aged children. These 16
homicides are a relatively small percentage (1 percent) of the total of 2,124
children ages 5-19 who were victims of homicide over the same period.
Six of the 8 school-associated suicides from July 1, 1999, through June 30,
2000, involved school-aged children. Away from school, there were a total
of 1,922 suicides of children ages 5-19 during the 2000 calendar year.


Nonfatal Student Victimization-Student Reports

The victimization rate for students ages 12-18 generally declined both at
school and away from school between 1992 and 2002; this was true for the
total crime rate as well as for thefts, serious violent crimes (including rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault), and violent crimes (that
is, serious violent crime plus simple assault) (Indicator 2). While this
overall trend indicates a decline during this time frame, no difference was
detected between 2001 and 2002 in the total crime rate, the rate of theft, or
the rate of violent victimization either at or away from school. 

•    In 2002, students ages 12-18 were more likely to be victims of
nonfatal serious violent crime away from school than at school (Indicator
2).1 Students in this age range were victims of about 309,000 serious
violent crimes away from school, compared with about 88,000 at school.

*  In 2002, younger students (ages 12-14) were more likely than older
students (ages 15-18) to be victims of crime at school, while older students
were more likely than younger students to be victims away from school
(Indicator 2).

*  In 2003, 5 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being victims of
nonfatal crimes, 4 percent reported being victims of theft, and 1 percent
reported being victims of violent incidents (Indicator 3).

*  The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who have been threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property fluctuated between 1993 and
2003, but without a clear trend (Indicator 4). In all survey years from 1993
to 2003, 7-9 percent of students reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school property in the preceding
12 months.
 
*  Between 1993 and 2003, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who
reported being in a fight anywhere declined from 42 percent to 33 percent
(Indicator 5). Similarly, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who
reported fighting on school property declined over this period, from 16
percent to 13 percent.

*  In 2003, 7 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that they had been
bullied at school. The percentage of students in this age range who had
been bullied increased from 5 percent in 1999 to 8 percent in 2001, but no
differences were detected between 2001 and 2003 (Indicator 6).

*  In 2003, public school students were more likely than private school
students to report being bullied (7 vs. 5 percent) (Indicator 6). In the same
year, rural students were more likely than their urban and suburban
counterparts to report being bullied (10 percent of rural students vs. 7
percent each of urban and suburban students).


Violence and Crime at School-Public School Reports

In 1999-2000, 20 percent of all public schools experienced one or more
serious violent crimes such as rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
aggravated assault. Seventy-one percent of public schools reported violent
incidents and 46 percent reported thefts (Indicator 7). This report also
provides the number of disciplinary actions taken by school principals for
reasons not related to academics. About 54 percent of public schools
reported taking a serious disciplinary action in the 1999-2000 school year.
Of those disciplinary actions, 83 percent were suspensions lasting 5 days
or more, 11 percent were removals with no services (i.e., expulsions), and
7 percent were transfers to specialized schools (Indicator 8). 

*  Secondary schools were more likely than other schools to experience a
violent incident during the 1999-2000 school year (92 vs. 61-87 percent
for elementary, middle, and combined schools) (Indicator 7).
 
*  Two percent of public schools took a serious disciplinary action for the
use of a firearm or explosive device, and 4 percent did so for the
possession of a firearm or explosive device (Indicator 8).

Nonfatal Teacher Victimization at School-Teacher Reports

Annually, over the 5-year period from 1998 to 2002, teachers were the
victims of approximately 234,000 total nonfatal crimes at school,
including 144,000 thefts and 90,000 violent crimes (rape, sexual assault,
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault) (Indicator 9). 

*  Over the 5-year period from 1998 to 2002, senior high school and
middle/junior high school teachers were more likely than elementary
school teachers to be victims of violent crimes (most of which were simple
assaults) (30 and 26 crimes, respectively, vs. 12 crimes per 1,000 teachers)
(Indicator 9). 

*  Teachers were differentially victimized by violent crimes at school
according to where they taught (Indicator 9). Over the 5-year period from
1998 to 2002, urban teachers were more likely than rural and suburban
teachers to be victims of violent crimes.

*  In the 1999-2000 school year, 9 percent of all elementary and secondary
school teachers were threatened with injury by a student, and 4 percent
were physically attacked by a student (Indicator 10). 

School Environment

The percentage of students who reported being afraid of being attacked at
school or on the way to and from school decreased from 12 percent in
1995 to 6 percent in 2001. No difference was detected between the most
recent survey years, 2001 and 2003, in the percentage of students who
feared such an attack (Indicator 12). In 1999 and 2001, students were more
likely to be afraid of being attacked at school or on the way to and from
school than away from school; however, in 2003, no difference was
detected in the percentage of students who reported fear of an attack at
school and those fearing an attack away from school. 

*  Between 1993 and 2003, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who
reported carrying a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school
property within the previous 30 days declined-from 12 percent to 6 percent
(Indicator 11). 

*  In 2003, 4 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that they had avoided
one or more places in school (Indicator 13). Between 1995 and 1999, the
percentage of students ages 12-18 who avoided one or more places in
school decreased from 9 to 5 percent, but no difference was detected in the
percentage of students who did so in 1999, 2001, and 2003 (between 4 and
5 percent in each year). 

*  In 2003, 12 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that someone at
school had used hate-related words against them (Indicator 14). That is, in
the previous 6 months, someone at school had called them a derogatory
word related to race, religion, ethnicity, disability, gender, or sexual
orientation. During the same period, about 36 percent of students ages
12-18 saw hate-related graffiti at school. 

*  In 2003, 21 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that street gangs
were present at their schools (Indicator 15). Students in urban schools
were the most likely to report the presence of street gangs at their school
(31 percent), followed by suburban students and rural students, who were
the least likely to do so (18 and 12 percent, respectively). 

*  In 1999-2000, public school principals were asked to report how often
certain disciplinary problems occurred at their schools. Twenty-nine
percent reported that student bullying occurred on a daily or weekly basis
and 19 percent reported that student acts of disrespect for teachers
occurred at the same frequency (Indicator 16). Additionally, 13 percent
reported student verbal abuse of teachers, 3 percent reported occurrences
of student racial tensions, and 3 percent reported widespread disorder in
the classrooms on a daily or weekly basis.
 
*  In 2003, 5 percent of students in grades 9-12 had at least one drink of
alcohol on school property in the 30 days prior to the survey, and 45
percent of students had at least one drink anywhere (Indicator 17).
 
*  In 2003, 22 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana
anywhere during the previous 30 days, and 6 percent reported using
marijuana on school property (Indicator 18). 

*  In 2003, 29 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported that someone
had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the
12 months prior to the survey (Indicator 19). 

(Footnote 1: These data are not adjusted by the number of hours that students spend
on school property and the number of hours they spend elsewhere.)


FOREWORD

The Indicators of School Crime and Safety provides the most recent
national indicators on school crime and safety. These indicators
demonstrate that improvements have occurred in the safety of students:
between 1992 and 2002, the violent crime victimization rate at school
declined from 48 violent victimizations per 1,000 students in 1992 to 24
such victimizations in 2002. Even so, violence, theft, bullying, drugs, and
firearms are still prevalent: students ages 12-18 were victims of about
659,000 violent crimes and 1.1 million crimes of theft at school in 2002. 

Accurate information about the nature, extent, and scope of the problem
being addressed is essential for developing effective programs and
policies. The information in this report is intended to serve as a foundation
for policymakers and practitioners so that they can develop effective
programs and policies to prevent violence and crime in schools and cope
with it when it occurs.

This is the seventh edition of Indicators of School Crime and Safety, a
joint publication of the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Center
for Education Statistics. This report provides detailed statistical
information to inform the nation on the current status of crime in schools.
The 2004 edition of Indicators includes the most recent available data,
including data from the 2003 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the 2002
National Crime Victimization Survey, and the 2003 School Crime
Supplement, a survey of our nation's students about their experiences with
school crime and safety. 

The data in this report were compiled from a number of statistical data
sources supported by the federal government. Such sources include results
from a study of violent deaths in schools, sponsored by the U.S.
Department of Education and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention; the National Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime
Supplement to the survey, sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
and the National Center for Education Statistics, respectively; the Youth
Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention; and the Schools and Staffing Survey and School Survey on
Crime and Safety, both sponsored by the National Center for Education
Statistics.

The entire report is available on the Internet. The Bureau of Justice
Statistics and the National Center for Education Statistics continue to work
toward providing more timely and complete data on the issues of
school-related violence and safety.

INTRODUCTION

Indicators of School Crime and Safety is designed to provide an annual
snapshot of specific crime and safety indicators, covering topics such as
victimization, fights, bullying, classroom disorder, teacher injury,
weapons, and student perceptions of school safety. In addition to covering
a wide range of topics, the indicators are based on information drawn from
a wide range of sources, including surveys of students, teachers, and
principals, and data collections by federal departments and agencies such
as the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Findings

Findings from this year's Indicators of School Crime and Safety show
students ages 12-18 were victims of about 1.8 million nonfatal crimes of
violence or theft at school in 2002, with the majority (62 percent) of all
victimizations at school being thefts. However, this report is not only
concerned with the safety of students at school. When available, data on
crimes that occur outside of school grounds are offered as a point of
comparison. (Footnote 1: Data in this report are not adjusted by the number of hours that youth
spend on school property and the number of hours they spend elsewhere.)
 In fact, as the data in this report show, a larger number of
serious violent victimizations (that is, rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
aggravated assault) take place away from school than at school. 

Preliminary data on homicides and suicides at school show there were 32
school-associated violent deaths in the United States between July 1, 1999,
and June 30, 2000, including 24 homicides, 16 of which involved
school-aged children. In each school year from 1992 to 2000, youth ages
5-19 were at least 70 times more likely to be murdered away from school
than at school.

Trends in school crime over time are also of interest to researchers,
educators, and families. No difference was detected in the percentages of
students ages 12-18 victimized at school between 2001 and 2003.
However, the percentage of students who reported being victims of crime
at school decreased from 10 percent to 5 percent between 1995 and 2003.
This included a decrease in theft (from 7 percent to 4 percent) and a
decrease in violent victimization (from 3 percent to 1 percent) over the
same time period.

Similarly, no differences were detected between 2001 and 2003 in the
percentages of students ages 12-18 who reported being afraid of being
attacked at school or on the way to and from school and the percentage of
students who avoided one or more places in school. These percentages had
declined from 1995 to 2001. The percentage of students in grades 9-12
who reported being in a fight during the previous 12 months on school
property and the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon
such as a gun, knife, or club on school property within the previous 30
days also declined.

For some other types of crime at school, the frequency of these behaviors
has shown no detectable pattern of increase or decrease over their
respective survey periods. These include the number of homicides and
suicides of school-aged youth at school between 1992 and 1999, the
percentage of students in grades 9-12 who have been threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property between 1993 and 2003, and the
percentage of teachers physically attacked by a student between 1993-94
and 1999-2000. No consistent patterns of increase or decrease were found
in the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who used alcohol on school
property between 1993 and 2003.

The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who reported using marijuana
on school property increased between 1993 and 1995 and then generally
declined between 1995 and 2003. Similarly, the percentage of students in
grades 9-12 who reported that drugs were made available to them on
school property increased from 1993 to 1995; however, no consistent
patterns of increase or decrease were found in the percentage of students
who had reported that drugs were made available to them between 1995
and 2003. The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported that they
had been bullied at school in the last 6 months increased between 1999
and 2001, although there was no measurable difference between 2001 and
2003.

Organization of This Report

This report, the seventh in a series of annual reports on school crime and
safety from BJS and NCES, presents the latest available data on school
crime and student safety. It is organized as a series of indicators, with each
indicator presenting data on a different aspect of school crime and safety.
The report provides updated data on nonfatal student victimization;
nonfatal victimization of teachers; students' perceptions of personal safety;
gangs; students' reports of being bullied, avoiding places, being called
hate-related words, and seeing hate-related graffiti; and students' reports of
being threatened or injured with a weapon, being in fights, carrying
weapons at school, using alcohol and marijuana, and drug availability on
school property. This year's report also includes data from last year's
Indicators of School Crime and Safety on principal reports of selected
crimes; principal reports of disciplinary problems and actions at school;
and fatal student victimization. 
 
This report is organized in five sections, starting with a description of the
most serious violence: Violent Deaths at School; Nonfatal Student
Victimization-Student Reports; Violence and Crime at School-Public
School Reports; Nonfatal Teacher Victimization at School-Teacher
Reports; and School Environment. Each section contains a set of
indicators that, taken together, describe a distinct aspect of school crime
and safety. 

Rather than relying on data from a large omnibus survey of school crime
and safety, this report uses a variety of independent data sources from
federal departments and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the FBI, and the
CDC. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection
method, and questionnaire design. By combining multiple and independent
sources of data, this report aims to present a more complete portrait of
school crime and safety than would be possible using any single source of
information. 

However, because the report relies on so many data sets, the age groups,
time periods, and types of respondents analyzed can vary from indicator to
indicator. Readers should keep these variations in mind when they
compare data from different indicators. Readers should also note that
trends in the data are discussed when possible. 

Where trends are not discussed, either the data are not available in earlier
surveys or survey question wording changed from year to year, eliminating
the ability to discuss any trend. Furthermore, while every effort has been
made to keep key definitions consistent across indicators, readers should
always use caution in making comparisons between results from different
data sets for several reasons: the data sets may contain definitional
differences, such as those used for specific crimes and crimes that occur
"at school," and respondent differences, such as examining students who
report a victimization (at the individual level) and a school reporting one
or more victimizations schoolwide. In addition, readers should always take
into account the standard error of an estimate in making comparisons.
Because most of the data in this report are from surveys that use a sample
of the population, the standard error will inform the reader of the precision
of differences between estimates. All the comparisons described in this
report are statistically significant at the .05 level.

Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the data sets used in
this report as well as a discussion of the calculation of standard errors for
each.



VIOLENT DEATHS
AT SCHOOL


INDICATOR 1

VIOLENT DEATHS AT SCHOOL AND AWAY FROM SCHOOL

In each school year from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 2000, youth ages 5-19
were at least 70 times more likely to be murdered away from school than
at school.

Violent deaths in schools are tragic events that affect not only the
individuals and families directly involved, but also many others in the
schools and communities where they occur. In the 2001-02 school year, 17
school-aged youth were victims of a school-associated violent death. In
this indicator, a school-associated violent death is a homicide, suicide,
legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), or unintentional
firearm-related death in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a
functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States. Deaths
that occurred while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions
at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an
official school-sponsored event, were also considered a school-associated
violent death. Victims of school-associated violent deaths include
students, staff members, and other nonstudents. Data were drawn from a
number of data sets to enable comparisons of homicides and suicides at
school and away from school. Data for school-associated violent deaths
during the 1999-2000 through 2000-01 school years are preliminary.

In the most recent school year for which data from all sources are
available, from July 1, 1999, to June 30, 2000, there were 32
school-associated violent deaths (table 1.1). Of these violent deaths, 24
were homicides and 8 were suicides. Sixteen of the homicides and 6 of the
suicides were of school-aged youth (ages 5-19) at school (figure 1.1 and
table 1.1). Combined, this translates into less than 1 homicide or suicide of
a school-aged youth at school per million students enrolled during the
1999-2000 school year. (Footnote 2: The total number of students in grades K-12 enrolled during the Fall of
the 1999 school year was 51,360,000 (U.S. Department of Education
forthcoming.))  Away from school, during roughly the same time
period, there were 2,124 homicides and 1,922 suicides of youth ages 5-19.

From July 1, 1992, to June 30, 2000, 390 school-associated violent deaths
occurred on campuses of U.S. elementary or secondary schools. Of these
violent deaths, 234 were homicides and 43 were suicides of school-aged
youth (ages 5-19). Away from school during roughly the same period, (Footnote 3"
The estimates include homicides of youth ages 5-19 occurring from July
1, 1992, to June 30, 2000, and suicides of youth ages 5-19 occurring from
1993 to 2000 calendar years.) 24,406 children ages 5-19 were victims of 
homicide and 16,735 children committed suicide. In each school year, 
youth were at least 70 times more likely to be murdered away from 
school than at school. 

Between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1999, no consistent pattern of increase
or decrease was observed in the number of homicides or suicides of
school-aged youth at school (figure 1.2 and table 1.1). During this period,
between 28 and 34 homicides and between 1 and 7 suicides of school-aged
youth occurred at school in each year. However, from July 1, 1998, to June
30, 2002, there has been a decline in the number of homicides at school,
from 33 homicides of youth at school during the 1998-99 school year, to
14 during the 2001-2002 school year.





This indicator repeats information from the 2003 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report.


NONFATAL STUDENT VICTIMIZATION-STUDENT REPORTS


INDICATOR 2

INCIDENCE OF VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL AND AWAY FROM
SCHOOL

Between 1992 and 2002, the victimization rate for students ages 12-18
generally declined for thefts, violent crimes, and serious violent crimes at
school and away from school.

Theft and violence at school and while going to and from school can lead
to a disruptive and threatening environment, physical injury, and
emotional stress, and can be an obstacle to student achievement (Elliott,
Hamburg, and Williams 1998). Data from the National Crime
Victimization Survey show that students ages 12-18 were victims of about
1.8 million nonfatal crimes (theft plus violent crime) while they were at
school and about 1.5 million crimes while they were away from school in
2002 (tables 2.1 and 2.3). (Footnote 4: "Students" refers to persons 
12-18 years old who reported being in any elementary or secondary grade 
at the time of the survey. An uncertain percentage of these persons may 
not have attended school during the survey reference period. These data 
do not take into account the number of hours that students spend at school 
and the number of hours they spend away from school.)  These figures 
represent victimization rates of 64 crimes per 1,000 students at school, 
and 55 crimes per 1,000 students away from school (tables 2.2 and 2.4). 

Students ages 12-18 were more likely to be victims of theft at school than
away from school in most years between 1992 and 2002 (tables 2.1 and
2.3). In 2002, about 1.1 million thefts occurred at school, and about
790,000 occurred away from school. In 2002, students ages 12-18 were
victims of about 659,000 violent crimes at school (rape, sexual assault,
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault), including 88,000 serious
violent crimes (rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault).
Away from school, students were victims of about 720,000 violent crimes,
including 309,000 serious violent crimes. From 1992 to 1997, the
victimization rates for violent crime were lower at school than away from
school; however, no such differences were detected between 1998 and
2002, except in 2000. In addition, the rates for serious violent crime were
lower at school than away from school in each survey year from 1992 to
2002.

The victimization rate for students ages 12-18 generally declined both at
school and away from school between 1992 and 2002; this was true for the
total crime rate as well as for thefts, violent crimes, and serious violent
crimes (figure 2.1 and tables 2.2 and 2.4). For example, the violent
victimization rate declined between 1992 and 2002 from 48 to 24 crimes
per 1,000 students at school and from 71 to 26 crimes per 1,000 students
away from school. While this overall trend indicates a decline during this
time frame, between 2001 and 2002, no differences were detected in the
total crime rate, the rate of theft, or the rate of violent victimization either
at or away from school.

In 2002, younger students (ages 12-14) were more likely than older
students (ages 15-18) to be victims of crime at school, while older students
were more likely than younger students to be victims away from school
(figures 2.2 and 2.3 and tables 2.2 and 2.4). No differences were detected
in the rates of theft, violent victimization, and serious violent victimization
between males and females both at school and away from school. The
rates of theft and serious violence at school were higher for urban and
suburban students than for rural students. However, no differences were
detected in the likelihood of theft and serious violent victimization away
from school between students living in urban, suburban, and rural areas.


This indicator has been updated to include 2002 data.


INDICATOR 3

PREVALENCE OF VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL

Overall, the percentage of students ages 12-18 reporting nonfatal
victimization declined between 1995 and 2003; however, no difference
was detected between the percentage of students victimized in the most
recent survey years, 2001 and 2003.

The most frequently occurring type of nonfatal crime in the United States
is theft, though violent crime continues to be of importance in examining
school safety (U.S. Department of Justice 2000). Data from the School
Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey show an
overall decrease in the percentage of students reporting nonfatal
victimization between 1995 and 2003; however, no difference was
detected between the percentage of students victimized in the most recent
survey years, 2001 and 2003 (figure 3.1 and table 3.1). This pattern held
true for total victimization rates, as well as the percentage of students who
reported theft, violent victimization, and serious violent victimization. In
1995, 10 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being victims of nonfatal
crimes at school: 7 percent reported theft and 3 percent reported a violent
incident; while in 2003, 5 percent of students reported being victims of
nonfatal crimes, 4 percent reported theft, and 1 percent reported a violent
incident. 

In 2003, victimization rates varied according to student characteristics.
Male students were more likely than female students to report being the
victim of a violent crime at school (2 vs. 1 percent) but no difference was
detected in their likelihood of reporting theft (4 percent for both). In 2003,
students in urban schools were more likely than their rural school
counterparts to report being victims of violent crime (2 vs. 1 percent).
Nonetheless, less than 3 percent of students reported being a victim of
violent crime in 2003-regardless of students' characteristic.

This indicator has been updated to include 2003 data.


INDICATOR 4

THREATS AND INJURIES WITH WEAPONS ON SCHOOL
PROPERTY

In 2003, male students in grades 9-12 were more likely than female
students to report being threatened or injured in the past year (12 vs. 6
percent).

Every year, some students are threatened or injured with a weapon while
they are on school property. The percentage of students victimized in this
way provides an important measure of how safe our schools are and how
this has changed over time. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students
in grades 9-12 were asked whether they had been threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property during the 12 months preceding the
survey. In 2003, 9 percent of students reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, on school property (table
4.1). The percentage of students who were threatened or injured in this
way has fluctuated between 1993 and 2003, but without a clear trend. In
all survey years from 1993 to 2003, 7-9 percent of students reported being
threatened or injured in this way.

The likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property varied by student characteristics. In each survey year, males were
more likely than females to report being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property (figure 4.1 and table 4.1). For example, in
2003, 12 percent of male students reported being threatened or injured in
the past year, compared with 6 percent of female students. Among
9th-12th-grade students, those in lower grades were more likely to be
threatened or injured with a weapon on school property than were those in
higher grades (figure 4.2 and table 4.1). In 2003, 12 percent of 9th-graders
reported that they were threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property, compared with 9 percent of 10th-graders, 7 percent of
11th-graders, and 6 percent of 12th-graders. 

Students' likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property was examined by race/ethnicity. In 2003, American Indian
students were more likely than Black, Hispanic, and White students to
report being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (22
percent vs. 11, 9, and 8 percent, respectively). In addition, Black students
were more likely than White students to report being threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property.

This indicator has been updated to include 2003 data.


INDICATOR 5

PHYSICAL FIGHTS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND ANYWHERE

The percentage of 9th-12th-grade students who reported being in a
physical fight on school property has declined-from 16 percent in 1993 to
13 percent in 2003.

Schools at which there are numerous physical fights may not be able to
maintain a focused learning environment for students. Further, students
who are involved in fights on school property may have difficulty
succeeding in their studies (Hamburg 1998). In the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked about their general
involvement in physical fights during the preceding 12 months (referred to
as "anywhere" in this analysis) and their involvement in physical fights on
school property. In 2003, 33 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported
being in a fight anywhere, and 13 percent said they had been in a fight on
school property (table 5.1). Between 1993 and 2003, the percentage of
students who reported being in a fight anywhere declined-from 42 percent
in 1993 to 33 percent in 2003. Similarly, the percentages of students who
reported fighting on school property in these years declined-from 16 to 13
percent. 

In all survey years, males were more likely than females to have been in a
fight anywhere and on school property (figure 5.1 and table 5.1). In 2003,
41 percent of males said they had been in a fight anywhere, and 17 percent
said they had been in a fight on school property. In that same year, 25
percent of females reported they had been in a fight anywhere, and 8
percent said they had been in a fight on school property. When looking at
different grade levels, students in lower grades reported being in fights
more frequently than students in higher grades, both anywhere and on
school property (figure 5.2 and table 5.1). For example, in 2003, 18
percent of 9th-graders, 13 percent of 10th-graders, 10 percent of
11th-graders, and 7 percent of 12th-graders reported being in a fight on
school property.

In 2003, the percentages of students engaging in fights anywhere varied
according to students' race/ethnicity. Specifically, Black and Hispanic
students were more likely than White students and American Indian
students were more likely than Asian and White students to report being in
a fight anywhere and on school property. In 2003, 24 percent of American
Indian students, 17 percent each of Black and Hispanic students, 13
percent of Asian students, and 10 percent of White students reported being
in a fight on school property.

This indicator has been updated to include 2003 data.


INDICATOR 6

BULLYING AT SCHOOL

In 2003, 7 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that they had been
bullied at school in the last 6 months; the percentage of students who
reported being bullied increased between 1999 and 2001 but no difference
was detected between 2001 and 2003.

Bullying can contribute to an environment of fear and intimidation in
schools (Arnette and Walsleben 1998; Ericson 2001). In the School Crime
Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages
12-18 were asked if they had been bullied (for example, picked on or made
to do things they did not want to do) at school. In recent years, fewer than
1 in 10 students reported that they had been bullied at school in the last 6
months. Although the percentage who had been bullied increased from 5
percent in 1999 to 8 percent in 2001, no difference was detected between
2001 and 2003 (figure 6.1 and table 6.1). In 2003, 7 percent of students
reported that they had been bullied at school. 

In 2003, White students were more likely than Hispanic students to report
being bullied (8 vs. 6 percent) (table 6.1). No other differences were
detected in the percentage of students who reported that they had been
bullied according to students' race/ethnicity and sex.

Grade level was inversely related to students' likelihood of being bullied:
as grade level increased, students' likelihood of being bullied decreased
(figure 6.2 and table 6.1). For example, in 2003, 14 percent of 6th-graders,
7 percent of 9th­graders, and 2 percent of 12th-graders reported that they
had been bullied at school. 

In 2003, public school students were more likely to report being bullied
than private school students (7 vs. 5 percent). In the same year, rural
students were more likely than their urban and suburban counterparts to
report being bullied (10 percent of rural students vs. 7 percent each of
urban and suburban students).

VIOLENCE AND CRIME AT SCHOOL-PUBLIC SCHOOL REPORTS 


INDICATOR 7

Violent and other incidents at public schools and those reported to the
police

In 1999-2000, 71 percent of public schools experienced one or more
violent incidents, while 36 percent reported one or more such incidents to
the police.

This indicator provides the percentage of schools that experienced one or
more crimes and the total number of crimes reported by schools. In the
School Survey on Crime and Safety, principals of public schools were
asked to provide the number of violent incidents, serious violent incidents,
thefts, and other incidents that occurred at their school, as well as the
number of incidents that were reported to the police. Violent incidents
include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or
without a weapon, threat of physical attack with or without a weapon, and
robbery with or without a weapon. 

In 1999-2000, an estimated 1.5 million violent incidents occurred in public
elementary and secondary schools (table 7.1). Seventy-one percent of
public schools experienced one or more violent incidents and 36 percent of
schools reported one or more such incidents to the police (tables 7.1 and
7.2). Twenty percent of schools experienced one or more serious violent
incidents (which are a subset of violent incidents and include rape, sexual
battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of
physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon) and
46 percent of public schools experienced one or more thefts. These
translate into an estimated 61,000 serious violent incidents and 218,000
thefts at public schools in 1999-2000. When looking at reports to police,
15 percent of public schools reported one or more serious violent incidents
to the police and 28 percent reported one or more thefts to the police.
 
The prevalence of violent incidents and those reported to the police varied
by the school level (figure 7.1 and tables 7.1 and 7.2). Schools with
students in higher grades were more likely to experience a violent incident
than those with students in lower grades. Specifically, secondary schools
were more likely to have a violent incident than elementary, middle, or
combined schools (92 percent vs. 61-87 percent for the other school
levels).

 A similar pattern was observed for those incidents that were reported to
the authorities: 71 percent of secondary schools reported a violent incident,
compared with 20 percent of elementary schools, 56 percent of middle
schools, and 51 percent of combined schools. 

When examining violent incidents by the location of public schools, city
schools were more likely than urban fringe schools to experience or report
to the police at least one violent incident during the 1999-2000 school year
(figure 7.3 and tables 7.1 and 7.2). Seventy-seven percent of city schools
had one or more violent incidents and 44 percent reported one or more
incidents to the police, compared with 67 and 35 percent, respectively, of
urban fringe schools. Rural schools were the least likely to report one or
more violent incidents to the police (29 percent vs. 35-44 percent for
public schools in urban fringe and city areas).

This indicator repeats information from the 2003 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report.


INDICATOR 8

SERIOUS DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TAKEN BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS

About 54 percent of public schools took a serious disciplinary action in the
1999-2000 school year. Of those disciplinary actions, 83 percent were
suspensions lasting 5 days or more, 11 percent were removals with no
services (i.e., expulsions), and 7 percent were transfers to specialized
schools.

The extent to which schools remove students from regular instruction as a
result of crime and violence has important consequences for student
instruction. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school
principals were asked to report the number of disciplinary actions taken
during the 1999-2000 school year for specific offenses that were not
academic infractions.

About 54 percent of public schools took at least one serious disciplinary
action, including suspensions lasting 5 days or more, removals with no
services (i.e., expulsions), and transfers to specialized schools, for any of
the offenses that occurred in the 1999-2000 school year (table 8.1).
Altogether, about 1,163,000 actions were taken. Of those serious
disciplinary actions, 83 percent were suspensions for 5 days or more, 11
percent were removals with no services, and 7 percent were transfers to
specialized schools (figure 8.1 and table 8.1).

Two percent of all public schools took one or more serious disciplinary
actions in response to the use of a firearm or explosive device, and 4
percent did so for the possession of such a device (figure 8.2 and table
8.1). Use of weapons other than firearms resulted in at least one serious
disciplinary action in 5 percent of schools, while possession of weapons
other than firearms led to a serious disciplinary action in 19 percent of
schools.

Ten percent of all public schools took one or more serious disciplinary
actions for the distribution of illegal drugs, and 20 percent for the
possession or use of illegal drugs or alcohol. In 1999-2000, public schools
took serious disciplinary actions for offenses such as fights (35 percent),
threats (22 percent), insubordination (18 percent), and other non-academic
infractions (14 percent).

This indicator repeats information from the 2003 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report.


Nonfatal Teacher Victimization at School-Teacher Reports 


INDICATOR 9

NONFATAL TEACHER VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL

Annually, over the 5-year period from 1998 to 2002, teachers were the
victims of approximately 234,000 total nonfatal crimes at school,
including 144,000 thefts and 90,000 violent crimes.

Students are not the only victims of crime at school. Teachers can also be
targets of violence and theft in schools. In addition to the personal toll that
violence may take on teachers, those who worry about their safety may
have difficulty teaching and may leave the profession altogether (Elliott,
Hamburg, and Williams 1998). 

Information on the number of crimes against teachers at school can help
show the extent of the problem. Estimates of teacher victimization are
drawn from the National Crime Victimization Survey, which obtains
information about the occupation of survey respondents. These events are
not limited to offenses committed by students; offenses committed by
others against teachers are also included.

Annually, over the 5-year period from 1998 to 2002, teachers were the
victims of approximately 234,000 total nonfatal crimes at school,
including 144,000 thefts and 90,000 violent crimes (rape, sexual assault,
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault) (table 9.1).(Footnote 5:
The average annual total number of crimes is the sum of all teacher
victimizations across the 5 years, divided by 5.) Among the
violent crimes against teachers during this 5-year period, there were about
11,000 serious violent crimes annually (accounting for 12 percent of the
violent crimes), including rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated
assault. On average, these figures translate into a rate of 32 thefts, 20
violent crimes, and 2 serious violent crimes per 1,000 teachers annually.
(Footnote 6: The average annual rate is the sum of all teacher victimizations across the
5 years divided by the sum of all teachers over those years, multiplied by
1,000.)

The average annual rate of violent victimization for teachers varied
according to their sex, instructional level, and urbanicity (figure 9.1 and
table 9.1). Over the 5-year period from 1998 to 2002, male teachers were
more likely than female teachers to be victims of violent crimes (34 vs. 15
crimes per 1,000 teachers annually). Senior high school and middle/junior
high school teachers were more likely than elementary school teachers to
be victims of violent crimes (30 and 26 crimes, respectively, vs. 12 crimes
per 1,000 teachers). In addition, annually over the 5-year period, urban
teachers were more likely than rural and suburban teachers to be victims of
violent crimes (28 vs. 12 crimes each  per 1,000 teachers).

This indicator has been updated to include 2002 data.


INDICATOR 10

TEACHERS THREATENED WITH INJURY OR ATTACKED BY
STUDENTS

In 1999-2000, teachers in central city schools were more likely than their
peers in urban fringe or rural schools to be threatened with injury or
physically attacked.

Some of the offenses against teachers are committed by students. Data on
the extent to which students make threats or physically attack elementary
and secondary teachers can provide a snapshot of this problem. In the
Schools and Staffing Survey, teachers were asked whether they had been
threatened with injury or physically attacked by a student in the previous
12 months. The survey results indicate that a smaller percentage of
elementary and secondary school teachers were threatened with injury by a
student at their school in the 1999-2000 school year than in the 1993-94
school year (9 vs. 12 percent) (table 10.1). No difference was detected in
the percentage of teachers physically attacked by a student in the
1999-2000 school year compared to the 1993-94 school year (4 percent in
both years) (table 10.2). 

In 1999-2000, few differences were detected in the likelihood of teachers
being victims of attacks or threats by students according to teachers'
race/ethnicity (tables 10.1 and 10.2). One such difference was that Black
teachers were more likely to be threatened than White teachers in
1999-2000 (12 vs. 9 percent).

In both survey years, teachers in central city schools were more likely to be
threatened with injury or physically attacked than teachers in urban fringe
or rural schools (figure 10.1 and tables 10.1 and 10.2). For example, in
1999-2000, 11 percent of teachers in central city schools had been
threatened with injury by students, compared with 8 percent each in urban
fringe and rural schools. Five percent of teachers in central city schools
had been attacked by students, while 3 percent each of teachers in urban
fringe and rural schools had experienced such attacks. 

In 1999-2000, teachers' reports of being victimized or attacked by a
student varied according to the level and sector of their school. Secondary
school teachers were more likely than elementary school teachers to have
been threatened with injury by a student (10 vs. 8 percent); however,
secondary school teachers were less likely to have been physically attacked
(2 vs. 6 percent). Public school teachers were more likely than private
school teachers to be victimized by students in school (figure 10.2 and
tables 10.1 and 10.2): 10 percent of public school teachers had been
threatened with injury, compared with 4 percent of private school teachers.
Likewise, 4 percent of public school teachers and 2 percent of private
school teachers had been physically attacked by students. Among teachers
in central city schools, those at public schools were four times more likely
to be targets of threats of injury than their colleagues in private schools (14
vs. 3 percent) and about three times more likely to be targets of attacks (6
vs. 2 percent).

This indicator repeats information from the 2003 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report.

SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT


INDICATOR 11

STUDENTS CARRYING WEAPONS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND
ANYWHERE

Between 1993 and 2003, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who
reported carrying a weapon anywhere or at school declined.

The presence of weapons at school can create an intimidating and
threatening atmosphere, making teaching and learning difficult (Ingersoll
and LeBoeuf 1997). The percentage of students who report that they carry
a gun or other weapon on school property is an indicator of the breadth of
the problem of weapons at school. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
students were asked if they had carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or
club in the past 30 days (referred to as "anywhere" in this analysis) or
carried one of these weapons onto school property in the past 30 days. In
2003, 17 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported they had carried a
weapon anywhere, and about 6 percent reported they had carried a weapon
on school property (table 11.1). 

Between 1993 and 2003, the percentage of students who reported carrying
a weapon anywhere generally declined from 22 to 17 percent. Similarly,
the percentage of students who carried a weapon at school also declined
during this period-from 12 to 6 percent. 

When looking at the types of students who carried weapons to school,
males were at least two times more likely than females to carry a
weapon-either anywhere or on school property in all survey years (figure
11.1 and table 11.1). For example, in 2003, 9 percent of males carried a
weapon on school property, compared with 3 percent of females, and 27
percent of males carried a weapon anywhere, compared with 7 percent of
females. In 2003, no relationship was detected by grade level for students
who reported carrying a weapon at school or anywhere (figure 11.2 and
table 11.1). 

In 2003, there were few differences in the percentages of students carrying
weapons anywhere and on school property according to students'
race/ethnicity. While American Indian students were more likely than
Black, White, and Hispanic students to carry a weapon on school property
and more likely than Black, White, Hispanic, and Asian students to carry a
weapon anywhere, no differences were detected among Black, White,
Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Islander students in the likelihood of carrying
a weapon anywhere or on school property.

This indicator has been updated to include 2003 data.


INDICATOR 12

STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF PERSONAL SAFETY AT SCHOOL
AND AWAY FROM SCHOOL

The percentage of students ages 12-18 who reported being afraid of being
attacked at school or on the way to and from school decreased-from 12
percent in 1995 to 6 percent in 2003; however, no difference was detected
in the percentage of students who feared such an attack between the most
recent survey years, 2001 and 2003.

School violence can make students fearful and affect their readiness and
ability to learn. Concerns about vulnerability to attacks also have a
detrimental effect on the school environment (Elliott, Hamburg, and
Williams 1998). In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime
Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked how often they had
been afraid of attack "at school or on the way to and from school" and
"away from school" during the previous 6 months. (Footnote 7:
In 1995 and 1999, students reported fear of "attack or harm" at school or
on the way to and from school during the previous 6 months. In 2001 and
2003, students reported fear of "attack or threat of attack" at school or on
the way to and from school during the previous 6 months. Includes
students who reported that they sometimes or most of the time feared
being victimized in this way.)


In 1999 and 2001, students were more likely to report they were afraid of
being attacked at school or on the way to and from school than away from
school; however, in 2003, no such difference was detected (figure 12.1 and
table 12.1). The percentages of students who reported being afraid of being
attacked at school or on the way to and from school decreased from 12
percent in 1995 to 6 percent in 2003; however, no difference was detected
in the percentage of students who feared such an attack between the most
recent survey years, 2001 and 2003.

In 2003, female students were more likely than male students to fear for
their safety both at school and away from school. In the same year, Black
and Hispanic students were more likely than White students to fear for
their safety regardless of location (figure 12.2 and table 12.1). That is, 11
percent of Black students and 10 percent of Hispanic students reported that
they were afraid of being attacked at school or on the way to and from
school, compared with 4 percent of White students. Away from school, 10
percent of Black students, 7 percent of Hispanic students, and 4 percent of
White students reported that they were afraid of an attack.

In 2003, grade level was inversely related to students' likelihood of fearing
an attack at school or on the way to and from school: as grade level
increased, students' likelihood of fearing an attack decreased. In the same
year, 10 percent of 6th-graders, 6 percent of 9th-graders, and 4 percent of
12th-graders feared for their safety at school or on the way to and from
school. 

In addition, school location was also related to students' fear of attack: In
2003, students in urban schools were more likely than students in suburban
and rural schools to fear being attacked both at school or on the way to and
from school and away from school. Ten percent of students in urban
schools feared being attacked at school, compared with 5 percent each of
their peers in suburban and rural schools. In the same year, public school
students were more likely than private school students to fear an attack at
school (6 vs. 3 percent), but away from school no such difference was
detected (5 percent each).

This indicator has been updated to include 2003 data.


INDICATOR 13

STUDENTS' REPORTS OF AVOIDING PLACES IN SCHOOL 

In 2003, students' avoidance of certain places in school differed according
to the location and sector of their school: students ages 12-18 in urban
schools and public schools were more likely than their counterparts in
rural or suburban schools and private schools to report that they had
avoided one or more places in school.

School crime may lead students to perceive specific areas at school as
unsafe. In trying to ensure their own safety, they begin to avoid these
places (Ingersoll and LeBoeuf 1997). Changes in the percentage of
students who avoid certain areas in school may be a good barometer of
students' perceptions of school safety. In the School Crime Supplement to
the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked
whether they had avoided certain places in school-such as the entrance,
any hallways or stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places
inside the school building-during the previous 6 months. This indicator
provides estimates of those students who responded they avoided at least
one of these places.

In 2003, 4 percent of students reported that they had avoided one or more
places in school (table 13.1). Between 1995 and 1999, the percentage of
students ages 12-18 who avoided one or more places in school decreased
from 9 to 5 percent, but no difference was detected in the percentage of
students who did so in 1999, 2001, and 2003 (between 4 and 5 percent in
each year). 

Students' reports of avoiding places varied according to their
race/ethnicity. In 2003, 3 percent of White students reported avoiding
certain areas, compared with 5 percent of Black students and 6 percent of
Hispanic students (figure 13.1 and table 13.1). As in all previous survey
years, in 2003, no difference was detected in the extent to which students
avoided places according to their sex.

In the most recent survey year, students' avoidance of certain places in
school differed according to their grade level and the location and sector of
their school. Generally, grade level was inversely associated with students'
likelihood of avoiding places in school. In 2003, 6 percent of 6th­graders
compared with 1 percent of 12th-graders avoided certain places in school.
In the same year, students in urban areas were the most likely to avoid
specific places in school: 6 percent of urban students reported that they
had done so, compared with 4 percent of suburban and 3 percent of rural
students. In addition, public school students were more likely to avoid
certain places in school than private school students (4 vs. 2 percent).

This indicator has been updated to include 2003 data.


INDICATOR 14

STUDENTS' REPORTS OF BEING CALLED HATE-RELATED
WORDS AND SEEING HATE-RELATED GRAFFITI

In 2003, 12 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that someone at school
had used hate-related words against them, and more than one-third (36
percent) of students ages 12-18 had seen hate-related graffiti at school.

A student's exposure to hate-related words or symbols at school may
increase that student's feeling of vulnerability. Discriminatory behavior in
schools can create a hostile environment that is not conducive to learning
(McLaughlin and Brilliant 1997). In the School Crime Supplement to the
National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked if
someone at school had called them a derogatory word having to do with
their race, religion, ethnicity, disability, gender, or sexual orientation
during the previous 6 months. In the 2001 and 2003 administrations of the
survey, they were then asked to specify the characteristic to which the
hate-related word was directed. 

In 2003, 12 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that someone at school
had used hate-related words against them (figure 14.1 and table 14.1).
Four percent of respondents reported that the hate-related words concerned
their race, about 2 percent each reported that the words concerned their
ethnicity or gender, and 1 percent each reported that the words were
related to their religion, disability, or sexual orientation (table 14.2). In
1999, 2001, and 2003, students were also asked if they had seen
hate-related graffiti at their school-that is, hate-related words or symbols
written in classrooms, bathrooms, hallways, or on the outside of the school
building (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). In each survey year, 36 percent of
students saw hate-related graffiti at school. 

Students' experiences of being called specific types of hate-related words
in 2003 differed according to their sex and race/ethnicity (table 14.2). For
example, females were more likely to report gender-related hate words
than males (4 vs. 1 percent) and White students were less likely to report
race-related hate words than students of other race/ethnicities (2 percent of
White students vs. 7 percent of Black students, 5 percent of Hispanic
students, and 9 percent of students in other racial/ethnic groups). 

In 2003, differences were found according to school location and sector in
students' reports of being called hate-related words or seeing hate-related
graffiti (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). Urban students were more likely than
rural and suburban students to see graffiti and more likely than suburban
students to be called a hate-related word, but no other differences were
detected according to urbanicity. Public school students were more likely
than their private school counterparts to report seeing graffiti, but no such
difference was found in the likelihood of being called a hate-related word.

This indicator has been updated to include 2003 data.


INDICATOR 15

STUDENTS' REPORTS OF GANGS AT SCHOOL

In 2003, students ages 12-18 in urban schools were the most likely to
report the presence of street gangs at their school, followed by their
counterparts in suburban and rural schools.

Street gangs are organized groups that are often involved in drugs,
weapons trafficking, and violence. The presence of street gangs at school
can be very disruptive to the school environment because they may not
only create fear among students but also increase the level of violence in
school (Laub and Lauritsen 1998). In the School Crime Supplement to the
National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked if
street gangs were present at their schools during the previous 6 months.

In 2003, 21 percent of students reported that there were gangs at their
schools (table 15.1). Of all the students surveyed, students in urban
schools were the most likely to report the presence of street gangs at their
school (31 percent), followed by suburban students and rural students, who
were the least likely to do so (18 and 12 percent, respectively). However,
no difference was detected between 2001 and 2003 in percentages of
students who reported the presence of street gangs, regardless of school
location.

Hispanic and Black students were more likely than White students to
report the existence of street gangs in their schools in 2003 (37 and 29
percent, respectively, vs. 14 percent) (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). This
pattern also held among students in urban schools and suburban schools.
For rural students, the only significant difference was between Black
students (22 percent) and White students (11 percent).

Students in public schools were more likely to report the presence of street
gangs than students in private schools regardless of the school's location
(figure 15.2 and table 15.1). In 2003, 23 percent of students in public
schools reported that there were street gangs in their schools, compared
with 4 percent of students in private schools. Among public school
students, students in urban schools were the most likely to report the
presence of street gangs at their school, followed by suburban students and
rural students. For private school students, no significant difference was
detected according to urbanicity.

INDICATOR 16

DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS REPORTED BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS

In 1999-2000, more than one-quarter (29 percent) of public schools
reported daily or weekly student bullying.

Discipline problems in a school may contribute to an overall environment
in which violence and crime may occur. In the School Survey on Crime
and Safety, school principals were asked how often certain disciplinary
problems occur. Behaviors discussed in this indicator include racial
tensions, bullying, student verbal abuse of teachers, widespread classroom
disorder, and student acts of disrespect for teachers that happened daily or
once a week. If gang or cult activities happened at all in the school, they
were included as problematic.

In 1999-2000, more than one-quarter (29 percent) of public schools
reported daily or weekly student bullying (table 16.1). Among the other
discipline problems reported, 19 percent of public schools reported student
acts of disrespect for teachers, 13 percent reported student verbal abuse of
teachers, 3 percent reported student racial tensions, and 3 percent reported
widespread disorder in classrooms. Furthermore, 19 percent of public
schools reported undesirable gang activities and 7 percent of schools
reported undesirable cult or extremist activities occurred at some point in
time during the 1999-2000 school year.

Discipline problems reported by public schools varied by school
characteristics. For example, middle schools were more likely than
elementary and secondary schools to report racial tensions, bullying,
verbal abuse of teachers, and widespread disorder in classrooms (figure
16.1 and table 16.1). Middle schools were more likely than elementary
schools, but less likely than high schools to report gang or extremist cult
activity.

The prevalence of discipline problems was related to school size. As
school enrollment increased, so did the likelihood of schools reporting
each discipline problem at their school except widespread disorder in the
classroom-which was reported by relatively few principals (less than 5
percent at all enrollment levels). Twenty-six percent of principals at
schools with 1,000 or more students reported student verbal abuse of
teachers, compared to 14 percent of schools with 500-999 students, 10
percent of schools with 300-499 students, and 7 percent of schools with
less than 300 students. 

Schools that had one or more violent incidents occur at their school were
more likely to report each of the disciplinary problems discussed above
than those schools with no violent incidents. For example, 34 percent of
schools with one or more violent incidents reported that bullying happened
at least once a week, compared with 17 percent of schools with no violent
incidents.

This indicator repeats information from the 2003 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report.


INDICATOR 17

STUDENTS' USE OF ALCOHOL ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND
ANYWHERE

In 2003, 45 percent of students in grades 9-12 had at least one drink of
alcohol anywhere in the 30 days before being surveyed and 5 percent had
at least one drink on school property.

The consumption of alcohol by students on school property, a crime in
itself, may lead to other crimes and misbehavior on the part of students. It
may also lead to a school environment that is harmful to students, teachers,
and staff (Fagan and Wilkinson 1998). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey,
students in grades 9-12 were asked whether they had consumed alcohol at
all in the past 30 days (referred to as "anywhere" in this analysis) and if
they had consumed alcohol on school property. In 2003, 45 percent of
students had consumed at least one drink of alcohol anywhere in the 30
days before being surveyed, and a smaller percentage (5 percent) had
consumed at least one drink on school property (table 17.1). When
examining students' reports of drinking between 1993 and 2003, no
consistent patterns of increase or decrease were found in the percentage of
students who had consumed alcohol on school property (between 5 and 6
percent in all survey years). The percentage of students who reported using
alcohol anywhere increased from 48 percent in 1993 to 52 percent in 1995
and then declined between 1995 and 2003.

The likelihood of drinking alcohol varied by student characteristics. In
2003, males were more likely than females to use alcohol on school
property (6 vs. 4 percent), a difference not found in the percentages who
reported drinking anywhere (figure 17.1 and table 17.1). In 2003, students
in higher grades were more likely to report drinking alcohol anywhere than
students in lower grades (figure 17.2 and table 17.1). However, no
relationship was found across grade levels for students' reports of drinking
alcohol on school property.

In 2003, Asian and Black students were less likely to use alcohol anywhere
than American Indian, White, or Hispanic students. Twenty-eight percent
of Asian students and 37 percent of Black students reported using alcohol
anywhere, compared with between 46 and 52 percent of students in the
other racial/ethnic groups. On school property, Black and Hispanic
students were more likely to use alcohol than White students (6 and 8
percent, respectively, vs. 4 percent).

This indicator has been updated to include 2003 data.

INDICATOR 18

STUDENTS' USE OF MARIJUANA ON SCHOOL PROPERTY AND
ANYWHERE

In 2003, 22 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana
anywhere during the last 30 days, and 6 percent of students reported using
marijuana on school property.

The use of drugs, such as marijuana, at school may lead to a school
environment that is harmful to students, teachers, and school
administrators. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades
9-12 were asked whether they had used marijuana at all in the past 30 days
(referred to as "anywhere" in this analysis) and whether they had used
marijuana on school property. In 2003, 22 percent of students in grades
9-12 reported using marijuana anywhere during the last 30 days, whereas 6
percent of students reported using marijuana on school property (table
18.1). The percentage of students who reported using marijuana on school
property increased from 6 percent in 1993 to 9 percent in 1995, and then
declined between 1995 and 2003 (from 9 to 6 percent). The percentage of
students who reported using marijuana anywhere also increased between
1993 and 1995 (from 18 to 25 percent). In 1995, 1997, and 1999, roughly
one-quarter of students reported using marijuana anywhere (between 25
and 27 percent); however, by 2003, the percentage of students who
reported using marijuana anywhere had declined to 22 percent.

Both students' sex and grade level were associated with use of marijuana.
Males were more likely than females to have used marijuana in every
survey year, anywhere or on school property (figure 18.1 and table 18.1).
For example, in 2003, 8 percent of males and 4 percent of females
reported using marijuana on school property. In that same year, students in
lower grades were less likely than students in higher grades to report using
marijuana anywhere (figure 18.2 and table 18.1). However, no
corresponding difference was detected in students' use of marijuana on
school property according to grade in school-between 5 and 7 percent of
students in grades 9-12 reported such use in 2003. 

In 2003, Asian students were less likely than students of all other
race/ethnicities to report using marijuana anywhere (10 percent vs.
between 22 and 33 percent of students in other racial/ethnic groups). At
school, Hispanic students were more likely to report using marijuana than
Asian or White students (7 percent vs. 4 and 5 percent, respectively).
However, few other differences were found among racial/ethnic groups for
students' marijuana use at school.

This indicator has been updated to include 2003 data.


INDICATOR 19

STUDENTS' REPORTS OF DRUG AVAILABILITY ON SCHOOL
PROPERTY

In 2003, 29 percent of all students in grades 9-12 reported that someone
had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the
12 months before the survey.

The availability of drugs on school property has a disruptive and
corrupting influence on the school environment (Nolin et al. 1997). In the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether
someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school
property in the 12 months before the survey. In 2003, 29 percent of all
students in grades 9-12 reported that drugs were made available to them on
school property (table 19.1). The percentage of students who reported that
drugs were made available to them on school property increased from 24
percent in 1993 to 32 percent in 1995. However, no consistent patterns of
increase or decrease were found in the percentage of students who had
reported that drugs were made available to them from 1995 to 2003, with
between 29 and 32 percent of students reporting that this occurred in each
survey year.

Males were more likely than females to report that drugs were offered,
sold, or given to them on school property in each survey year (figure 19.1
and table 19.1). For example, in 2003, 32 percent of males reported the
availability of drugs, while 25 percent of females did so. No differences
were detected in the percentage of students who reported that drugs were
made available to them according to grade (figure 19.2 and table 19.1). 
Students' racial/ethnic backgrounds were examined in relation to whether
they reported having illegal drugs offered, sold, or given to them on school
property. In 2003, Hispanic students were more likely than Asian, Black,
and White students to report that drugs were made available to them (37
percent vs. between 23 and 28 percent). 

This indicator has been updated to include 2003 data.

TECHNICAL NOTES

General Information

The information presented in this report was obtained from many data
sources, including databases from the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI). While some of the data were collected from universe
surveys, most were gathered by sample surveys. Some questions from
different surveys may appear the same, but they were actually asked of
different populations of students (e.g., students ages 12–18 or students in
grades 9–12); in different years; about experiences that occurred within
different periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during the past 12
months); and at different locations (e.g., in school or at home). Readers of
this report should take particular care when comparing data from the
different data sources. The results from the different sources may not be
strictly comparable because of the variation in collection procedures,
timing, phrasing of questions, sampling techniques, and so forth. After
introducing the data sources used for this report, the next section discusses
the accuracy of estimates and describes the statistical procedures used. 

Sources of Data

Figure A.1 presents some key information for each of the data sets used in
the report, including the survey year(s), target population, response rate,
and sample size. The remainder of the section briefly describes each data
set and provides directions for obtaining more information. The exact
wording of the interview questions used to construct the indicators are
presented in figure A.2. (Figures appear at the end of appendix A.)


National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) 

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), administered for the
U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, is the
nation’s primary source of information on crime victimization and the
victims of crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned in 1992, the NCVS
collects detailed information annually on the frequency and nature of the
crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault,
theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft experienced by
Americans and their households each year. The survey measures crimes
reported as well as those not reported to police. 

Readers should note that in order to improve understandability, the
presentation of the total number of crimes against teachers shown in
Indicator 9 has been revised to reflect the average annual number of crimes
against teachers over the 5-year time period. Because of this change,
readers are cautioned not to compare results presented in this year’s
Indicators of School Crime and Safety report with those presented in
previous reports.

The NCVS sample consists of about 53,183 households selected using a
stratified, multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary sampling
units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected.
In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs),
were selected from each sampled PSU.

 Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments,
were selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done
proportionate to population size in order to create a self-weighting sample.
The final sample was augmented to account for housing units constructed
after the decennial Census. Within each sampled household, U.S. Bureau
of the Census personnel interviewed all household members ages 12 and
older to determine whether they had been victimized by the measured
crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview. 

The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in person.
Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone, if possible. About
75,235 persons ages 12 and older are interviewed each 6 months.
Households remain in the sample for 3 years and are interviewed seven
times at 6-month intervals. The initial interview at each sample unit is
used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid
duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews. After their
seventh interview, households are replaced by new sample households.
The NCVS has consistently obtained a response rate of about 92 percent at
the household level. During the study period, the completion rates for
persons within households were about 87 percent. Thus, final response
rates were about 84 percent. Weights were developed to permit estimates
for the total U.S. population 12 years and older. For more information

School Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD) 

The School Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD) is an
epidemiological study developed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education and the
U.S. Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to describe the epidemiology of
school-associated violent deaths, identify common features of these
deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated violent death in the United
States, and identify potential risk factors for these deaths. The surveillance
system includes descriptive data on all school-associated violent deaths in
the United States, including all homicides, suicides, and unintentional
firearm-related deaths where the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a
functioning elementary or secondary school, while the victim was on the
way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or while attending or on
the way to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims of such
events include nonstudents as well as students and staff members. SAVD
includes descriptive information about the school, event, victim(s), and
offender(s). The SAVD Surveillance System has collected data from July
1, 1992, through June 30, 2002. 

SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on
school-associated violent deaths. Cases are initially identified through a
search of the Lexis/Nexis and Dialog newspaper and media databases.
Then police officials are contacted to confirm the details of the case to
determine if the event meets the case definition.

Once a case is confirmed, a police official and a school official are
interviewed regarding details about the school, event, victim(s), and
offender(s). If police officials are unwilling or unable to complete the
interview, a copy of the full police report is obtained. The information
obtained on schools includes school demographics, attendance/absentee
rates, suspension/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon
carrying, security measures, violence prevention activities, school response
to the event, and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information
includes the location of injury, the context of injury (while classes held,
during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of injury, and school and
community events happening around the time period. Information obtained
on victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics, circumstances of the
event (date/time, alcohol or drug use, number of persons involved), types
and origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors,
school-related problems, extracurricular activities, and family history,
including structure and stressors.

One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths were identified
from July 1, 1992–June 30, 1994 (see Kachur et al. 1996). The most recent
report from this data collection identified 253 school-associated violent
deaths between July 1, 1994–June 30, 1999 (see Anderson et al. 2001).
The first effort achieved a response rate of 85 percent for police officials
and 81 percent for school officials. The most recent SAVD has achieved a
response rate of 97 percent for police officials and 78 percent for school
officials. Data for subsequent study years are still preliminary and subject
to change. For additional information about SAVD, contact:

School Crime Supplement (SCS) 

Created as a supplement to the NCVS and codesigned by the National
Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the School
Crime Supplement (SCS) survey was conducted in 1989, 1995, 1999,
2001, and 2003 to collect additional information about school-related
victimizations on a national level. This report includes data from the 1995,
1999, 2001, and 2003 collections. The 1989 data are not included in this
report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS. The
survey was designed to assist policymakers as well as academic
researchers and practitioners at the federal, state, and local levels so that
they can make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The SCS
asks students a number of key questions about their experiences with and
perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on
school grounds, on a school bus, or on the way to or from school.
Additional questions not included in the NCVS were also added to the
SCS, such as those concerning preventive measures used by the school,
students’ participation in after-school activities, students’ perceptions of
school rules, the presence of weapons and street gangs in school, the
presence of hate-related words and graffiti in school, student reports of
bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the availability of drugs
and alcohol in school, as well as attitudinal questions relating to fear of
victimization and avoidance behavior at school. 

In all SCS survey years, the SCS was conducted for a 6-month period from
January–June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion
above for information about the NCVS sampling design). It should be
noted that the initial NCVS interview is included in the SCS data
collection. Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS
were those household members who had attended school at any time
during the 6 months preceding the interview, and were enrolled in grades
6–12 in a school that would help them advance toward eventually
receiving a high school diploma. The age range of students covered in this
report is 12–18 years of age. Eligible respondents were asked the
supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing their entire
NCVS interview. 

In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified from previous
collections in three ways. First, in 1995 and 1999, “at school" was defined
for respondents as in the school building, on the school grounds, or on a
school bus. In 2001, the definition for “at school" was changed to mean in
the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and
from school. This change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order to
be consistent with the definition of “at school" as it is constructed in the
National Crime Victimization Survey and was also used as the definition
in 2003. Cognitive interviews conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census
on the 1999 School Crime Supplement suggested that modifications to the
definition of “at school" would not have a substantial impact on the
estimates.

The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2003 was
calculated by using NCVS incident variables appended to the 1995, 1999,
2001, and 2003 SCS data files. The NCVS type of crime variable was used
to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent,
or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident happened and
what the victim was doing when it happened were used to ascertain
whether the incident happened at school. For prevalence of victimization,
the NCVS definition of “at school" includes in the school building, on
school property, or on the way to or from school.

Second, the SCS questions pertaining to fear and avoidance changed
between the 1999 and 2001 SCS. In 1995 and 1999, students were asked if
they avoided places or were fearful because they thought someone would
“attack or harm" them. In 2001 and 2003, students were asked if they
avoided places or were fearful because they thought someone would
“attack or threaten to attack them." These changes should be considered
when making comparisons between the 1995 and 1999 data and the 2001
and 2003 data. 

Third, the SCS question pertaining to gangs changed in the 2001 SCS. The
introduction and definition of gangs as well as the placement of the item in
the questionnaire changed in the 2001 SCS. Because of these changes, the
reader should be cautioned not to compare results based on the 2001 and
2003 SCS presented in this report with those estimates of gangs presented
in previous reports.

Total victimization is a combination of violent victimization and theft. If
the student reported an incident of either violent or theft victimization or
both, he or she is counted as having experienced “total" victimization.
 Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and
simple assault. 

A total of 9,728 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 8,398 in 1999,
8,374 in 2001, and 7,152 in 2003. In the 2003 SCS, the household
completion rate was 92 percent. In the 1995, 1999, and 2001 SCS, the
household completion rates were 95 percent, 94 percent, and 93 percent,
respectively; and the student completion rates were 78 percent, 78 percent,
and 77 percent, respectively. For the 2003 SCS, the student completion
rate was 70 percent.

Thus, the overall unweighted SCS response rate (calculated by multiplying
the household completion rate by the student completion rate) was 74
percent in 1995, 73 percent in 1999, 72 percent in 2001, and 64 percent in
2003. 

Response rates for most survey items were high—typically over 95 percent
of all eligible respondents. The weights were developed to compensate for
differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The weighted data
permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled
in schools in 1995, 1999, 2001, and 2003. For SCS data, a full
nonresponse bias analysis has not been conducted. For more information

School Survey on Crime and Safety

The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) was conducted by
NCES in Spring/Summer of the 1999–2000 school year. SSOCS focuses
on incidents of specific crimes/offenses and a variety of specific discipline
issues in public schools. It also covers characteristics of school policies,
school violence prevention programs and policies, and school
characteristics that have been associated with school crime. The survey
was conducted with a nationally representative sample of regular public
elementary, middle, and high schools in the 50 states and the District of
Columbia. Special education, alternative and vocational schools, schools
in the territories, and schools that taught only prekindergarten,
kindergarten, or adult education were not included in the sample. 

The sampling frame for the SSOCS:2000 was constructed from the public
school universe file created for the 2000 Schools and Staffing Survey from
the 1997–98 NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) Public School Universe
File. The sample was stratified by instructional level, type of locale, and
enrollment size. Within the primary strata, schools were also sorted by
geographic region and by percentage of minority enrollment. The sample
sizes were then allocated to the primary strata in rough proportion to the
aggregate square root of the size of enrollment of schools in the stratum. A
total of 3,300 schools were selected for the study. Among those, 2,270
schools completed the survey. In March 2000, questionnaires were mailed
to school principals, who were asked to complete the survey or to have it
completed by the person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at the
school. The weighted overall response rate was 70 percent, and item
nonresponse rates ranged from 0–2.7 percent on the public-use data file.
For SSOCS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis was conducted and no
bias on the basis of nonresponse was detected. The weights were
developed to adjust for the variable probabilities of selection and
differential nonresponse and can be used to produce national estimates for
regular public schools in the 1999–2000 school year. For more information

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)

This report draws upon data on teacher victimization from the Schools and
Staffing Survey (SASS), which provides national- and state-level data on
public and national- and affiliation-level on private schools. The 1993–94
and 1999–2000 SASS were collected by the U.S. Bureau of the Census
and sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics. SASS
consists of four sets of linked surveys, including surveys of schools, the
principals of each selected school, a subsample of teachers within each
school, and public school districts.
 
The sampling frames for the 1993–94 and 1999–2000 SASS were created
using the 1991–92 and 1997–98 NCES Common Core of Data (CCD)
Public School Universe File, respectively. Data were collected by
multistage sampling, which began with the selection of schools. This
report uses 1993–94 and 1999–2000 SASS data. Approximately 9,900
public schools and 3,300 private schools were selected to participate in the
1993–94 SASS and 9,900 public schools and 3,600 private schools were
selected to participate in the 1999–2000 SASS. Within each school,
teachers selected were further stratified into one of five teacher types in the
following hierarchy: (1) Asian or Pacific Islander; (2) American Indian,
Aleut, or Eskimo; (3) teachers who teach classes designed for students
with limited English proficiency; (4) teachers in their first, second, or third
year of teaching; and (5) teachers not classified in any of the other groups.
Within each teacher stratum, teachers were selected systematically with
equal probability. In 1993–94, approximately 53,000 public school
teachers and 10,400 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999–2000,
56,400 public school teachers and 10,800 private school teachers were
sampled. 

This report focuses on responses from teachers. The overall weighted
response rates were 83 percent and 77 percent for public school teachers in
1993–94 and 1999–2000, respectively. For private school teachers, the
overall weighted response rates were 73 percent and 67 percent in
1993–94 and 1999–2000, respectively. Values were imputed for
questionnaire items that should have been answered but were not. For

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) 

The Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), which are a part of the
Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, provide incident-level
information on criminal homicides including situation (number of victims
to number of offenders); the age, sex, and race of victims and offenders;
types of weapons used; circumstances of the incident; and the relationship
of the victim to the offender. The data are provided monthly to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) by local law enforcement agencies
participating in the FBI’s UCR program. The data include murders and
non-negligent manslaughters in the United States from January
1976–December 2001; that is, negligent manslaughters and justifiable
homicides have been eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement
agency reports, the FBI estimates that 528,648 murders were committed
from 1976 to 2001. Agencies provided detailed information on 480,455
victims and 532,177 offenders. 

National coverage is quite high (about 91 percent of homicides are
included in the SHR). However, adjustments can be made to the weights
to correct for missing reports. Estimates from the SHR used in this report
were generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) using a weight
developed by BJS that reconciles the counts of SHR homicide victims
with those in the UCR for the 1992 through 2001 data years. The weight is
the same for all cases for a given year. The weight represents the ratio of
the number of homicides reported in the UCR to the number reported in
the SHR. For additional information about SHR, contact:

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal
(WISQARS™Fatal) 

WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to injury. The mortality
data reported in WISQARS Fatal come from death certificate data reported
to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Data include causes of death reported by attending
physicians, medical examiners, and coroners.

It also includes demographic information about decedents reported by
funeral directors who obtain that information from family members and
other informants. NCHS collects, compiles, verifies, and prepares these
data for release to the public. The data provide information about what
types of injuries are leading causes of deaths, how common they are, and
who they affect. These data are intended for a broad audience—the public,
the media, public health practitioners and researchers, and public health
officials—to increase their knowledge of injury. 

WISQARS Fatal mortality reports provide tables of the total numbers of
injury-related deaths and the death rates per 100,000 U.S. population. The
reports list deaths according to cause (mechanism) and intent (manner) of
injury by state, race, Hispanic origin, sex, and age groupings. For more

National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) 

The National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is one
component of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), an
epidemiological surveillance system developed by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor the prevalence of youth
behaviors that most influence health. The YRBS focuses on priority
health-risk behaviors established during youth that result in the most
significant mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems during
both youth and adulthood. This report uses 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001,
and 2003 YRBS data. 

The YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce a
nationally representative sample of students in grades 9–12 in the United
States. The target population consisted of all public and private school
students in grades 9–12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The
first-stage sampling frame included selecting primary sampling units
(PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and the relative
percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are
either large counties or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second
stage, schools were selected with probability proportional to school
enrollment size. 

Schools with substantial numbers of Black and Hispanic students were
sampled at relatively higher rates than all other schools. The final stage of
sampling consisted of randomly selecting within each chosen school at
each grade 9–12 one or two intact classes of a required subject, such as
English or social studies. All students in selected classes were eligible to
participate. Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, and
15,200 students were selected to participate in the 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999,
2001, and 2003 surveys, respectively. 

The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60 percent
for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the
1999 survey, 63 percent for the 2001 survey, and 67 percent for the 2003
survey. NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for
cross-sectional surveys and bias analyses are called for by NCES when
that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias
analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis
are not available. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse
and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample. The
final weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of
students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national
population projections. Where YRBS data are presented, accurate national
population projections are provided from the Digest of Education
Statistics. 

In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and
Budget’s standards for the classification of federal data on race and
ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version of
the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 was: 

How do you describe yourself? 
1. White - not Hispanic
2. Black - not Hispanic
3. Hispanic or Latino
4. Asian or Pacific Islander 
5. American Indian or Alaskan Native 
6. Other

The version used in 1999, 2001, and 2003 was:

How do you describe yourself? (Select one or more responses.)
A. American Indian or Alaska Native 
B. Asian
C. Black or African American 
D. Hispanic or Latino
E. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 
F. White

This new version of the question used in 1999, 2001, and 2003 results in
the possibility of respondents marking more than one category. While
more accurately reflecting respondents’ racial and ethnic identity, the
new item cannot be directly compared to responses to the old item. A
recent study by Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing
students to select more than one response to the race/ethnicity question on
the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ethnicity among
high school students.

Accuracy of Estimates
 
The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint effects of
nonsampling and sampling errors. Both types of error affect the estimates
presented in this report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling
errors. For example, members of the population of interest are
inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse
to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the
survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during
data editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ
from the "true" responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or
questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to
measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item
nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample
weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or
gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult. 

Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather
than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject
to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from
those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant
population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and
procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation
due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a
particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics
can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two
statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample
is large enough so that it represents the population difference.

Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling
designs rather than a simple random design. The features of complex
sampling require different techniques to calculate standard errors than are
used for data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore,
calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are markedly
different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random
sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced
repeated replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the
statistics and their standard errors in this report. Figure A.3 lists the
various methods used to compute standard errors for different data sets.

Standard error calculation for data from the National Crime Victimization
Survey and the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series
approximation method using PSU and strata variables available from each
data set.

For statistics based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors were
derived from a formula developed by the U.S. Bureau of the Census,
which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant
parameters that represent the curve fitted to the individual standard errors
calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The
formulas used to compute the adjusted standard errors associated with
percentages or population counts can be found in figure A.3.

Statistical Procedures 

The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical significance to
ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to
sampling variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the
report are statistically significant at the .05 level. Several test procedures
were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature
of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this
report was the Student's t statistic, which tests the difference between two
sample estimates, for example, between males and females. The formula
used to compute the t statistic is as follows:
             E1-E2  (1)
     t  =     se21+se22

where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared and se1 and se2 are
their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for
independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for
example, when comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup
included in the total), a covariance term (i.e., 2*se1*se2) must be added to
the denominator of the formula: 
             E1-E2  (2)
     t  =     se21+se22+2*se1*se2

Once the t value was computed, it was compared with the published tables
of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this report, an
alpha value of 0.05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value
was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two estimates is
statistically significant at the 95 percent level. 

A linear trend test was used when a statement describing a linear trend,
rather than the differences between two discrete categories, was made.
This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of
students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the
percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school
increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with, for
example, student's age as the independent variable and whether a student
was physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test involves
computing the regression coefficient (b) and its corresponding standard
error (se).

 The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96,
the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis
that there is a linear relationship between student's age and being
physically attacked is not rejected. 

When using data sets in which multiple years of data are available, a
Bonferroni adjustment to the significance level was used when one year’s
estimate was compared to another. The Bonferroni adjustment to the
significance level was used to ensure that the significance level for the
tests as a series was at the .05 level. Generally, when multiple statistical
comparisons are made, it becomes increasingly likely that an indication of
a population difference is erroneous. Even when there is no difference in
the population, at an alpha of .05, there is still a 5 percent chance of
concluding that an observed t value representing one comparison in the
sample is large enough to be statistically significant. As the number of
years and thus the number of comparisons increase, so does the risk of
making such an erroneous inference. The Bonferroni procedure corrects
the significance (or alpha) level for the total number of comparisons made
within a particular classification variable. For each classification variable,
there are (K*(K-1)/2) possible comparisons (or nonredundant pairwise
combinations), where K is the number of categories. The Bonferroni
procedure divides the alpha level for a single t test by the number of
possible pairwise comparisons in order to produce a new alpha level that is
corrected for the fact that multiple contrasts are being made. As a result,
the t value for a certain alpha level (e.g., .05) increases, which makes it
more difficult to claim that the difference observed is statistically
significant. 

While many descriptive comparisons in this report were tested using t
statistic or the F statistic, some comparisons among categories of an
ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend
across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of
categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were
examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the
two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear
contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable.
The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that
were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the
means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition total sum
of squares into within- and between-group sums of squares. These were
used to create mean squares for the within- and between-group variance
components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then
compared with published values of F for a significance level of .05.
Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear
contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between
the two variables. 


GLOSSARY OF TERMS

General Terms

Cluster sampling - Cluster sampling is a technique in which the sampling
of respondents or subjects occurs within clusters or groups. For example,
selecting students by sampling schools and the students that attend that
school.
 
Crime - Any violation of a statute or regulation or any act that the
government has determined is injurious to the public, including felonies
and misdemeanors. Such violation may or may not involve violence, and it
may affect individuals or property. 

Incident - A specific criminal act or offense involving one or more victims
and one or more offenders. 

Multistage sampling - A survey sampling technique in which there is more
than one wave of sampling. That is, one sample of units is drawn, and then
another sample is drawn within that sample. For example, at the first stage,
a number of Census blocks may be sampled out of all the Census blocks in
the United States. At the second stage, households are sampled within the
previously sampled Census blocks. 

Prevalence - The percentage of the population directly affected by crime in
a given period. This rate is based upon specific information elicited
directly from the respondent regarding crimes committed against his or her
person, against his or her property, or against an individual bearing a
unique relationship to him or her. It is not based upon perceptions and
beliefs about, or reactions to, criminal acts. 

School An - education institution consisting of one or more of grades K
through 12. 

School crime - Any criminal activity that is committed on school property. 

School year - The 12-month period of time denoting the beginning and
ending dates for school accounting purposes, usually from July 1 through
June 30. 

Stratification - A survey sampling technique in which the target population
is divided into mutually exclusive groups or strata based on some variable
or variables (e.g., metropolitan area) and sampling of units occurs
separately within each stratum. 

Unequal probabilities - A survey sampling technique in which sampled
units do not have the same probability of selection into the sample. For
example, the investigator may over-sample minority students in order to
increase the sample sizes of minority students. Minority students would
then be more likely than other students to be sampled. 


Specific Terms Used in Various Surveys 

National Crime Victimization Survey 

Aggravated assault - Attack or attempted attack with a weapon, regardless
of whether or not an injury occurs, and attack without a weapon when
serious injury results.
 
At school (students) - Inside the school building, on school property
(school parking area, play area, school bus, etc.), or on the way to or from
school. 

At school (teachers) - Inside the school building, on school property
(school parking area, play area, school bus, etc.), at worksite, or while
working. For thefts, "while working" was not considered, since thefts of
teachers’ property kept at school can occur when teachers are not present. 

Rape - Forced sexual intercourse including both psychological coercion, as
well as physical force. Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or
oral penetration by the offender(s). Includes attempts and verbal threats of
rape. This category also includes incidents where the penetration is from a
foreign object such as a bottle. 

Robbery - Completed or attempted theft, directly from a person, of
property or cash by force or threat of force, with or without a weapon, and
with or without injury. 

Rural - A place not located inside the Metropolitan Statistical Area
(MSA). This category includes a variety of localities, ranging from
sparsely populated rural areas to cities with populations of less than
50,000. 
Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated assault. 

Sexual assault - A wide range of victimizations, separate from rape or
attempted rape. These crimes include attacks or attempted attacks
generally involving unwanted sexual contact between the victim and
offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve force and includes such
things as grabbing or fondling. Sexual assault also includes verbal threats. 

Simple assault - Attack without a weapon resulting either in no injury,
minor injury, or an undetermined injury requiring less than 2 days of
hospitalization. Also includes attempted assault without a weapon. 

Suburban - A county or counties containing a central city, plus any
contiguous counties that are linked socially and economically to the central
city. On the data tables, suburban areas are categorized as those portions of
metropolitan areas situated "outside central cities." 

Theft - Completed or attempted theft of property or cash without personal
contact. 

Urban - The largest city (or grouping of cities) in an MSA. 

Victimization -  A crime as it affects one individual person or household.
For personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal to the number
of victims involved. The number of victimizations may be greater than the
number of incidents because more than one person may be victimized
during an incident. 

Victimization rate - A measure of the occurrence of victimizations among
a specific population group. 

Violent crime - Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or
simple assault. 

School Crime Supplement 

At school - In the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or
going to or from school. 

Serious violent crime - Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated
assault. 

Total victimization - Combination of violent victimization and theft. If a
student reported an incident of either type, he or she is counted as having
experienced any victimization. If the student reported having experienced
both, he or she is counted once under "total victimization."
 
Violent crime -  Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or
simple assault. 

School Survey on Crime and Safety 

At school/at your school - Includes activities that happened in school
buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that held
school-sponsored events or activities. Unless otherwise specified,
respondents were requested to report on activities that occurred during
normal school hours or when school activities/events were in session. 

Cult or extremist group -  A group that espouses radical beliefs and
practices, which may include a religious component, that are widely seen
as threatening the basic values and cultural norms of society at large. 

Firearm/explosive device - Any weapon that is designed to (or may readily
be converted to) expel a projectile by the action of an explosive. This
includes guns, bombs, grenades, mines, rockets, missiles, pipe bombs, or
similar devices designed to explode and capable of causing bodily harm or
property damage. 

Gang - An ongoing loosely organized association of three or more persons,
whether formal or informal, that has a common name, signs, symbols, or
colors, whose members engage, either individually or collectively, in
violent or other forms of illegal behavior. 

Insubordination -  A deliberate and inexcusable defiance of or refusal to
obey a school rule, authority, or a reasonable order. It includes but is not
limited to direct defiance of school authority, failure to attend assigned
detention or on-campus supervision, failure to respond to a call slip, and
physical or verbal intimidation/abuse. 

Intimidation - To frighten, compel, or deter by actual or implied threats. It
includes bullying and sexual harassment. 

Physical attack or fight - An actual and intentional touching or striking of
another person against his or her will, or the intentional causing of bodily
harm to an individual.
 
Rape - Forced sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal, or oral penetration).
Includes penetration from a foreign object.
 
Robbery - The taking or attempting to take anything of value that is owned
by another person or organization, under confrontational circumstances by
force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear. A
key difference between robbery and theft/larceny is that a threat or battery
is involved in robbery. 

Serious violent incidents- Include rape, sexual battery other than rape,
physical attacks or fights with a weapon, threats of physical attack with a
weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.
 
Sexual battery An incident that includes threatened rape, fondling,
indecent liberties, child molestation, or sodomy. Principals were instructed
that classification of these incidents should take into consideration the age
and developmentally appropriate behavior of the offenders. 

Sexual harassment - Unsolicited, offensive behavior that inappropriately
asserts sexuality over another person. The behavior may be verbal or
nonverbal. 

Specialized school - A school that is specifically for students who were
referred for disciplinary reasons. The school may also have students who
were referred for other reasons. The school may be at the same location as
the respondent’s school. 

Theft/larceny -  Taking things over $10 without personal confrontation.
Specifically, the unlawful taking of another person’s property without
personal confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm. Included are
pocket picking, stealing purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force
was used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor
vehicle or motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft of bicycles, theft from
vending machines, and all other types of thefts. 

Vandalism - The willful damage or destruction of school property
including bombing, arson, graffiti, and other acts that cause property
damage. Includes damage caused by computer hacking. 

Violent incidents   Include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical
attacks or fights with or without a weapon, threats of physical attack with
or without a weapon, robbery with or without a weapon. 

Weapon -  Any instrument or object used with the intent to threaten,
injure, or kill. Includes look-alikes if they are used to threaten others.


School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study 

Homicide - An act involving a killing of one person by another resulting
from interpersonal violence.

School-associated violent death - A homicide or suicide in which the fatal
injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary
school in the United States, while the victim was on the way to or from
regular sessions at such a school, or while the victim was attending or
traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims included
