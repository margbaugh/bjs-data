Methodology 

Appendix:  Table list and index 


Jail population growth slowed in the late 1990's

The Nation's confined jail population increased 32% in the 6
years between censuses, from 459,804 at midyear 1993 to 605,943
at midyear 1999.

Following annual percentage increases in double digits (12.7%)
during the 1980's, growth in the number of confined jail inmates
slowed to single-digit rates in the late 1990's (4.7%).  

Relative to the U.S. resident population, the jail population
more than doubled in 16 years, from 96 inmates per 100,000
residents in 1983 to 222 per 100,000 residents in 1999.  At
midyear 1999 nearly 1 in every 450 U.S. residents were in a
local jail.

In the 12 months preceding the 1999 census, the Nation's jails
had an average daily population of 607,978, up 30% from the
12-month period reported in the 1993 census.

A total of 9,458 persons under age 18 were detained in adult
jails on June 30, 1999.  About 4 out of every 5 juveniles 
in jail had been convicted or were being held for trial as 
adults in criminal court.  (See Methodology for changes
in the definition of juvenile.) 

The 2000 Annual Survey of Jails  provides updated inmate and
facility characteristics

In each of the years between the full censuses, a sample survey
of jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of
the Nation's jails and the inmates housed in the jails.  

Findings from the 2000 survey include--

*In the 12 months since the 1999 census, the number of inmates
increased to 621,149 (up 2.5%).

*The rate of incarceration rose to  226 per 100,000 U.S.
residents, the equivalent of 1 in every 376 residents on June
30, 2000.

*In the 12 months ending June 30, 2000, the Nation's jails added
25,466 beds -- resulting in a 92% occupancy rate at midyear,
the lowest level since 1984. 

*The number of persons under age 18 housed in adult jail
facilities dropped to 7,615 on June 30, 2000.

*The average daily population for the year ending June 30, 2000,
was 618,319, an increase of 1.7% from 1999.

A few States housed a majority of inmates 

In 1999 approximately half of all jail inmates were held in 7
States:  California, 77,142; Texas, 57,930; Florida, 51,080; New
York, 34,411; Georgia, 32,835; Pennsylvania, 26,996; and
Louisiana, 25,631.  The 10 States with the smallest
jail populations each held fewer than 3,000 inmates.  Together,
jails in these States held 3% of the Nation's jail population.

These locally operated facilities --

*receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them awaiting
trial, conviction, or sentencing

*readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and
absconders

*temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to juvenile
authorities

*hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to 
appropriate health facilities

*hold individuals for the military, for protective custody, 
for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses

*release convicted inmates to the community upon completion 
of sentence


*transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other authorities

*house inmates for Federal, State, or other authorities 
because of crowding of their facilities

*relinquish custody of temporary detainees to juvenile and
medical authorities

*operate community-based programs with day reporting, home
detention, electronic  monitoring or other types of 
supervision

*hold inmates sentenced to short terms (generally under 
1 year).

Louisiana had the largest number of jail inmates per 100,000
State residents (585), followed by Georgia (421), Tennessee
(358), and Florida (337).  Four States -- Maine (with 89 inmates
per 100,000 resident), North Dakota (92), Iowa (104), and
Minnesota (105) -- had rates that were less than half of the
national rate.  

In 5 States the jail population rose  more than 75% between
censuses

Since the last census was conducted in 1993, the jail
populations more than doubled in Montana (up 124%), Utah (112%),
and Wyoming (103%), and increased by more than 75% in Iowa (87%)
and Mississippi (83%).  Growth was the slowest in the largest
States, up 5% in Texas, up 11% in California and New Jersey, 
and up 12% in New York. The District of Columbia recorded a 
2% decline due in part to the housing of inmates outside the
District.

Over the entire 16 years, between the 1983 and 1999 censuses,
all but 6 jurisdictions had at least a doubling in their jail
populations. The exceptions were Missouri, which had an 83%
increase; Alaska, 84%; California, 85%; Illinois, 91%; and
Maine, 99%.  

Between 1983 and 1999 jail populations increased the most in
Wisconsin (314%), Utah (344%), Idaho (365%),  and Nevada (421%). 

Nearly half of all inmates were held in jails with an average
daily population of 1,000 or more

Most jail inmates were held in relatively few large jails. 
While almost two-thirds of the jails had a capacity for 100 
or fewer inmates, nearly half of all detainees in 1999 were 
housed in jails with an average daily population of 1,000 
or more inmates. About 12% of inmates were in facilities 
holding fewer than 100 inmates. 

The growing dominance of very large jails was especially 
marked during the period.  The percentage of inmates in 
jails holding 2,000 or more nearly doubled from about 17% 
in 1993 to 30% in 1999, while the percentage in jails 
holding fewer than 100 dropped from 16% to 12%.

Characteristics of jail inmates slowly changing 


In 1993 men comprised 90.4% of the jail population, and women
9.6%.  Six years later the male proportion was 88.8% and the
female proportion, 11.2%.  An estimated 1 in every 181 adult 
men and 1 in every 1,538 adult women were held in local jail 
on June 30, 1999.  

Between 1993 and 1999, the number of white non-Hispanics
increased from 39.3% to 41.3%; black non-Hispanics decreased
from 44.2% to 41.5%; Hispanics increased from 15.1% to 15.5%;
and American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians, and Pacific
Islanders increased from 1.3% to 1.7%.

Compared to 1993, a higher percentage of inmates in 1999 were
awaiting trial rather than serving a sentence

The percentage of convicted adult inmates decreased from 50% 
in 1993 to 46% in 1999, while that of unconvicted adults 
increased from approximately 50% to 54%.  Convicted inmates 
include those awaiting or serving a sentence, and those who 
were returned to jail for a violation of probation or parole.
Between 1993 and 1999 the number of unconvicted inmates rose 
by 40% (from 228,900 to 321,000), while the number of 
convicted rose by 22% (from 226,600 to 275,500).

Facility capacity kept pace with growth in jail population

Rated capacity increased 37% from 1993 to 1999.  Rated capacity
is the maximum number of beds or inmates allocated by rating
officials to each jail facility.  Facility expansion averaged
29,516 new spaces, or 5.4% annually -- equivalent to the
addition of  510 beds each week during the 6-year period.  The
largest annual growth in capacity occurred in 1995 when more
than 41,400 spaces were added, followed by 1999 (39,500). The
smallest growth year was 1986 when jail capacity expanded by
about 17,208 beds.

As measured by a ratio of the number of inmates housed in 
jails to the rated capacity, occupancy ranged from 92% to 97%
between 1993 and 1999.  According to this measure, facility 
expansion kept pace with the growth of the inmate population.  
After beginning the period at 97% of capacity occupied, jail 
capacity outpaced growth in the jail population.  By 1996 
jails were operating at 8% below their rated capacity, the 
lowest level recorded during the 6-year period.

Throughout the period from 1983 to 1999 jail occupancy rates
were inversely related to facility size.  The smallest jails 
had the lowest percent of capacity occupied and the largest 
had the highest percent.

In 1999 facilities that housed fewer than 50 inmates were
occupied at 71% of capacity, whereas those that held 1,000 or
more were occupied at 97%.  

Between 1983 and 1988 occupancy increased among all jails,
irrespective of size.  After 1988 the smallest facilities
experienced an increasing percentage of capacity occupied, 
while larger jails had a decreasing percentage of capacity 
occupied. Among facilities housing 1,000 or more inmates, 
occupancy fell from 126% in 1988 to 97% in 1999.  During 
this period these larger facilities accounted for an 
increasing percentage of inmates.  



In 1999 the total jail population exceeded rated capacity 
in 7 States and the District of Columbia:

                         Percent of 
State                    capacity occupied

District of Columbia          120%      
Virginia                      118
New Jersey                    110
Massachusetts                 108
Kentucky                      105
Washington                    105
California                    103
Indiana                       102

In every other State the total jail population was below the
combined capacity of all jails.  Excluding Alaska, 6 States 
had occupancies below 80%: 

                 Percent of 
State            capacity occupied

North Dakota          64%

Utah                  68
Missouri              78
Kansas                79
Arkansas              79

Between 1993 and 1999, while the total capacity of the Nation's
jails grew 37%, 6 States had jail capacity increases of 70% or
more: Virginia (70%); Arizona (71%); Mississippi (83%); New
Mexico (87%); Idaho (90%); and Utah (102%).

About 219,000 persons were admitted to jail during the week
before the 1999 census

Jail authorities responding to previous censuses had difficulty
separating inmates categorized as new entries from inmates
returning from court appearances, medical appointments, work
release, and escape.  The 1999 census clarified what was meant
by entries -- new admissions to jail on a given charge -- and
asked for only those occurring from June 24 to June 30, 1999.

A total of 2,610 jail jurisdictions, or 85%, reported 193,880
new admissions to their facilities for the week in June 1999. 
Overall, about 219,000 persons entered jails, including the
reported admissions and an estimate based on the population of
the nonreporting jurisdictions.

c/See Methodology for estimation procedure.

The number of jail jurisdictions under court order or consent
decree declined from 1993 to 1999

Among 2,838 local jail jurisdictions reporting data at midyear
1999, about 15% were under court order or consent decree (most
often for crowding or other confinement conditions), and 11%
were ordered to limit population.  By comparison, at midyear
1993, among 2,945 reporting jurisdictions about 17% were under
court order or consent decree and 14% were ordered to limit
population. 

Approximately 1 in every 8 persons under jail supervision was
supervised outside of a jail facility

Many jail authorities also have responsibility for supervising
offenders outside of jail facilities in programs such as
community service, work release, weekend reporting, electronic
monitoring, and other alternative programs.  At midyear 1999
jail authorities supervised 82,030 offenders in such 
community-based programs, up from 25,174 in 1993.  These counts
excluded offenders under the supervision of probation, parole,
or other correctional agencies.  Also excluded were inmates
allowed to work in the community during the day but required to
return to jail at night.

Total under 
supervision, 1999                 687,973

  Confined                        605,943

Home detention                        516
Other programs                      8,367

Among persons under community supervision by jail staff in 
1999, more than two-thirds performed community service (25%),
participated in a weekend reporting program, worked in the
community during the week (20%), were under pretrial supervision
(12%), or were under electronic monitoring (12%).  These
offenders supervised outside of jail doubled from about 6% 
of the jail population in 1993 to 12% in 1999.

The number of privately operated jails and inmates in them
increased during the 1990's

Between 1993 and 1999 the number of private jails operated under
contract to local government authorities increased from 17 to 47.  
During this period the number of persons under private jail 
supervision rose from 3,229 to 16,656.  However, in 1999 
private facilities still accounted for 1.4% of all jails
and 2.4% of all persons under jail supervision.

Most private jails housed both men and women, although 15 
held men only and 2 women only.  These contract facilities 
ranged in size from very small to very large, but those 
holding fewer than 50 inmates or between 250 and 499 were 
the most common.

Like the inmate population in publicly operated jails, the
private jail population was largely male (89%).  Black inmates
made up 38% of the total private population, whites 31%,
Hispanics, 16%, and persons with other or unspecified racial
classifications, 15%.

Texas led the Nation in private jail operations with
approximately a fifth of all inmates and facilities.  
Tennessee had the second-largest number of inmates (2,278), 
followed by Florida (1,931).

Missouri              1               23

The number of persons employed in private jails more than
tripled from 1,243 in 1993 to 4,178 in 1999.  About 54% of the
staff in 1999 were men, and 46% women.  Correctional officers
comprised about 63% of all private staff.  By comparison, among
the Nation's total jail staff, correctional officers made up
about 72%.

Most jails charged fees to house inmates for other 
correctional authorities

Approximately 71% of all jail jurisdictions charged fees to
house inmates for other correctional authorities in 1999. 
Thirteen percent did not charge, 6% did not hold inmates for
other authorities, and 10% did not report on fee policies. 

Daily per-inmate fees were an average $48 for Federal inmates,
$36 for State inmates, and $38 for inmates held for other local
jails.  Charges for Federal detainees ranged from $26 per day in
Alabama to $105 in Alaska.  Charges for housing inmates for
State authorities ranged from $4 per day in Alabama to $100 in
Alaska.  Fees charged for housing inmates for other local
authorities ranged from $8 in Louisiana to $79 in Alaska.     

5% of the Nation's jail inmates not U.S. citizens

On June 30, 1999, approximately 5% of jail inmates were 
known to be non-citizens.  Based on 2,648 jail jurisdictions 
reporting data, non-U.S. citizens totaled more than 24,000 
inmates.  Jails in California reported the largest number of 
non-citizens (8,183 inmates), followed by jails in Texas 
(3,330) and New York (1,549).  As a percentage of all inmates,
non-citizens were the most frequent among jails reporting 
data in New Hampshire (16%), California (14%), and Nevada (13%).

****************** Box:  Federal jails *********************

11 Federal jails held 11,209 inmates on June 30, 1999

During the 1990's the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) maintained
a small number of detention facilities that functioned as jails.
 These were not included among the city, county, or regional
adult detention facilities identified as jails in this report. 
On June 30, 1999, BOP operated 11 jails that held 11,209 persons
awaiting adjudication or transfer, up from 7 jails and 5,899
inmates at midyear 1993.  See Appendix tables for additional
information on Federal jail characteristics.

At the time of the 1999 Census of Jails, the Nation's local
jails also housed at least 29,000 persons for Federal
authorities, including the U.S. Marshals Service, the Federal
Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service,
and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 

Inmate demographics

Ninety-three percent of Federal jail inmates in 1999 were men,
the same as 6 years earlier.  Sixty-three percent were white,
32% black, and 5% were American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians,
or Pacific Islanders.

Conviction status

Approximately 74% of the Federal inmates were unconvicted --
awaiting arraignment, trial, or the completion of their trial. 
By comparison, about 53% of Federal jail inmates were
unconvicted at midyear, 1993.

Facility capacity

The 11 Federal jails had an aggregate rated capacity of 
8,040 on June 30, 1999, resulting in an occupancy rate 39% 
over capacity.  In 1993 occupancy exceeded capacity by 55%.

Inmate deaths

Fifteen inmates died while under the jurisdiction of Federal
jail authorities during the annual period ending June 30, 
1999. Ten males died from natural causes, 4 from suicide, 
and 1 from AIDS.

Staff

Seventy-five percent of Federal jail employees were male, 
the same proportion as in 1993.  Slightly over half were
correctional officers. 

Despite a 55% increase in total staff and a 90% increase in
Federal jail inmates between 1993 and 1999, the reported 
number of clerical and maintenance employees decreased from 
263 to 93, and educational employees increased from 26 to 30.  
However, the number of workers classified as professional 
and technical nearly doubled from 551 to 1,049.

Overall, there were 3.6 inmates per Federal jail employee in
1999, up from 2.9 at the time of the previous census.  The
number of inmates per correctional officer also rose from 5.5 in
1993 to 6.7 in 1999.  By comparison, in local jails in 1999, 
the ratio of inmates to total staff was 2.9 to 1; and among
correctional officers, 4.3 to 1.

About a third of jail jurisdictions reported inmate assaults 
on staff 

Between July 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999, there were 9,276 
inmate physical or sexual assaults on jail employees in 848 
jail jurisdictions.  The total number of assaults compared to the
average daily population translated into 17.8 assaults per 
1,000 inmates during the 12-month period.

*Based on the average daily population of 522,488 in 2,738
jurisdictions that reported  data on inmate-on-staff assaults.
Per 1,000 employees there were 48.8 assaults by jail inmates,
based on a total staff of 189,984 in jurisdictions reporting
data on such assaults.

Between July 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999, four jail employees
died as a result of assaults by inmates.  Two of the four 
staff deaths resulted from inmate assaults occurring in 
Indiana, one in Iowa, and one in California.

In the 12 months prior to the census, 919 inmates died in 
local jails, up from 647 prior to the 1993 census

A total of 919 inmate deaths were reported in jails during the
12-month period ending June 30, 1999, up from 647 during a
similar period preceding the 1993 census.  The causes
of death in 1999 were distributed similarly to those in 1993. 
In 1999 the most common cause of death was illness or natural
cause excluding AIDS (42%), followed by suicide (35%), AIDS
(9%), and homicide (3%).  The remaining 11% were from other or
unspecified causes.

Overall, 16% of jail jurisdictions reported at least one inmate
death during the 12-month period, 11% reported only one inmate
death, and 5% reported two or more deaths.

*Based on 3,079 jurisdictions reporting  
data on inmate deaths.             

While the number of deaths increased by 42% between the 1993 
and 1999 censuses, the overall rate of death per 100,000 
inmates based on the average daily population remained 
nearly unchanged -- 154 in 1999, compared to 149 in 1993.  The 
rates of death by specific cause also remained nearly unchanged.  
In 1999 the rate of death due to illness/natural causes totaled 
64 deaths per 100,000 inmates, and the rate of suicide totaled 
54 per 100,000. 

About 7 in every 10 jail employees supervised inmates or
provided facility security

Jails employed an estimated 207,600 persons at midyear 1999.  
This total, which included both full-time and part-time, 
payroll and nonpayroll staff, grew 42,100 between 1993 and 
1999, an increase of 25%.  During this same period the 
number of jail inmates increased 32%.

In 1999 most jail staff were payroll employees (98%) and 
working full-time (95%).  Of the estimated 207,600 staff,  
5,200 employees were nonpayroll, including staff on the 
payroll of other governmental agencies.

More than 1 in 4 jail jurisdictions reported that they also 
had staff paid through contractual agreements.  On June 30, 
1999, jail jurisdictions employed an additional 11,700 staff 
through contractual agreements.   

Correctional officers, employees who directly supervise 
inmates and provide facility security, reached 149,600 in 1999.  
Their proportion scarcely changed from about 71% of all staff in 
1993 to 72% in 1999.  Other occupational categories varied 
only slightly during the 6-year period:  Administrators were 
about 7% in both years; clerical and maintenance workers 
declined slightly from 13% to 12%; professional and technical 
employees went from 7% to 5%; and educational employees accounted for
about 1% in 1993 and 1999.

Women comprised a third of all jail employees; a quarter of
correctional officers

Women accounted for about 34% of all jail employees in 1999, 
up from 30% of payroll staff in 1993.  On June 30, 1999, an
estimated 70,700 women were employed in local jails.

Among the 149,600 correctional officers in 1999, women comprised
28% (a slight increase from 1993, when they comprised 24% of
payroll correctional officers).

Minorities accounted for an increasing percentage of jail staff 

In 1999 about 66% of jail staff were white; 24% black; 8%
Hispanic; and 2% other races.  By comparison, in 1993, 71% of
jail employees were white; 22% black; 6% Hispanic; and 1% other
races.  The racial and ethnic distributions of correctional
officers were similar to that of the total staff; however, a
slightly higher percentage of correctional officers was black
(26%). 

In both years, minority employees were under-represented
relative to their proportion among inmates.  In 1999, 42% 
of all inmates were black and 15% were Hispanic.

The number of jail employees grew faster than the number of
inmates between 1983 and 1999

Jail staff grew more rapidly than inmate population between 
1983 and 1993. As a result, the number of inmates per employee
declined from 3.5 in 1983 to 3.4 in 1988, to 2.8 in 1993.  
During the 1990's, the number of inmates rose faster than
staff, and the ratio rose slightly to 2.9 in 1999.  

This pattern of growth was also true for correctional officers
relative to the inmate population.  After declining from  5.0
inmates per correctional officer in 1983 to 3.9 in 1993, the
ratio rose to 4.3 in 1999.  

The pattern of declining inmate-to-staff ratios during the
1980's and slightly rising ratios in the 1990's was consistent
across regions except the West. In this region the ratio
continued to decline from 3.4 inmates per employee in 1993 to
3.3 in 1999.

Most jails had policies or programs for inmate education,
counseling, and health services

Over half the Nation's jail jurisdictions operated secondary
education programs for inmates, and a quarter, basic adult
education programs.  Eleven percent of jurisdictions
offered special education for inmates with learning
disabilities, and somewhat fewer had study release (9%), a
vocational program (6%), and college courses (3%). 
Approximately 45,800 inmates, or 8% of all detainees in
jurisdictions providing data, were participating in jail
education programs on June 30, 1999. 

Religious or spiritual counseling programs were available in
over two-thirds of jail jurisdictions; alcohol and drug
dependency or awareness in more than half; and psychological
counseling in slightly less than half.  Fewer jurisdictions
offered life skills (21%), counseling about domestic violence
(17%), pretrial services (17%), and guidance for job seeking
(15%).

Over two-thirds of all jail jurisdictions used a fee-for-
service (39%) plan or on-site staff (31%) to deliver inmate 
health care. Among the more common mental health services 
were inmate screenings at intake (78% of jurisdictions), 
psychotropic medication (66%), 24-hour care (47%), routine 
therapy or counseling (45%), and psychiatric evaluation (39%).   

Methodology

Census of Jails

The Census of Jails, 1999, was the seventh in a series of data
collections intended to study the Nation's jails.  Previous
censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, 1988, and
1993.  As in previous enumerations, the U.S. Census Bureau
collected the data for the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

The 1999 census included all locally administered jails that
held inmates beyond arraignment (usually more than 72 hours) and
that were staffed by municipal or county employees.  The census
also included 47 private jails operating under contract to
governments; 42 regional jails operated for two or more jail
authorities; and 11 Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities that
functioned as jails.  

Excluded from the census were physically separate temporary
holding facilities, such as drunk tanks and police lockups, that
do not hold persons after they are formally charged in court
(usually within 72 hours of arrest).  Also excluded were
State-operated facilities in Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii,
Rhode Island, Vermont, and Alaska, which have combined
jail-prison systems.  Fifteen independently operated jails in
Alaska, however, were included.

The mailout used for the census was derived from a facility list
maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau for BJS, correctional
association directories, and other secondary sources.  Census
questionnaires were mailed to 3,160 jail jurisdictions on June
25, 1999.  In addition to a paper form, BJS offered respondents
in large jurisdictions an electronic version via the Internet,
which allowed them to complete and submit their questionnaire
on-line. Six jurisdictions were added to the initial mailout,
and 82 were deleted, resulting in a total of 3,084 jail
jurisdictions. 

Extensive follow up in the form of mail and fax reminders, and
repeated telephone contacts resulted in a nearly 100% response
rate for the following critical data items:  gender of inmates
held; number of inmates on June 30, 1999; male and female
inmates under age 18; male and female inmates age 18 and older;
jail rated capacity; number of jail deaths during the preceding
12 months; and total number of staff.

Of the 3,084 jurisdictions in the final universe, 251 provided
information on critical data items only.  Data from six
jurisdictions that did not respond to any items on the
questionnaire were imputed based on previous survey 
and census reports.  

Estimation procedures

Because there was nonresponse and incomplete data on census
items other than the seven critical items, national totals had
to be estimated.  The following procedures were used to estimate
totals when data were incomplete:

1.  Each item was assessed for coverage and internal
consistency.  To estimate totals, extreme values were examined
and verified by checking other census information and originally
submitted forms.  Detailed categories were also checked to
determine if they summed to the reported totals.

2. To provide national and State total estimates of staff, item
values were summed and then multiplied by a nonresponse
adjustment factor (NAF).  The NAF was a ratio of the total
number of inmates in all jails to the number of inmates in jails
that reported valid staff data.

Estimates of total admissions in each State were based on a
ratio of the total number of inmates held in all facilities.  to
number of inmates in jurisdictions reporting at least one
admission. Estimated State total admissions were then rounded to
whole numbers and summed to regional totals, and then regional
totals were summed to provide a national estimate.

3. All estimates were rounded to the nearest 100.

4. All rates, ratios, and percentage distributions were based
on reported data only.

Juveniles

Most, but not all, States define a  juvenile as a person 
under age 18 who is subject to juvenile court jurisdiction. 
Exceptions usually depend on offense severity or an offender's
adjudication history.

Statutes and judicial practices sometimes allow youths to be
held in adult jails.  Often juveniles accused of acts that are
crimes for adults may be held in jails or police lockups, given
certain conditions: 

*separation by sight and sound from the general population
*detention for a limited time, typically less than 6 hours.

In annual jail surveys beginning in 1994 and in the 1999 census,
jail authorities were asked to report the number of inmates
under age 18.  Of the 9,458 persons under age 18 being held in
jail on June 30, 1999, 91% were identified as juveniles tried or
scheduled to be tried as adults.
