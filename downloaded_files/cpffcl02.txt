Highlights
                     
*  A total of 351 publicly funded forensic crime laboratories operated 
in the United States as of yearend 2002. This total includes 203 State 
or regional labs, 65 county, 50 municipal, and 33 Federal labs.

*  A typical laboratory in 2002 had 2 managers, 2 secretaries or clerks,
12 analysts, and 2 technicians. The median laboratory operating budget 
in 2002 was $1.3 million.

*  A typical laboratory in 2002 started the year with a backlog of about
390 requests, received 4,900 requests, and completed 4,600 requests.

*  About half of all requests in 2002 were in the area of controlled
substances.

*  Nearly all laboratories employed standard protocols for DNA testing
(98%), controlled substances (98%), and latent prints (97%).

*  Examiners in the Nation's crime laboratories processed requests at or 
above 90% of the expected examiner averages in 8 of 10 categories of 
forensic services.

*  Forty-one percent of publicly funded labs in 2002 reported outsourcing 
one or more types of forensic services to private labs. Overall, labs
outsourced  nearly 240,000 requests for forensic services.  

*  Ninety-one percent of outsourced requests were DNA-related, including
nearly 13,000 casework requests and 205,000 convicted offender samples in 
the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). The median cost of out- sourcing one
CODIS sample was $30.

*  Sixty-one percent of the labs are accredited by the American Society
of Crime Laboratory Directors Lab Accreditation Board (ASCLD-LAB). An
additional 10% are accredited by some other organization.

*  Fifty-five percent of non-Federal labs received some funding from grants 
in 2002.

*  About half (52%) of publicly funded labs in 2002 had resources dedicated 
to training. Twelve percent had resources dedicated to research.

Federal, State, and local forensic crime laboratories employed over
9,300 full-time equivalent (FTE) personnel in 2002 and had total
budgets exceeding $750 million. These publicly funded labs received
nearly 2.7 million new cases, including a much larger number of
separate requests for forensic services during calendar year
2002.***Footnote 1:  A "case" is defined as evidence submitted from a
single criminal investigation.  A case may include multiple "requests"
for forensic services. For example, one case may include a request for
biology screening and a request for latent prints. *** 

These labs ended the year with over 500,000 backlogged requests for
forensic services -- a more than 70% increase in the backlog of
requests compared to the beginning of the year.***Footnote 2: A case
or request is defined as backlogged if it is in the laboratory and
remains unreported for a period of 30 days or more. The backlog
increased in most categories of forensic services.***

The Nation's publicly funded crime labs estimated that about 1,900
additional FTEs would have been needed to achieve a 30-day turnaround for 
all 2002 requests for forensic services.  Based on starting salaries for
analysts or examiners in these labs, the estimated cost of the additional 
FTEs exceeds $70.2 million. 

Over three-quarters of the labs indicated that resources beyond personnel
increases would also have been needed to achieve a 30-day turnaround on 
all 2002 requests. These resource needs included capital expenditures 
for new and renovated laboratory space and facilities; additional and 
updated equipment; instrumentation, robotics, and computers; basic and
advanced training opportunities; and improved Laboratory Information
Management Systems (LIMS). The total estimated cost of these needs 
exceeds $500 million.

Background

Several surveys of crime laboratories have been conducted over the
past 35 years, beginning with the 1967 John Jay College survey of
crime labora- tories.***Footnote 3: A. Joseph, Crime Laboratories –
Three Study Reports, OLEA Projects 013, 140, and 66-3, Washington,
DC: U.S. Department of Justice, 1968.***  Surveys conducted in the
1970's and 1980's***Footnote 4: R. Fox and C. Cunningham, Crime

Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD), Survey of crime
laboratory needs (unpublished), 1998.*** have enumerated laboratory
facilities in the United States, examined the role and impact of
scientific evidence in the investigation and prosecution of criminal
cases, and documented workloads and other administrative data among
 various samples of laboratories.
  
In recent years BJS has surveyed DNA crime laboratories (Survey of
DNA Crime Laboratories, 2001, <http:www. ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/
sdnacl01.htm>). The National Institute of Justice has commissioned
studies of DNA backlog and other topics in the forensic sciences, both
in the United States and abroad (<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/nij> and
<www.dna.gov>).

To obtain current baseline information about the workload and operations 
of the Nation's forensic crime laboratories, BJS in 2003-04 conducted its
first Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories. This report
details the organization, functions, budget, staffing, workload, and
performance expectations of the Nation's publicly funded Federal, State, 
and local forensic crime laboratories currently operating. BJS previously
reported data for the 50 largest publicly funded State and local labs(50
Largest Crime Labs, 2002,<http://www.ojp.usdoj.Gov/bjs/abstract/50lcl.htm>).

As of yearend 2002, 351 publicly funded forensic crime laboratories
operated in the United States. This total includes all labs that
employed at least one full-time scientist whose principal function is
examination of physical evidence for law enforcement agencies and to
provide reports and testimony to courts of law with respect to that
evidence. This report is based on data for 305 responding laboratories, 
unless specifically noted in tables and figures. Data for the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) laboratory division, the Nation's
largest publicly funded forensic crime laboratory, are summarized
separately. (See page 11.) 

Just over half (54%) of the laboratories are units of larger laboratory
systems, and most (90%) of these laboratories serve State or regional
jurisdictions. The census collected information from each lab within
larger laboratory systems.

Personnel

Publicly funded crime laboratories in 2002 employed about 9,400 full-time
equivalent (FTE) personnel.  Most labs were relatively small. For example, 
60% of labs employed fewer than 25 FTE personnel, and 80% employed fewer 
than 50 FTEs.

Just 5% of publicly funded labs had 100 or more FTEs in 2002, but these 
labs employed nearly a quarter (24%) of all FTE personnel.  

Most of the labs (58%) served State or regional jurisdictions. Twenty
percent served county-level jurisdictions, and 15% municipal
jurisdictions. Eight percent served Federal or national jurisdictions.

State or regional laboratories employed 4,797 FTEs, or about half
(51%) of all FTE personnel. County and municipal labs accounted for
1,760 (19%) and 1,746 (19%), respectively. Federal or national labs
employed 1,095 FTEs, or about 12% of the total.

Overall, publicly funded crime labs in 2002 were authorized for a total
of 9,798 FTEs and actually employed 9,397 FTEs, or 96% of the
authorized total.  

Analysts or examiners - persons who typically prepare evidence, conduct 
tests, interpret results, sign laboratory reports, and testify in court -
comprised 60% of all crime lab FTEs in 2002. Technical support personnel, 
who typically assist analysts or examiners in preparing evidence and
conducting tests, accounted for 12% of all FTEs. Twelve percent of FTEs 
were managerial personnel, 9% were in clerical positions, and 6% in
miscellaneous categories.

Analysts or examiners comprise between 55% and 64% of all FTEs across
laboratory size categories.  Likewise, technical support personnel 
range from 9% to 15% of FTEs, managerial personnel range from 10% to 
16% of FTEs, and clerical support personnel range from 8% to 13% of FTEs.  

Similar ranges in the distribution of personnel are evident among labs
by type of jurisdiction served.

A typical laboratory operation has about 18 FTE employees, including
2 managers, 2 secretaries/clerks, 12 analysts, and 2 technicians. 
Among the largest labs -- those having 100 or more FTEs -- a typical
operation has 135 FTEs, including 17 managers, 14 secretaries/clerks,
76 analysts, and 16 technicians.  

Among the smallest labs -- those having fewer than 10 FTEs -- a typical
operation has 6 FTEs, including 1 manager, 1 secretary/clerk, and 3 
analysts. 

Laboratories serving Federal or national jurisdictions tend to be larger
than labs serving other types of jurisdictions, typically employing about
45 FTEs, including 5 managers, 4 secretaries/clerks, 29 analysts, and
6 technicians.  

Laboratory functions

About 90% of laboratories reported they examined controlled substances. 
About two-thirds of laboratories examined firearms and toolmarks (63%),
performed the screening of biological samples (usually in preparation 
for DNA analysis on selected exhibits)(65%), and examined latent prints 
(61%).

Examiners in 62% of laboratories engaged directly in crime scene
investigations; however, most forensic examiners did not visit crime
scenes. When asked who in their jurisdiction performs most major
crime scene investigations, a quarter of the labs indicated that
laboratory scientists doubled as crime scene investigators.  

The majority (62%) of laboratories reported that agencies or persons
separate from the lab handled most major investigations. These
typically include a police unit having specialized evidence technicians
or crime scene search officers who go to such scenes, take photographs, 
and locate, pre-serve, label and gather the physical evidence.  

A much smaller percentage (14%) of laboratories reported that crime
scene investigators operated from their laboratory and have primary
responsibility for processing major crime scene investigations. Most of
these are city or municipal laboratories.

Fifty-nine percent of laboratories examined one or more forms of trace
evidence (such as hairs, fibers, glass, or paint) that may associate
offenders and victims with one another and/or offenders with crime
scenes.

Less common functions were the examination of questioned documents (26% 
of laboratories), and computer crime investigations (11%).  

Larger labs are generally able to handle a broader range of functions. 
Across all labs, the median number of forensic functions performed
was 6, ranging from 3 functions among the smallest labs -- those
having fewer than 10 FTEs -- to 8 functions among the largest labs --
those having 50 or more FTEs.

A majority of larger labs were performing each of the listed functions.
Among the smallest labs, a majority performed two of the listed
functions: controlled substances (84%) and crime scene processing
(57%). 

Labs serving Federal or national jurisdictions were more specialized,
typically performing three forensic functions, while labs serving other
types of jurisdictions typically perform six or seven functions.

About three-quarters of labs serving Federal or national jurisdictions
processed controlled substances (78%) and latent prints (74%).

Workload

Management information systems

Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) manage cases and/or 
evidence. These computer-based systems enable the laboratories to track 
the thousands of cases and items of evidence that they process. A single 
case may result in different forms of evidence undergoing analysis in 
various sections of a crime laboratory.  

Three-quarters of laboratories had LIMS. Labs serving municipal
jurisdictions were less likely to have LIMS (29%), compared to 88% of
labs serving State or regional jurisdictions, 74% of Federal/national
labs, and 69% of county labs.  

Evidence processing

Publicly funded crime laboratories in 2002 received 2,695,269 new
cases -- evidence submitted from a single criminal investigation that
may include multiple requests for forensic services -- and ended the
year with a backlog of 262,637 cases.

Overall, labs received a median 4,429 cases in 2002 and ended the
year with a median backlog of 370 cases.  Larger labs typically
handled more cases; those having 100 or more FTEs received a
median 31,388 cases and ended the year with a median backlog of
3,190 cases.

In contrast, the smallest labs -- those having fewer than 10 FTEs --
received a median 1,997 cases and ended the year with a median
backlog of 101 cases.

Labs serving State or regional jurisdictions received about 1.1 million
cases in 2002 (or 42% of all cases).  The median number of cases
received by these labs was about 4,000 cases.  These labs ended the
year with a backlog of about 145,000 cases -- 55% of the total backlog
-- and the median backlog was about 470 cases. 

Labs serving county jurisdictions received about 791,000 cases in
2002, or 29% of the total. The median number of cases received in
these labs was about 5,800 cases. These labs ended the year with
nearly 59,000 backlogged cases -- 22% of the total -- and the median
backlog was about 520 cases.

Labs serving municipal jurisdictions received about 684,000 cases in
2002 (a quarter of all cases), and had the highest median (about 5,900
cases).  These labs had a yearend backlog of about 50,000 cases -- or
19% of the total -- and had a median backlog of about 150 cases. 

Labs serving Federal or national jurisdictions received about 86,000
cases in 2002, or about 3% of the total, and had the lowest median
(about 1,300 cases). These labs ended the year with nearly 8,800
backlogged cases -- 3% of the total -- and had a median backlog of
about 140 cases.

Publicly funded crime laboratories began 2002 with a backlog of about
290,000 requests for forensic services. These labs received an
additional  2.7 million requests during 2002 and completed nearly 2.5
million requests.  

A typical lab in 2002 had a backlog of about 390 requests, received
4,900 new requests, completed 4,600 requests, and finished the year
with a backlog of about 650 requests (median values).

The total estimated backlog at yearend -- about 501,000 requests --
represents an increase of 211,000 requests, or 73%, from the backlog
at the beginning of the year. Overall, for every five requests completed
by publicly funded crime laboratories in 2002, one request was outstanding 
at yearend.

Seventy-three percent of the total backlogged requests at yearend 2002 
were attributable to controlled substances (46%), latent prints (17%), 
and DNA analysis (10%). 

Controlled substances

Almost half of all new requests (about 1.3 million requests, or 48%) for
analysis were for controlled substances, in the form of pills, powders,
vegetable matter (for example, marijuana), and other residues. 

A typical lab performing analyses of controlled substances received about
3,000 such requests during 2002.

Labs performing controlled substances analysis processed a total of
nearly 1.2 million requests during 2002, with a typical lab completing
about 2,800 requests. These labs ended the year with about 233,000
backlogged requests, or about 290 requests per lab on average.  

Overall, for every five controlled substance requests completed in 2002, 
about one request was outstanding at yearend.

Latent prints

About 274,000 new requests (or 10% of all new requests) were for analysis 
of latent prints. A typical lab performing latent prints analysis received
about 860 such requests during 2002.

Labs performing latent prints analysis processed about 238,000 requests 
during 2002, with a typical lab completing about 790 requests. These labs
ended the year with about 86,000 backlogged requests, or about 140 requests
per lab on average.  

For every three latent print requests completed in 2002, approximately one
request was outstanding at yearend.

DNA analysis

Just 2% of all new requests -- about 61,000 requests -- were in the area of
DNA analysis. A typical lab performing DNA analysis received about 250 such
requests during 2002.

Labs performing DNA analysis processed nearly 42,000 requests, with
a typical lab completing about 170 requests. These labs ended the
year with about 49,000 backlogged requests, or about 130 requests on
average.

For every five DNA analysis requests completed in 2002, approximately 
six requests remained outstanding at yearend.  

As would be expected, larger labs processed a greater volume of requests 
than smaller labs during 2002. Although the overall median backlog at the
beginning of the year was about 390 requests, the median ranged from 70
requests among the smallest labs to nearly 5,200 requests among the largest.

Likewise, the median number of new requests ranged from about 1,700 among 
the smallest labs to over 35,000 among the largest; median completed 
requests ranged from about 1,600 to over 37,000; and median yearend 
backlog ranged from about 70 to nearly 3,700 requests.  

Labs serving county jurisdictions had the lowest median backlog at the
beginning of the year, about 360 requests. These labs received a median 
5,300 requests during 2002, completed about 4,900 requests, and finished 
the year with a backlog of about 690 requests.

Municipal labs had a median backlog of about 390 requests at the
beginning of the year. These labs received a median 5,400 requests
during 2002 and completed about 5,000. Municipal labs had the lowest
median yearend backlog -- about 400 requests.

State or regional labs had a median backlog of about 400 requests at
the beginning of the year. These labs received a median 4,400
requests during 2002, completed about 4,200, and finished the year
with a backlog of about 650 requests.

Labs serving Federal or national jurisdictions had the highest median
backlog at the beginning of the year, about 430 requests. These labs
received a median 5,500 requests, completed about 4,900 requests,
and finished the year with the highest median backlog -- about 860
requests.  

Standard protocols

Standard protocols are an important consideration in explaining resource 
needs because the complexity of a protocol will affect the speed with 
which exams can be completed and the volume of requests that can be 
processed on an annual basis. A protocol that requires an analyst to 
follow prescribed steps, while enhancing completeness and reliability, 
may slow the speed with which samples are processed.

Fingerprint examination

Fingerprint examination is one of the oldest specialty areas within the
forensic sciences, and one that has resisted firm standards for how to
examine a print and the criteria to be used in making an identification.
Fingerprint examination is also an area in which the experience of the
examiner and individual judgment are considered paramount.

Ninety-seven percent of labs conducting fingerprint examination reported 
they have a standard protocol for fingerprint examination. Of these labs, 
more than 90% report they process them (that is, chemically or via laser
examination), compare them with known prints, and use an AFIS (Automated
Fingerprint Identification System)to search a database. AFIS enables
investigators to consult large local, State, and national databases to
determine the identity of prints of unknown origin found at crime scenes.
Two-thirds of laboratories reported they regularly enhance latent prints 
using computer techniques. A third of labs report they routinely limit 
the number of items examined; crime scenes may yield many latent prints 
and the majority of labs report they examine all that are recovered.

Controlled substances 

Almost all laboratories (98%) that examine controlled substances have
standard protocols. This is to be expected because the field as a whole 
has agreed to the minimum wet chemical and instrumental means needed to
identify a particular controlled substance.  

Most labs (71%) attempt to limit the drugs they seek to identify. This 
is not unexpected given the large drug-related caseloads, and many labs
examine only a representative sample of the total drug seizure and/or
conclude their testing once they identify a controlled substance that
supports the state's prosecution.

Drug seizures are commonly composed of "cutting agents" that dilute
the purity of the sample and may also be used to determine the point
or manufacturer of origin. Unlike other forms of evidence, however,
examiners do not usually attempt to determine a drug's manufacturer
or point of origin.  About a quarter of the labs report they identify
adulterants and/or diluents in the samples and issue preliminary
findings based on these analyses.

More laboratories are experimenting with managerial and technical steps 
to reduce their caseloads and the time for analyses and giving
testimony in court.  Whereas labs once proceeded with a complete
analysis when a suspected controlled substance was submitted --
regardless of input from any other criminal justice agency -- more
laboratories today are requiring proof from the police and/or prosecutor
that the case will proceed (that is, be prosecuted) before continuing
with a complete analysis.

DNA testing

Almost all laboratories (98%) that perform DNA analysis follow a standard
protocol for DNA testing.  DNA testing has been the subject of great
scientific and legal scrutiny, and, as a result, forensic DNA analysts 
have adopted protocols acceptable to both legal and scientific communities. 

In addition to requiring an accepted laboratory protocol, specific steps
included limiting the number of items examined (70%), by asking
investigators/prosecutors to be explicit in what questions they expect
the DNA tests to answer, and handling the samples via batch processing 
(66%). Both steps enable laboratories to focus on particular stains and 
save the laboratory time and expense.  

Forty-one percent of the laboratories indicated they use technicians in
DNA testing, a step that calls for personnel with less training and
experience to examine garments and to select stains that will likely
yield scientific results that may help to resolve a critical question in 
the case.

Performance expectations

Performance expectations of examiners vary depending on the complexity of
examinations in different evidence areas. Analysts are expected to perform
large numbers of controlled substance and toxicology examinations annually,
given that the purpose of the exam is to identify the substance in question.
For most other examination areas, examiners compare evidence of unknown 
origin with standards of known origin, to determine whether the evidence 
and standard originated from the same source. These latter types of
examinations typically require a longer period for analysis.

Crime laboratory directors in 2002 expected their controlled substances
analysts to process nearly 900 requests per FTE examiner.  Likewise, the
median expectation for toxicology analysts was nearly 500 requests per FTE
examiner. The next highest category was latent prints, where the median
expectation was 264 requests per FTE examiner.  

Expected performance was much lower in all other categories, where
examiners typically attempt not only to identify the evidence, but to
associate that evidence with a suspect, weapon, or some other
instrument of the crime.  Expectations for computer investigations and
DNA analysis -- 2 areas where procedures may be very time consuming and
interpretations complex -- were the lowest of the 10 categories.

Overall, examiners in the Nation's crime laboratories processed requests at 
or above 90% of the expected averages in 8 of the 10 listed categories, and
exceeded expected performance in two of these areas -- latent prints and
toxicology. Analysts processed requests in the remaining two categories,
firearms/toolmarks and computer crimes, at about 80% of the expected average. 

Human resource needs

Overall, publicly funded laboratories estimated that an additional 1,917
FTEs would be needed in order to achieve a 30-day turnaround on all
requests for forensic services received in 2002. The estimated total
cost of the additional FTEs exceeds $70.2 million, with a median per
lab cost of $161,000.

Over half (54%) of the needed FTEs were in three areas: DNA analysis (19%);
controlled substances (19%); and latent prints (16%).  

DNA analysis

Labs performing DNA analysis estimated that about 370 additional FTEs would
have been needed to achieve a 30-day turnaround on all DNA analysis requests
received during 2002, given current laboratory conditions and analysis tools.
These additional FTEs represent a 79% increase in FTEs currently performing
DNA analysis. The estimated cost of these additional FTEs exceeds $14.4
million, with a median per lab cost of $82,100.

Controlled substances

Labs performing analysis of controlled substances estimated that 355
additional FTEs would have been needed to achieve a 30-day turnaround on 
all such requests received during 2002. These additional FTEs represent a 
16% increase in FTEs currently performing controlled substance analysis. 
The estimated cost of additional FTEs needed for analysis of controlled
substances exceeds $11.2 million, with a median per lab cost of $50,300.

Latent prints

Labs performing latent print analysis estimated that about 300 additional 
FTEs would have been needed to achieve a 30-day turnaround on all such
requests received during 2002. These additional FTEs represent a 51% 
increase in FTEs that were currently performing latent print services. The
estimated cost of these additional FTEs exceeds $10.4 million, with a 
median cost of $69,400 per lab.

Outsourcing laboratory services

Crime laboratories address the pro- blem of rising caseloads by
outsourcing various types of analyses. DNA analysis is an area where
demand has increased in recent years as laboratories try to keep up
with expanding casework as well as examining samples to enter into
convicted offender computerized databases that belong to the
Combined DNA Index System (CODIS).

DNA analysis is one area in which many private laboratories are
equipped to perform forensic casework. Fewer private laboratories
engage in more traditional forensic work such as firearms and trace
analysis. Publicly funded labs have elected to divert cases to such
facilities to partially relieve caseload pressure. Once private labs
satisfy accreditation standards set by the field, public crime labs will
use them to handle routine cases.

Forty-one percent of publicly funded laboratories reported outsourcing
one or more types of forensic services in 2002. Outsourcing was more
common among larger labs, with 71% of the largest labs -- those
having 100 or more FTEs -- reporting some type of outsourcing. About
a quarter of the smallest labs reported some type of outsourcing.

Nearly two-thirds of labs serving municipal jurisdictions reported
outsourcing some requests for forensic services in 2002. Forty-two
percent outsourced DNA casework, and 26% outsourced toxiciology
requests. 

Fifty-seven percent of labs serving county jurisdictions outsourced
requests in 2002. Thirty-two percent outsourced toxicology requests,
and 28% outsourced DNA casework.

About a third of labs serving State or regional jurisdictions outsourced
requests in 2002. Thirteen percent outsourced CODIS samples, and 12%
outsourced DNA casework.

Eleven percent of labs serving Federal or national jurisdictions
reported outsourcing requests in 2002. These requests were in the
area of digital evidence (computer crimes) and other unspecified
areas.

Overall, labs outsourced nearly 240,000 requests for forensic services
in 2002. The majority of these requests (91%) were DNA-related. These 
included nearly 13,000 casework requests and 205,000 CODIS samples. 

Labs outsourcing DNA-related requests spent nearly $4.4 million on
casework requests and $5.9 on CODIS samples. The median cost per
out-sourced request was nearly $1,200 for casework, and just $30 for
CODIS samples.   

In addition to DNA-related requests, about 14,300 toxicology and
6,000 controlled substances requests were outsourced in 2002. Labs
outsourcing in these areas spent $990,000 on toxicology requests and
$450,000 on controlled substances requests. The median cost per
outsourced toxicology request was $138. For controlled substances,
the median cost was $88 per outsourced request.

Quality, training, and research

Accreditation

Seventy-one percent of publicly funded laboratories in 2002 were
accredited by some type of professional organization.  Larger labs
were more likely to be accredited, including more than 80% of labs
having 25 or more FTEs and more than 70% of labs having 10 to 24
FTEs. About half (51%) of  the smallest labs were accredited.  
Labs serving a State or regional jurisdiction were most likely to be
accredited (79%), and labs serving a munici- pal jurisdiction, the least
(47%).

Sixty-one percent of labs were accredited by the American Society of
Crime Laboratory Directors Lab Accreditation Board (ASCLD-LAB).
This includes more than 70% of labs having 25 or more FTE employees, and 
about 60% of those having 10 to 24 FTEs. Less than half of the smallest 
labs were accredited by ASCLD-LAB.  

Labs having a State or regional jurisdiction were the most likely to be
ASCLD-LAB accredited (71%), and labs with municipal jurisdictions were 
least likely (37%). 

Proficiency testing

Ninety-seven percent of publicly funded laboratories in 2002 were engaged 
in proficiency testing, a procedure that has become an essential quality
assurance practice over the past 30 years. Proficiency testing was slightly
less common among smaller labs (those having fewer than 10 FTEs) and among
labs serving municipal jurisdictions, although a strong majority of labs in
both categories did engage in such testing.

Among the labs engaged in proficiency testing, almost all (97%) use
declared tests, a type of test in which the examiner knows he/she is
being tested.  

Another testing process that has gained favor over the past several
years is random case reanalysis, where examiners' completed prior
casework is randomly selected for reanalysis by a supervisor or
another examiner. A little over half (54%) of laboratories engaged in
proficiency testing use this type of test. Twenty-six percent of the labs
engaged in proficiency testing use blind tests, a type of test in which
the examiner doesn't know the sample being analyzed is a test
sample.  

Almost all (98%) of laboratories engaged in proficiency testing used
tests that were generated externally (not shown in a table). External
tests allow the laboratory to compare its results against other
laboratories engaged in similar testing.  

In addition to external tests, 74% of laboratories engaged in proficiency
testing used internally generated tests. For example, a laboratory director 
or supervisor or a quality control unit may create test samples. Externally
generated proficiency tests are generally deemed a more objective measure 
of a laboratory's performance. 

-----------------------------------------------------
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Laboratory

The FBI Laboratory Division is the largest publicly funded forensic
crime laboratory in the United States, with 585 FTE employees as of
January 2004. The FBI lab is more than twice as large as the next
largest publicly funded crime lab.

The FBI lab provides a full range of forensic services, including all
of those catalogued by the BJS census of forensic crime labs.

The FBI's fiscal budget for laboratory operations is about $172.2
million, nearly 8 times greater than the operating budget of the next
largest publicly funded crime lab. The total budget includes about
$31.5 million (or 18% of the total) for research and development.
The FBI lab began 2003 with an estimated backlog of 3,062 requests
for forensic services. About two-thirds of the backlog was attributable
to latent prints requests.

During 2003, the FBI lab received 6,994 new requests and completed
7,403 requests. The estimated yearend backlog was 2,653 requests, a
13% reduction in total backlog from the beginning of the year. Latent
print requests comprised half of the yearend 2003 backlog.

By the end of the first quarter of 2004, the FBI lab reported a total
backlog of 2,585 requests. This included 1,216 latent print requests, 
or 47% of the total.

The FBI laboratory reported a need for additional equipment and 249
additional FTEs in order to have achieved a 30-day turnaround on all
2003 requests. The cost of the additional equipment was estimated to
be $40 million.  Based on starting salaries for analyst/examiners, 
the estimated cost of the additional FTE's exceeds $17.5 million.
--------------------------------------------------------

Training and research  

About half (52%) of publicly funded laboratories in 2002 dedicated
resources to training, defined as ‘a structured interaction process with
the function of teaching the history, theories, and/or the application of
those scientific techniques and methods that are utilized within the
crime laboratory.' 

Nearly 80% of labs having 50 to 99 FTEs and nearly 60% of those having 100 
or more FTEs reported having resources dedicated to training.  Slightly 
less than half of labs having 10 to 49 FTEs dedicated resources to 
training.

By type of jurisdiction served, 74% of labs having federal or national
jurisdictions and 63% of labs having municipal jurisdictions reported
having resources dedicated to training. Less than half of labs serving
State or regional jurisdictions had resources dedicated to training.

Twelve percent of laboratories dedicate resources to research, defined
as ‘experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts,
the revision of accepted theories, or practical application of such new
or revised theories or technologies.' 

Larger labs were more likely to have resources dedicated to research.
Thirty-two percent of labs having 50 to 99 FTEs and 21% of those with
100 or more FTEs had resources dedicated to research. Less than
10% of labs having fewer than 25 FTEs had resources dedicated to
research.

More than half (53%) of labs serving Federal or national jurisdictions
had resources dedicated to research, while about 10% of labs serving
other types of jurisdictions had such resources.      

Budget and pay

Operating budgets

Obtaining information on budgets is difficult because some laboratories 
are units of larger scientific and/or law enforcement systems that do 
not have accurate figures on an individual lab's expenditures. For 
example, personnel expenditures, facility leases, and equipment contracts
might be covered by a centralized unit. Because of these difficulties,
budget figures should be considered with care.

Publicly funded crime labs in 2002 had estimated total annual budgets
exceeding $750 million. The median annual budget per laboratory was
$1.3 million, ranging from  $359,000 among the smallest labs to $8.7
million among the largest.  

On a per employee basis, the median operating budget was $125,600 per
analyst/examiner and $74,200 per FTE employee. Medium-sized labs -- those
having 25 to 49 FTEs -- had the highest median operating budgets on a per
employee basis -- $155,500 per analyst/examiner and $89,800 per FTE.

Laboratories serving State or regional jurisdictions accounted for about
$400 million, or 53% of the total.  County labs accounted for $155
million (21%) and municipal labs, $100 million (13%). Labs serving
Federal or national jurisdictions accounted for $96 million, or about
13% of the total.  

On a per laboratory basis, those serving Federal or national jurisdictions 
had the highest median budgets at nearly $2.6 million. Median budgets in 
labs serving other types of jurisdictions ranged from $1.2 million (State 
or regional) to $1.6 million (municipal).  

Labs serving Federal or national jurisdictions had the highest median
operating budgets on a per employee basis -- $163,500 per analyst/examiner 
and $105,000 per FTE. Labs serving State or regional jurisdictions had the
lowest -- $120,200 per analyst/examiner and $74,200 per FTE. 

Budget categories

The largest operating budget category was personnel, typically accounting 
for nearly 80% of labs' total operating budgets. About 15% of laboratory
budgets were typically devoted to supplies (7%), equipment (5%), and 
services (3%). Facilities and travel each accounted for about 1% of labs'
operating budgets.

While most laboratories are engaged in quality assurance programs like
proficiency testing, accreditation, and methods validation, only a
small proportion of laboratory operating budgets (typically less than
1%) is devoted to training or quality assurance. 

Funding sources

Excluding labs having Federal or national jurisdictions, for which all
funding was derived from Federal sources, 67% of labs reported
receiving at least some funding from State sources. Forty-one percent
of laboratories reported receiving at least some funding from local
sources.

Twenty-one percent of laboratories reported receiving at least some
funding from Federal sources. Federal funding was more likely among
larger labs, including 36% of those having 100 or more FTEs. In
contrast, about 18% of labs having less than 25 FTEs reported
receiving Federal funding. 

Over half (55%) of labs reported receiving at least some funding from
grants. Grant funding was more likely among larger labs, including
82% of those having 100 or more FTEs. Forty percent of the smallest
labs received grant funding.

About 3 in 10 labs reported receiving fees for services.  

Labs receiving State funding included 96% of those serving State or
regional jurisdictions, 28% of county labs, and 14% of municipal labs. 
Recipients of local governmental funding included 97% of labs serving
municipal jurisdictions, 91% of county labs, and 9% of State or
regional labs.  Federal funding was reported by 29% of labs serving
State or regional jurisdictions, 9% of municipal labs, and 7% of county
labs.

Labs receiving grant funding included 61% of those serving county
jurisdictions, and 53% of those serving municipal, State or regional
jurisdictions.  About 3 in 10 county, State, and regional labs received
fees for services. Sixteen percent of municipal labs received such
fees.

Among labs serving municipal jurisdictions, the greatest share of
laboratory budgets was funding from local governments. Local funding
comprised 86% of municipal laboratory budgets on average. Three
percent was from State governments, and less than half of 1% was
from the Federal Government.

Similarly, funding from local governments comprised 75% of county
laboratory budgets on average. Eight percent was from State
governments, and less than half of 1% was from the Federal
Government.

Labs serving State or regional jurisdictions received 5% of their total
budgets from local governments, on average. The greatest share of
State or regional laboratory budgets came from State governments,
about 80% on average.  Three percent was from Federal Government.

Grants and fees contribute significantly to laboratory operating
budgets. On average, the percentage of total budgets attributable to
grant funds is 10% among labs serving county jurisdictions, 8% among
municipal labs, and 5% among State or regional laboratories.  

The average percentage of total budgets attributable to fees is 7%
among labs serving State or regional jurisdictions, 4% among county
labs, and half of 1% among municipal laboratories.

Salaries

Overall, median salaries for laboratory directors ranged from $65,000
to $89,200 annually; for mid-level supervisors, the range was $49,800
to $75,600; for analyst/examiners, $35,400 to $63,000; and for
technicians, $26,400 to $40,200.

In general, salary ranges were higher among larger labs, and lower
among smaller labs. For example, median salaries for laboratory
directors ranged from $78,800 to $110,900 among labs with 100 or
more FTEs, and from $55,700 to $79,700 among labs with fewer than
10 FTEs.  

Median salaries for supervisors ranged from $61,000 to $80,800 among labs 
with 100 or more FTEs, and from $47,100 to $65,000 among labs with fewer 
than 10 FTEs. Analyst or examiner salaries ranged from $36,200 to $77,000
among the largest labs, and from $34,100 to $57,500 among the smallest.
Salaries for technical support personnel ranged from $29,000 to $42,800 
among the largest labs and from $25,900 to $35,000 among the smallest.

Median salary ranges were also generally higher among labs serving
Federal or national jurisdictions, and lower among those serving State
or regional jurisdictions. For example, median salaries ranged from
$96,000 to $124,800 for directors of Federal or national labs, and from
$59,000 to $83,800 for directors of State or regional labs.

Salary ranges for supervisors ranged from $80,000 to $109,300 among Federal
 or national labs, and from $47,800 to $74,500 among State or regional labs.
Analyst or examiner salaries ranged from $35,100 to $93,000 among Federal or
national labs and from $33,200 to $59,800 among State or regional labs.
Salaries for technical support personnel ranged from $27,500 to $52,800 
among federal or national labs and from $25,000 to $39,600 among State or
regional labs.

Methodology

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) awarded grant no. 2002-BJ-CX-K011 to
the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) to undertake the 2002 Census of
Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories. UIC partnered with the American
Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) and the UIC Survey Research
Laboratory (SRL) to administer the census.

The survey instrument was designed by project staff with input from BJS 
staff and the ASCLD advisory committee. The survey was pre-tested with 10
laboratories representing different sized facilities (by number of FTE
scientists) and governmental affiliations (Federal, State, and local).

ASCLD provided UIC with a mailing list of 469 facilities that
self-identified as crime laboratories, and which ASCLD used for
membership purposes. Advance letters were mailed to all laboratories
followed by telephone screening. A total of 39 laboratories were
removed from the list because callers either determined the facility
was not a crime laboratory, was a duplicate listing, or contained faulty
contact information.

Following the initial mailing of 430 surveys and a second round, 218
facilities completed the survey. Twelve labs were determined to be
ineligible. This resulted in an initial response rate of 52% (218/418).

Following extensive follow-up efforts, it was discovered that the list
contained many facilities that did not meet the project definition of a
crime laboratory:

A laboratory which employs one or more full time scientists whose
principal function is the examination of physical evidence for law
enforcement agencies and that provides reports and testimony to
courts of law with respect to such evidence.

A number of police agency units on the list investigated crime scenes,
searched for and gathered evidence, and took photographs, but did
not employ full-time scientists to examine the evidence collected. The
list contained names and addresses of police "identification units" that
typically investigated crime scenes for fingerprints, and processed and
examined those fingerprints, but were not laboratories and did not
employ at least one scientist who examined and interpreted the
physical evidence.

The population subsequently dropped to 351 eligible laboratories.
Completed surveys were obtained from 281 laboratories, for a
response rate of 80%. In a final effort to improve response, UIC and
BJS developed a reduced length survey instrument that collected
basic information about laboratory operations. In conjunction with
additional telephone calls and e-mails, another 25 laboratories
responded to the shorter survey, for an overall response rate of 87%
(306/351). 

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) laboratory division provided
data for 2003. This report presents the FBI data separately.

Among the 45 non-responding laboratories are 27 State or regional labs, 
5 county labs, 5 municipal labs, and 8 Federal labs. This results in 
response rates of 87%, 92%, 90%, and 76%, respectively.

Among responding laboratories, missing data imputations were made for
personnel, budgets, and evidence processing data.

Missing actual FTE data were imputed by multiplying authorized FTE
by the mean percentage of authorized FTEs actually employed among
labs of similar type and size. Total FTEs in specific categories of
employment were imputed by multiplying total actual FTE by the
median percentage of total FTEs employed in specific categories for
labs of similar type and size.

Missing annual budget data were imputed as follows: for labs reporting
a combined budget figure as part of a laboratory system, the combined
budget was split proportionately, based on a given labs' share of total
FTE for the laboratory system. For other labs, total FTE was multiplied
by the median ratio of expenditures per FTE for similar labs by size
and type. If the lab was part of a State system in which other labs
reported individual budgets, the median ratio method was used within
that system. Among labs serving Federal jurisdictions, the median
ratio method was used for labs within the same service. Missing case
processing data (cases received and backlogged) were imputed by 
multiplying total FTE by the median ratio of cases per FTE for similar
labs by size and type.  

Labs which did not provide complete request processing data (initial
backlog, new requests, and completions) received imputed values
within each category of forensic service they perform based on median
requests per FTE for similar labs by size. Total FTE was multiplied by
the median ratio for labs of similar size for each type of request.
