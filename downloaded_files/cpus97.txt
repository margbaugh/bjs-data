Highlights

An estimated 5.7 million adult residents of the United States 
were under some form of correctional supervision in 1997.  
Seven in 10 were supervised in the community, through probation 
or parole.  

About 2.8% of all adult residents of the United States were 
under correctional supervision in 1997, up from 1.7% in 1985.  
About 9.0% of black adults, 2.0% of white adults, and 1.3% of 
adults of other races were under correctional supervision in 
1997.

Jails 

On June 30,1997, local jails held an estimated 557,974 adults.  
Men comprised 89% of adult jail inmates.  White non- Hispanic 
inmates accounted for 41% of the total jail population; 
black non- Hispanics, 42%; and Hispanics, 16%.

The total number of adults in local jails increased by 
approximately 47,600 during the year ending June 30, 1997, 
or 9.3%.   The growth rate during 1997 was nearly twice 
that of the average annual increase between 1990 and 1997.

Probation 

Nearly 3.3 million adults were on probation on December 
31,1997.  Probationers made up 57% of all adults under 
correctional supervision in 1997.

Twenty-one percent of the probationers were women, a larger 
proportion than for any other correctional population.  
About 64% were white and 34% black. 

Between yearend 1996 and 1997, the number of adults on 
probation increased by 101,841 (3.2%).  From 1990 to 1997 
the probation population grew by nearly 600,000 people, an 
average of 2.9% annually.

About 62% of all adults discharged from probation in 1997 
had successfully completed their sentences.  Nearly 20% 
were incarcerated, 5% under a new sentence and 14% with 
the same sentence.

Prisons

Nearly 1.2 million men and women were in the custody of 
State and Federal prisons at yearend 1997.  Approximately 
94% were men.  About 48% of the inmates were white, 49% black, 
and 3% American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, or Pacific Islander. 

The number of inmates in State and Federal custody rose by 
49,158 (4.4%) during 1997. Between 1990 and 1997 the prison 
population increased by nearly 434,000 inmates, or an average 
annual growth of 6.8%.

The number of sentenced prisoners under State or Federal 
jurisdiction per 100,000 U.S. residents increased from 297 
in 1990 to 444 in 1997.  Between 1990 and 1997 the imprisonment 
rate of white inmates rose 36% from 139 to 189 per 100,000; 
the rate for blacks increased 63% from 1,067 to 1,743; and 
the rate for Hispanics grew  35% from 548 to 738.

Among whites, prisoners age 30-34 had the highest incarceration 
rate in 1997:  476 per 100,000 white residents.  Among blacks, 
prisoners age 25-29 had the highest rate: 4,564 per 100,000.  

Approximately 62% of sentenced inmates entering prison in 1997 
were new court commitments.  Just over a third were parole or 
other conditional release violators, up from 29% in 1990.

Around 334,500 sentenced offenders were admitted as new 
court commitments to State prisons during 1997.  Between 
1990 and 1997, the number of persons entering State prison 
for a violent offense increased by 16% from 86,600 in 1990 
to 100,200 in 1997.  Admissions for  public-order offenses 
were up by 37%, from 26,000 in 1990 to 35,700 in 1997.  
Property offenses decreased by 9%, from 104,400 in 1990 to 
94,700 in 1997.  

For the fourth consecutive year, the largest number of 
admissions to State prison were for drug offenses, 102,600 
drug offenders were admitted in 1997, up from 102,400 in 
1990.

There were 39,431 sentenced offenders admitted to Federal 
prison in 1997.  Forty-six percent were drug offenders, 27% 
were public-order offenders, 20% property offenders, and 7% 
violent offenders.

Parole and post-release supervision

An estimated 690,750 adults were on parole at yearend 
1997, a 1.6% increase from 1996.  The average annual rate 
of growth between 1990 to 1997 was 3.8%. Among persons 
released from prison in 1997, around 83% were placed 
on probation, parole, or some other type of conditional 
release.

The number of persons leaving State prisons based on parole 
board decisions declined from 39% in 1990 to 28% in 1997.  
During the same period, the number exiting by mandatory release 
grew from 29% to 40% of all releases, and the number  whose 
sentence expired increased from 13% to 17%.

Slightly fewer than 9 in 10 parolees were male.  An estimated 
54% of persons on parole were white; 44%, black; and 2%, other 
races.

Around 6% of the parole population was under intensive supervision.  
Nearly half (45%) of all exits from parole were successful 
completions, 41% were returned to incarceration.  One in every 
8 parolees were returned to prison with a new sentence.

The proportion of  adults being actively supervised (80%), 
those being supervised out of State (5%), and the number of
absconders (7%) remained relatively unchanged between 1996 and 
1997.  The number of parolees classified under inactive 
supervision (7%) decreased slightly.

Capital punishment

During 1997, 256 inmates were received under sentence of 
death by State and Federal prisons.  As of December 31, 1997, 
the Nation's prisons held a total of 3,335 inmates under 
sentence of death.  An estimated 56% were white and 42% were 
black.  Half had been under sentence of death for at least 
6 years and 7 months. 

Seventeen States executed 74 male prisoners during 1996, 
including 45 whites, 27 blacks, 1 American Indian, and 1 
Asian person.  Between 1977 and 1997 a total of 432 prisoners 
were executed under civil authority in the United States. 

Military confinement 

On December 31, 1997, the Air Force, Army, Marine Corps, and 
Navy held a total of 2,772 prisoners in 64 facilities.  The 
Coast Guard operated no confinement facilities.  

Probation

Persons serving a sentence to probation usually--
*  received the sentence from a court as an alternative 
to confinement
*  live unconfined in the community while meeting certain 
conditions
*  must fulfill conditional requirements like keeping a job, 
not drinking, not using drugs, not keeping company with known 
offenders, paying restitution or fine, and regularly reporting 
to a probation officer.  

Jail 

Persons in jail usually
*  are confined in a facility owned by a county or city 
*  are in facility that holds people for 72 hours or more, 
as opposed to a temporary lockup
*  if they are sentenced, are serving a sentence of a year or 
less or are waiting for transfer to prison or for disposition 
of charges of violation of a conditional release
*  if they are unsentenced, are waiting for a trial or hearing 
or for transfer to juvenile, court, or mental health authorities.

Prison

Persons in prison usually--
*   are confined in a facility owned by a State 
or by the Federal Government
*  are serving a sentence of more than a year 
(except in six States combining jails and prisons 
-- Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, 
Rhode Island, and Vermont). 

Parole

Persons on parole or post-release supervision usually-- 
*  received the parole from an executive authority or 
received a sentence to post-release supervision from a 
judicial authority, after a time in prison or jail 
*  live unconfined in the community while meeting certain 
conditions
*   must fulfill conditional requirements like keeping a 
job, not drinking, not using drugs, not keeping company 
with known offenders, and regularly reporting to a parole 
officer.

Approximately 98% of the prisoners held  by the Army, 87% 
of those held by the Air Force, 79% of those held by the Navy, 
and 75% of those held by the Marine Corps at yearend 1997 were 
convicted inmates; the remainder were unconvicted persons whose 
cases had not yet been tried.   

Half of convicted military prisoners had committed a violent 
offense.  About a third were confined for rape (16%) or sexual 
assault (15%).  A fifth were serving sentences for drugs.  
Eleven percent were sentenced for larceny/theft, and 11% for 
murder.  Approximately 8% were confined for military infractions, 
such as AWOL, insubordination, or failure to obey a lawful order.

Ninety-eight percent of all prisoners held in military confinement 
facilities in 1997 were men, and 2% were women.  About 52% were 
non-Hispanic whites; 35%, non- Hispanic blacks; 9%, Hispanics; 
and 4%, other races.  Around 98% were enlisted personnel, and 
2% officers.

1997 Survey of Inmates in State and 
Federal Correctional Facilities

The 1997 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional 
Facilities conducted face-to-face interviews with prison 
inmates from June through October 1997. 

The Surveys obtained detailed information about State and 
Federal prison inmates' current offenses and sentences, their 
criminal histories, personal and family characteristics, drug 
and alcohol use, treatment,  health care, and prison conditions.  
State prison inmate surveys were also conducted in 1974, 1979, 
1986, and 1991.  Federal inmates were surveyed for the first 
time in 1991.

During the period that interviews were conducted, 1,409 State 
prisons held 1,059,607 inmates, and 127 Federal prisons held 
89,072 inmates.  Since 1991, when the previous survey was conducted, 
the State and Federal prison population grew by 51%.

The percentage of white, black, and Hispanic State prison inmates 
remained relatively unchanged between 1991 and 1997.  Thirty-three 
percent of State inmates were white non-Hispanic, 47% black non-
Hispanic, and 17% Hispanic.  The percentage of black inmates 
in Federal prison increased from 30% in 1991 to 38% in 1997.  

The State prison population grew increasingly middle-aged 
between 1991 and 1997. In 1991 inmates between age 35 to 44 
comprised 23% of the population, the same group accounted for 
29% in 1997.  Overall, the median age increased from 30 years 
in 1991 to 32 years in 1997.  The median age of Federal prisoners 
remained unchanged at 36 years.

Just under half of inmates in State prison were incarcerated for 
a violent offense in both 1991 and 1997.  The percentage of property 
offenders dropped from 25% in 1991 to 22% in 1997, while public-
order offenses increased from 7% to 10% during the same period.  
In both years about 2 in 10 State inmates were incarcerated for 
a drug offense.  

The percentage of inmates held for a drug offense in Federal prison 
continued to rise, from 58% in 1991 to 63% in 1997.  Nearly half were 
drug trafficking offenders.

Just under half of all inmates in State prison and a quarter of 
those in Federal prison were on probation or parole at the time of 
their current arrest.  The percentage of recidivists among State 
prisoners, those with a prior sentence to probation or incarceration, 
declined from 81% in 1991 to 76% in 1997.  Nearly 43% of State 
inmates said they had served three or more prior sentences.

At the time of the offense, just over half of State inmates in 1997, 
and a third of Federal inmates were under the influence of either 
alcohol or drugs.  Among State inmates, 37% were under the influence 
of alcohol, and 33% were under the influence of drugs.  Among 
Federal inmates, 20% were drinking and 22% were using drugs.

Reported drug use by State and Federal prison inmates increased 
between 1991 and 1997.  Nearly 57% of State inmates were using 
drugs in the month before the offense, up from 50% in 1991.  
Drug use among Federal inmates increased from 32% in 1991 to 
45% in 1997.

Overall, the percentage of inmates who reported receiving drug 
treatment and programs since admission to State prison declined 
from 30% in 1991 to 24% in 1997.  Among federal prisoners, 25% 
reported participation in drug treatment or programs in 1997, 
up from 20% in 1991.

Among those who used drugs regularly in the month before the 
offense, 35% of State prisoners and 40% of Federal inmates in 
1997 had participated in a drug treatment or drug abuse program 
since admission.

Prior to admission to prison, 57% of female State prison inmates 
and 16% of males said they had been physically or sexually abused.  
Lower rates of abuse were reported by Federal inmates, 7% 
of males and 40% of females reported prior abuse.

Imortant Note

Correctional Populations in the United States presents numbers 
that describe persons under some form of correctional supervision.  
In this compilation the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) seeks 
to help users by--

*  making readily apparent the links between different correctional 
institutions or methods in each State 
*  suggesting the similarities and differences between States 
and regions as our system of criminal justice responds to both 
common and disparate needs
*  permitting comparisons, however limited they must be, with 
previous years' statistics. 

Helping readers find a single number

Through an index at the end of the volume, readers can find 
all topics treated in the tables.  The index numbers refer to 
the tables.

Footnotes give extra information about how to interpret the 
numbers in the tables.

Category definitions are available in three places:  the 
explanatory notes in the appendices of sections, the questionnaires 
also in the appendices, and the definitions of common terms in the 
Introduction on page 2. 

To make comparisons across years or 
between jurisdictions 

BJS makes every effort to report numbers that are consistent 
in interpretation with those of the past and between separate 
jurisdictions in the present.  Data collection rules and 
reporting protocols that fit historical statistics 
and that impose the least burden on respondents are used.

Some jurisdictions depart from the reporting conventions, 
and some categories for counting have shifted over the years.  
Users who try to draw conclusions from such numbers by comparing 
years or jurisdictions must take into account special circumstances 
and changes.  Footnotes, table notes, explanatory notes, and other 
material highlighting the tables must be consulted for a full 
understanding of the data.

The following symbols are used in the 
tables:

  /  not reported

  :  not known

...  not applicable

Definitions of common terms 
used in tables

Custody.  To have custody of a prisoner, a State must hold that 
person in one of its facilities.  Early statistical reports gave 
custody counts that largely have been replaced by jurisdiction 
counts of State prison populations.  A State may have custody of 
a prisoner over whom another State maintains jurisdiction.  The 
tables present both kinds of counting procedures, with jurisdiction 
counts being more complete; States reporting only on custody are 
noted.

Detention status.  This term distinguishes between prisoners, 
usually in jail, who were convicted or awaiting judgment.

Discretionary parole.  A release from prison to supervision is 
discretionary when it is decided by a board or other authority.

Hispanic origin.  A person of Hispanic origin may be of any 
race; however, a few States treat the ethnic category as a 
racial one.

Jurisdiction.  Jurisdiction refers to a unit of government or 
to the legal authority to exercise governmental power.  According 
to the latter meaning, the prisoners under a State's jurisdiction 
may be in the custody of local jails.  (See "Custody.")

Mandatory parole.  Mandatory parole results from statutory or 
correctional guidelines, and no judgment by a panel or board is 
required for release of a prisoner to supervision outside prison.

Maximum sentence length.  Some jurisdictions sentence offenders 
to a range of years; the larger number in that range is the most 
that a prisoner may serve on a sentence.  Often, good time is 
subtracted from the maximum sentence.  When the tables report on 
prisoners with sentences longer or shorter than a year, the 
maximum sentence is used where applicable. 

Military justice terms   General court-martial is the highest 
military court for judging the most serious offenses.  A military 
judge presides.  This court  includes members (jurors) at the 
election of the accused, except when the court must have members 
for imposition of the death penalty.  If an enlisted person is 
accused, in the absence of exigent circumstances at least a third 
of the court must be enlisted members who are not lower ranking 
than the accused.  A general court-martial may be used to try any 
person subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 

Special court-martial is used for judging offenses less serious 
than those in a general court-martial.  A military judge 
presides.  A special court-martial may not impose the 
following:  the death penalty,  a dishonorable discharge, 
dismissal of an officer, confinement in excess of 6 months, 
hard labor without confinement for more than 3 months, 
forfeiture of pay in excess of two-thirds of pay per month, 
or forfeiture of any percentage of  pay for more than 6 
months.

Summary court-martial is the least formal military court, 
consisting of one active-duty commissioned officer.  This 
court promptly adjudicates minor offenses under a simple 
procedure.  Punishment may not exceed confinement for 1 month, 
hard labor without confinement for 45 days, restriction to 
specified limits for more than 2 months, or forfeiture of 
more than two-thirds pay for more than 1 month.  If the service 
member is above the rank of E-4, the presiding officer may not 
impose confinement, hard labor without confinement, or reduction 
of more than one grade.  

Movement.  In corrections, a movement is an admission to or a 
release from a status such as prisoner, parolee, or probationer.  
Unless specifically noted, a transfer between facilities does not 
count as a movement.

Most serious offense.  The offense with the longest term of 
incarceration imposed.

New court commitments.  Inmates who were admitted to prison 
directly from a court with all new sentences.  This category 
includes probation violators entering prison for the first time 
on the probated offenses.  Parole violators are excluded from 
this category.

One-day count.  For a 1-day count a jurisdiction or facility 
is asked to report how many people were on its roll on a certain 
day.  The average daily population is a year's total number of 
people on the roll each day, divided by the number of days.  The 
methods of counting in aggregate do not yield estimates of either 
the number of persons in a status during the year or the average 
amount of time persons remain in a status.

Parole.  Unless otherwise specified, parole includes all types 
of supervision in the community in which the period of community 
supervision was affixed at the time of release from a prison or jail. 
Includes discretionary parole, mandatory parole, and other forms of
post-release supervision. Excludes persons initially sentenced to
incarceration followed by a period of probation, often referred to 
as a "split sentence."

Race.  Classification by race often depends on the reporting 
program and the State.  A few States reported two categories:  
white and nonwhite.  A few others categorized Hispanic offenders 
as belonging to "Other race."  The number of persons with 
certain racial backgrounds were sometimes estimated.

Reporting time.  The prison and capital punishment figures 
are from December 31, 1996, unless otherwise noted.  The Bureau 
of the Census surveyed jails on June 30, 1996. The bureau 
conducted the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails from October 1995 
through March 1996.

Revisions.  Many States revise the yearend number reported for 
the previous year.  Those revisions are made in the total, not 
the detail.  For example, the number of blacks, whites, and 
members of other races for 1995 were not changed by a State 
in 1996 to equal its revised 1995 total.
