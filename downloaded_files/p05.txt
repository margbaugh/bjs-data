Nearly 2.2 million persons in prison 
or jail at yearend 2005
  
On December 31, 2005, a total of 1,446,269 inmates were in the 
custody of State and Federal prison authorities, and 747,529 
were in the custody of local jail authorities. (Custody is
defined on page 11.) The total incarcerated population 
increased by 58,463, or 2.7% from yearend 2004. This is less 
than the average annual increase of 3.3% since 1995.

Including inmates in public and privately operated facilities, 
the number of inmates in State prisons increased 1.3% during 
2005; the number in Federal prisons, 5.1%; and in local jails,
4.7%.

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail was 737 inmates
per 100,000 U.S. residents in 2005, up from 601 in 1995. At 
yearend 2005, 1 in every 136 U.S. residents was incarcerated 
in a State or Federal prison or a local jail.

U.S. prison population rose 1.9% 
during 2005

In 2005 the percentage increase in inmates under State or
Federal jurisdiction (1.9%) was the same as recorded in 2004. 
(Jurisdiction is defined on page 11.) The population under 
the jurisdiction of State and Federal authorities increased 
by 28,824 inmates during 2005, slightly larger than the 
increase in 2004 (up 28,499). Since December 31, 1995, the 
U.S. prison population has grown an average of 44,527 inmates 
per year (3.1%).

The Federal prison population totaled 187,618 at yearend 2005, 
up from 180,328 at yearend 2004. About 12% of all prisoners 
were serving time in the Federal system.

-------------------------------------------------------
15,735 inmates held in U.S. Territories at yearend 2005

The U.S. Territories and Commonwealths –- American Samoa, 
Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and Virgin 
Islands – reported 15,735 inmates in the custody of their 
prison systems at yearend 2005, a decrease of 22 persons 
from 2004. Puerto Rico held the largest number of sentenced 
prisoners, 11,469 at yearend 2005.

Prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year totaled 12,399 
(more than three-quarters of the total territorial prison 
population). 

Relative to the resident population in the Territories, the 
rate of incarceration was 287 prisoners per 100,000 residents. 
Of the 5 Territories, the U.S. Virgin Islands had the highest 
prison incarceration rate (400 inmates per 100,000 residents), 
followed by Guam (with 301).  
-------------------------------------------------------

14 States reported increases of at 
least 5% during 2005; 11 States had 
decreases 

Between January 1 and December 31, 2005, South Dakota
experienced the largest increase in prison population(up 11.9%), 
followed by Montana (up 10.9%), Kentucky (up 10.4%), and
Nebraska (up 7.9%). Eleven States experienced a decline. 
Georgia had the largest decline (down 4.6%), followed by 
Maryland (down 2.4%), Louisiana (down 2.3%), and Mississippi 
(down 2.2%). 

In absolute numbers four jurisdictions grew by at least 2,000
inmates during 2005, including the Federal system (up 7,290), 
Florida (up 4,235), California (up 4,120), and Alabama (up 
2,001). Georgia and New York had the largest drop in inmates 
(down 2,355 and 1,008, respectively).
 
Overall, the number of inmates under jurisdiction in the West
grew 3.2%, followed by those in the Midwest (1.6%), the 
Northeast (1.1%), and the South (1.0%). 

Prison incarceration rate reached 
491 per 100,000 residents in 2005, 
up from 411 in 1995

Eleven States exceeded the national prison incarceration rate
of 491 per 100,000 residents, led by Louisiana(797), Texas(691), 
Mississippi (660), and Oklahoma (652). Seven States, led by 
Maine(144), Minnesota(180), and Rhode Island(189), had rates 
that were less than half the national rate. 

Since 1995 the sentenced inmate population in State prisons 
has increased an average 3.0% per year. During this period, 
12 States had an average annual growth of at least 5%, led by 
North Dakota (up 9.3%), West Virginia(up 7.9%), and Oregon(up
7.5%). Between 1995 and 2005 the Federal system grew an 
average of 7.1% per year. In absolute numbers this is an 
average annual increase of 8,251 inmates.

Female prisoners increased 2.6% 
during 2005; male prisoners, 1.9% 

During 2005 the number of females under the jurisdiction of 
State or Federal prison authorities increased by 2.6%. The 
number of males in  prison rose 1.9%. At yearend 2005,
107,518 females and 1,418,406 males were in prison. Since
1995 the annual rate of growth in female prisoners averaged 
4.6%, which was higher than the 3.0% increase in male 
prisoners. By yearend 2005 females accounted for 7.0% of all 
prisoners, up from 6.1% in 1995 and 5.7% in 1990.  

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident population,
males were over 14 times more likely than females to be 
incarcerated in a State or Federal prison. At yearend 2005 
there were 65 sentenced female inmates per 100,000 females 
in the resident population, compared to 929 sentenced male 
inmates per 100,000 males.

Since 1995 the total number of male prisoners has grown 34%;
the number of female prisoners, 57%. At yearend 2005, 1 in 
every 1,538 women and 1 in every 108 men were incarcerated 
in a State or Federal prison.

Over a third of female prisoners 
held in the 3 largest jurisdictions

Texas (13,506), the Federal system (12,422), and California
(11,667) held more than a third of all female inmates at 
yearend . Oklahoma (129 sentenced female inmates per 100,000
female residents), Idaho (110), and Mississippi (107) had the
highest female incarceration rates. States with the lowest 
female incarceration rates were concentrated in the Northeast, 
led by Rhode Island (with 10 sentenced female prisoners per 
100,000 female residents), Massachusetts (12), and Maine (17).
 
Thirteen States had an average annual increase in the female
prison population of more than 10% between 1995 and 2005, 
led by North Dakota (18.2%), Idaho (14.1%), and West Virginia
(14.0%). During this period the State female prison population 
increased an average of 4.5% per year; the Federal female 
prison population increased 5.3% per year.

Privately operated prisons held 
7.0% of State and Federal inmates 
in 2005

Since yearend 2000 the number of Federal inmates held in 
private facilities increased 74.2%, while the number held 
in State facilities increased 7.2%. As a percentage of all 
inmates under State and Federal jurisdiction, the number held 
in private facilities has increased slightly to 7.0% in 2005. 

At yearend 2005, 33 States and the Federal system reported a
total of 107,447 prisoners held in privately operated prison 
facilities. Private facilities held 6.0% of all State 
prisoners and 14.4% of Federal prisoners. Among States, Texas 
(with 17,517 State inmates housed in private facilities) and 
Florida (with 6,261) reported the largest populations in 2005. 

Five States had at least 25% of their prison population housed 
in private prisons, led by New Mexico(43%), Wyoming(41%), 
Hawaii (31%), Alaska (28%), and Montana (26%). 

At yearend 2005, 8.5% of State inmates in the South and 7.2%
in the West were in privately operated facilities. The 
Northeast (2.1%) and Midwest (1.2%)had the lowest percentage 
of State inmates in private facilities.

In 2005 local jails held almost 
5% of State and Federal prisoners 

At the end of 2005, 35 States and the Federal system reported
a total of 73,097 State and Federal prisoners held in local 
jails or other facilities operated by county or local 
authorities.  These inmates held in local jails represented 
4.8% of all prisoners in 2005.  

Louisiana had the largest percentage of its State inmate
population housed in local jails(45%). Four other states had 
at least a fifth of their population housed in local jails: 
Kentucky (29%), Tennessee (27%), West Virginia (24%), and 
Mississippi (22%).

Among State prisoners in the South, 10.0% were held in local
jails. In the West, 2.1% of State prisoners were in local 
jails, and in the Midwest and Northeast both had 1.2% of 
their State prisoners in local jails. 

From yearend 2000 to 2005 the number of Federal inmates held
in local jails decreased by more than half, while the number 
of State inmates in local jails rose about 19%.

23 States and the Federal system 
operated at or above highest
capacity

To estimate the capacity of their prisons, jurisdictions were
asked to supply three measures for capacity at yearend 2005: 
rated, operational, and design capacities. These measures 
were defined as follows: 

Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by 
a rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction.

Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated, based on a facility's staff, existing programs, 
and services.

Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility.

Twenty-three jurisdictions gave only 1 measure or the same
figure for each measure. For the 27 jurisdictions with more 
than 1 reported type of capacity, estimates of population 
as a percent of capacity are based on the highest and lowest
figures provided.

At yearend 2005, 26 States reported that they were operating
below 100% of their highest capacity, and 23 States and the 
Federal prison system reported operating at 100% or more of 
their highest capacity. Nevada, operating at 56% of its 
highest capacity, reported the lowest percent of capacity 
occupied. Alabama and California, both 93% over their lowest 
reported capacity, had the highest percent of capacity 
occupied. 

At yearend 2005 the Federal prison system was operating at
34% over capacity. Overall, State prisons were operating 
between 99% of their highest capacity and 114% of their 
lowest capacity.

60% of State and Federal inmates 
black or Hispanic at yearend 2005

At yearend 2005 black inmates represented an estimated 40% 
of all inmates with a sentence of more than 1 year, while 
white inmates accounted for 35% and Hispanic inmates, 20%.

Although the total number of sentenced inmates rose sharply
(up 35% between 1995 and 2005), there were small changes in 
the racial and Hispanic composition of the inmate population. 

At yearend 2005, black males (547,200) outnumbered white
males (459,700) and Hispanic males (279,000) among inmates 
with a sentence of more than 1 year. About 40% of all male
inmates sentenced to more than 1 year were black.

Comparisons with previous estimates of inmates by race and
Hispanic origin are constrained by new collection 
methodologies. Following guidelines provided by the Office 
of Management and Budget, estimates in 2005 were made 
separately for persons identifying with one race (97%) and
those identifying with two or more races (3%). Adoption of
these guidelines reduced the number and percent of inmates 
identified as non-Hispanic white and black.

An estimated 8% of black males, 
age 25 to 29 in prison in 2005

When incarceration rates are estimated separately by age
group, black males in their twenties and thirties are 
found to have high rates relative to other groups. 
Expressed in terms of percentages, 8.1% of black males age 
25 to 29 were in prison on December 31, 2005, compared to 
2.6% of Hispanic males and about 1.1% of white males in
the same age group. 

Although incarceration rates drop with age, the percentage 
of black males age 45 to 54 in prison at yearend 2005 was 
3.1% a rate higher than the highest rate among Hispanic males 
(2.6% for those age 25 to 29), and more than twice the highest 
rate among white males (1.2% for those age 30 to 34). 

Female incarceration rates, though substantially lower than
male incarceration rates at every age, reveal similar racial 
and ethnic differences. Black females (with an incarceration 
rate of 156 per 100,000) were more than twice as likely as 
Hispanic females (76 per 100,000) and over 3 times more likely 
than white females (45 per 100,000) to have been in prison on 
December 31, 2005. These differences among white, black, and 
Hispanic females were consistent across all age groups. 

Half of State prisoners were violent 
offenders

In absolute numbers an estimated 650,400 inmates in State
prison at yearend 2003 (the latest available offense data) 
were held for violent offenses: 151,500 for murder, 176,600 
for robbery, 124,200 for assault, and 148,800 for rape and 
other sexual assaults. In addition, 262,000 inmates were 
held for property offenses, 250,900 for drug offenses, and 
86,400 for public-order offenses. 

Overall, the proportion of violent offenders increased from
47% in 1995 to 52% in 2003. Property offenders decreased 
from about 23% in 1995 to 21% in 2003; drug offenders 
decreased from 22% to 20%. 

Offenses of State prisoners varied 
by gender, race, and Hispanic origin

More than half (53%) of male State prisoners were serving
time for a violent offense in 2003, compared to around a 
third(35%)of female prisoners. Females were more likely 
than males to be serving time for property offenses (30% 
compared to 20%) and drug offenses (29% compared to 19%).

Offense types also varied by race and Hispanic origin.
Approximately half of white, black, and Hispanic State 
inmates were violent offenders. White prisoners were more 
likely to be serving time for a property offense (27%), 
compared to blacks (18%)and Hispanics (17%). Nearly a
quarter of black State inmates (24%) and Hispanic inmates
(23%) were drug offenders, compared to a seventh of white 
inmates (14%).

Changing Federal prison population 
related to drug and immigration 
offenses

Prisoners sentenced for drug offenses constitute the largest
group of Federal inmates (55%) in 2003, down from 60% in 
1995. On September 30, 2003, the date of the latest 
available data in the Federal Justice Statistics Program, 
Federal prisons held 86,972 sentenced drug offenders, 
compared to 52,782 at yearend 1995. 

Between 1995 and 2003 the number of Federal inmates held for
public-order offenses increased 170%, most of which was 
accounted for by the increase in immigration offenses(up 394%). 
The number of immigration offenders rose from 3,420 in 1995 to
16,903 in 2003. Immigration violators represented over 10% of 
Federal inmates in 2003.

The number of weapons offenders held in Federal prisons
increased about 120%(from 7,446 to 16,377) between 1995 and 
2003. Weapons offenders represented about 10% of the Federal
inmate population in 2003. 

Violent offenders under Federal jurisdiction increased 46%
from 1995 to 2003, and accounted for almost 8% of the total 
growth during the period. Homicide offenders increased 146%, 
from 1,068 in 1995 to 2,632 in 2003. 

While the number of offenders in each major offense category
increased, the number incarcerated for a drug offense 
accounted for the largest percentage of the total growth(49%), 
followed by public-order offenders (38%).

--------------------------------------------
The number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement
detainees increased 2.6% during 2005

The U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE) reported 19,562 detainees on December 31, 2005, up 
from 19,057 at yearend 2004. Nearly two-thirds of these 
detainees (12,509) were held in Federal or State prisons 
and local jails. About a fifth were held in ICE-operated 
facilities (3,782) and private facilities under exclusive 
contract to ICE (2,365). 

The number of detainees under ICE jurisdiction more than 
doubled between 1995 and 2005. This increase most affected 
State prisons, local jails, and other facilities maintaining 
intergovernmental agreements with ICE. These facilities held 
12,509 detainees in 2005, up from 2,286 in 1995. 

Among the 19,562 detainees held for immigration violations 
at yearend 2005, 10,153 had been convicted of criminal 
offenses, and 1,583 had pending criminal cases (not shown 
in table). Detainees convicted of violent offenses (28.0%) 
and drug offenses (28.7%) constituted the largest groups 
under ICE jurisdiction, followed by public-order offenses 
(19.2%) and property offenses (15.3%). 
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
Number of prisoners held by military 
authorities up 6.7% during 2005

There were 2,322 prisoners under military jurisdiction at 
yearend 2005. Fifty-eight percent of the prisoners held by 
the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard 
had a sentence of 1 year or more. At yearend 2005 the Army's 
disciplinary barracks, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and six 
other local or regional Army facilities held the largest 
share of inmates under military jurisdiction (41%). The 6 
Marine Corps facilities held 23% of all inmates; the 34 Air 
Force facilities held 18% of all inmates; and the 11 Navy 
facilities held 17% of all inmates. 

The operational capacity of the 58 military confinement 
facilities was 3,286 (not shown in table). At yearend 2005 
these facilities were operating at 71% of their operational 
capacity. About 87% of prisoners held by the Army, Air 
Force, Navy, and Marine Corps were convicted inmates; 
13% were unconvicted. 
--------------------------------------------

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The Bureau of Justice Statistics(BJS), with the U.S. Census
Bureau as its collection agent, obtains yearend and midyear 
counts of prisoners from departments of correction in each 
of the 50 States and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 

The National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) distinguishes
prisoners in custody from those under jurisdiction. To have 
custody of a prisoner, a State must hold that person in one 
of its facilities. To have jurisdiction means that a State 
has legal authority over the prisoner.  Prisoners under a
State's jurisdiction may be in the custody of a local jail,
another State's prison, or other correctional facilities. 
Some States are unable to provide both custody and 
jurisdiction counts. 

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in locally
administered confinement facilities who are under the 
jurisdiction of local authorities. NPS counts include all 
inmates in State-operated facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, 
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which have 
combined jail-prison systems. NPS excludes inmates held by 
the District of Columbia (DC), which as of yearend 2001 
operated only a jail system. 

Military Corrections Statistics

BJS obtains yearend counts of prisoners in the custody of
U.S. military authorities from the Department of Defense 
Corrections Council. In 1994 the council, comprised of 
representatives from each branch of military service, 
adopted a standardized report (DD Form 2720) with a common 
set of items and definitions. This report gives data on 
persons held in U.S. military confinement facilities inside 
and outside the continental United States, by branch of 
service, gender, race, Hispanic origin, conviction status, 
sentence length, and offense. It also has data on the number 
of facilities, their design, and rated capacities.

Other inmate counts

In 1995 BJS began collecting yearend  counts of prisoners
from the departments of correction in the U.S. Territories 
(American Samoa, Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands) and U.S.
Commonwealths (Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico).
These counts include all inmates for whom the Territory or 
Commonwealth government had legal authority (inmates under
jurisdiction) and all inmates physically located in prison 
or jail facilities (inmates in custody). These counts are 
collected by gender, race, Hispanic origin, and sentence 
length. In addition, BJS obtains reports of the total 
design, rated, and operational capacity of correctional 
facilities.

Estimating age-specific incarceration rates

The number of sentenced prisoners within each group was
estimated for men, women, whites, blacks, and Hispanics. In 
2005 estimates were produced separately for inmates under 
State jurisdiction by combining data by gender from NPS and 
data by race and Hispanic origin from the 2004 Survey of 
Inmates in State Correctional Facilities. 

The Federal Justice Statistics Program(FJSP)provided counts 
of sentenced Federal inmates by age for each demographic 
group at the end of fiscal year 2003. The NPS provided 
counts of sentenced Federal inmates by gender at yearend 
2005 and counts by race and Hispanic origin at midyear 2005. 
The FJSP counts were converted to percentages and multiplied 
by the NPS totals at yearend 2005.

Estimates of the U.S. resident population for January 1, 
2006, by age, gender, race and Hispanic origin were obtained 
from the U.S. Census Bureau. Age-specific rates of 
incarceration for each demographic group were calculated by 
dividing the estimated number of sentenced prisoners in each 
age group by the number of U.S. residents in each age group 
and then multiplying by 100,000. Detailed categories exclude 
persons identifying with two or more races. Totals by gender 
include all inmates and U.S. residents, regardless of racial 
identification.

NPS jurisdiction notes

Alaska — Prisons and jails form one integrated system. 
All NPS data include jail and prison populations. Counts 
exclude individuals in electronic and special monitoring 
programs.

Arizona — Population counts are based on custody data. 
Counts exclude 64 sentenced inmates housed in contracted 
local jail facilities, some awaiting transfer to the DOC.

Inmates held in other States are excluded from counts.

California — Population counts include felons and civil 
addicts who are temporarily absent, such as in court, jail 
or hospital.

Colorado — Population counts include 207 male and 11 female 
inmates in the Youthful Offender System.

Capacity figures exclude 6 privately run facilities under 
contract with the Department of Corrections.  

Connecticut — Prisons and jails form one integrated system. 
All NPS data include jail and prison populations.  
Legislation in 1995 abolished the capacity law so that 
prisons no longer have a rated or operational capacity. 
Design capacity is recorded separately in each facility.

Delaware — Prisons and jails form one integrated system.  
All NPS data include jail and prison populations. 
Jurisdiction counts exclude inmates housed in facilities 
in other States. 

Capacity counts include Department of Correction halfway 
houses.

Federal — Custody counts include inmates housed in 
privately operated secure facilities under contract 
with BOP or with State or local government that has
