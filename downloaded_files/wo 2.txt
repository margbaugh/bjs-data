* Based on the self-reports of victims of violence, women
account for about 14% of violent offenders -- an annual average
of about 2.1 million violent female offenders.

* Male offending equals about 1 violent offender for every 9
males age 10 or older, a per capita rate 6 times that of women.

* Three out of four violent female offenders committed simple
assault.  

* An estimated 28% of violent female offenders are juveniles.  

* Three out of four victims of violent female offenders were
women.

* Nearly 2 out of 3 victims had a prior relationship with the
female offender.

* An estimated 4 in 10 women committing violence were perceived
by the victim as being under the influence of alcohol and/or
drugs at the time of the crime.

* The per capita rate of murder offending by women in 1998 was
the lowest recorded since 1976; the rate at which women commit
murder has been declining since 1980.

* In 1998 there were an estimated 3.2 million arrests of women
-- accounting for about 22% of all arrests that year.  The per
capita rate of arrest among juvenile females was nearly twice
the adult female rate.

* Since 1990 the number of female defendants convicted of
felonies in State courts has grown at more than 2 times the rate
of increase in male defendants.  

* In 1998 an estimated 950,000 women were under the care,
custody, or control of correctional agencies -- probation or
parole agencies supervising 85% of these offenders in the
community.  The total equals a rate of about 1 woman involved
with the criminal justice system for every 109 adult women in
the U.S. Population. 

* Women under supervision by justice system agencies were
mothers of an estimated 1.3 million minor children.

* Nearly 6 in 10 women in State prisons had experienced physical
or sexual abuse in the past; just over a third of imprisoned
women had been abused by an intimate in the past; and just under
a quarter reported prior abuse by a family member.

* About 84,000 women were confined in prisons in 1998.  In 1996
the average sentence and time served for women were shorter than
for males with equivalent offenses.

Population estimates from the Census Bureau for July 1, 1998,
indicate that women account for more than half the population
age 10 or older:

Females           119,010,000         51.6 
Males             111,851,000         48.4 

The racial and ethnic composition of the general population age
10 or older varies slightly when males and females are compared.
Non-Hispanic black females outnumber non-Hispanic black males
by nearly 1.9 million, accounting for more than a quarter of the
total difference in the number of males and females in the
general population. Minorities compose a slightly higher
percentage of the female population (26.2%) than of the male
population (25.9%).  Nearly a third of the disparity in the
number of females versus males in the general population is
accounted for by the larger number of minority females.  

The average age of females in the general population is about 2½
years older than that of males. The largest age disparity, about
3 years, is found among black non-Hispanic females compared to
black non-Hispanic males.  Among females, Hispanic women have
the lowest average age, 29.6 years, while white non-Hispanic
women have the highest, 39.6 years.

Violent victimizers                                        

During an average year, based on the period 1993-97, victims of
violence attributed the crimes they experienced to an estimated
2.1 million female violent offenders and 13.1 million male
violent offenders.

 ---------------------------------------------------------

About 1 out of 7 violent offenders described by victims was a
female. Women accounted for 1 in 50 offenders committing a
violent sex offense including rape and sexual assault, 1 in 14
robbers, 1 in 9 offenders committing aggravated assault, and
more than 1 in 6 offenders described as having committed a
simple assault. 

Nearly 3 in 4 violent victimizations committed by female
offenders were simple assaults; just over half the violence of
male offenders is described as simple assault.

The rate of male violent offending translated into about 1
violent offender for every 9 males age 10 or older in the
general population; the rate of female violent offending was
equal to about 1 violent offender for every 56 females age 10 or
older.

Per capita rates of offending among both males and females
decreased from the peak rates recorded in 1994.  Rates of
committing violent crime in 1997 were 29% lower for males and
25% lower among females.

More than half of female violent offenders were described by
victims as white, and just over a third were described as black.
About 1 in 10 were described as belonging to another race
(Asian, Pacific Islander, Native Hawaiian, American Indian,
Aleut, or Eskimo).

Black and white offenders accounted for nearly equal proportions
of women committing robbery and aggravated assault; however,
simple assault offenders were more likely to be described as
white.

Among violent female offenders, 53% committed the offense while
alone, and 40% were with others, all of whom were female.  Among
male offenders, 47% were alone, and 51% were with other males
when the offense occurred.  About 8% of violent female offenders
committed their offense together with at least one male
offender; by contrast, about 1% of male violent offenders
committed the offense in the company of a female offender.

Victims of violence provided very similar descriptions of their
perceptions of the ages of both female and male violent
offenders.  For each age group -- juveniles, young adults, and
those 30 or older -- victims reported little variation in
offender age between the two genders.

Juveniles accounted for about 28% of female violent offenders,
nearly identical to the juvenile percentage (26%) found among
violent male offenders.



Characteristics of victims of female violent offenders

Overall, female-to-female violence accounted for 11% of all
violent offenders described by victims.  An additional 3% of
violent offenders were women who attacked males.

Violent offenders most often victimized persons of the same
gender.  More than 3 out of 4 female offenders had a female
victim; about 7 out of 10 males had a male victim.  About 29% of
violent offenders had a victim of a different gender;  9 out of
10 of these offenders were males with female victims.

Male and female violent offenders differed substantially in
their relationship to those they victimized.  An estimated 62%
of female violent offenders had a prior relationship with the
victim as an intimate, relative, or acquaintance.  By contrast,
about 36% of male violent offenders were estimated to have known
the victim.

Victims who were intimates accounted for an identical percentage
of both male and female violent offenders.

When women committed their violent offense against men, 35% of
the offenders attacked an intimate or relative.  By contrast, 8%
of victimizations of other females involved  intimates or family
members.  For both male and female victims, the proportion of
female offenders attacking strangers was the same.

For nearly half of female offenders, the violent offense took
place either at or near the victim's home or at school.  Less
than a third of male offenders carried out their crimes in these
locations.

According to victim self-reports, female offenders account for
about 1 in 4 offenders committing violence at a school.  Women
were also estimated to account for about 1 in 8 violent
offenders in the workplace and 1 in 6 violent offenders
committing the offense in the victim's home.

There were few differences between male and female violent
offenders in victim perceptions of drug or alcohol use at the
time of the offense.  About 4 in 10 male and female violent
offenders were reported by victims to have been using alcohol,
drugs, or both at the time of the offense.



Consequences of female violence 

----------------------------------------------------------

Average loss to victim                        $595      $943
------------------------------------------------------------- 


The consequences of male violence were generally more serious
for the victim in terms of weapon use, injury, and out-of-pocket
losses to the victim.  

Male offenders were more likely than female offenders (28% to
15%) to have used a weapon such as a blunt object, knife, or
firearm in the commission of the violent offense.

Serious injuries, such as broken bones, being knocked
unconscious, concussions, knife wounds, or gunshot wounds, were
slightly more associated with male offenders; however, the
likelihood of hospital treatment for the victims of male and
female offenders was about the same.  An estimated 865,000
violent offenders were responsible for crimes against victims
whose injuries resulted in hospital treatment; women accounted
for about 12% of these offenders.

The largest out-of-pocket cost item for victims of female
violence was medical expenses which averaged $1,127, nearly $550
less than victims of male violence experienced.  Lost pay due to
injury to victims of female violence averaged $311 and lost pay
for court appearances and other reasons cost victims an average
of $513 when the offender was a female -- both of these were less
than half the losses victims experienced when the offender was a
male.


Women who murder

Since 1993 both male and female rates of committing murder have
declined.  Rates of committing murder in 1998 were the lowest
since statistics were first collected in 1976.  The estimated
rate for murder offending by women in 1998 was 1.3 per 100,000 --
about 1 murderer for every 77,000 women.  The male rate of
murder offending in 1998 was 11.5 per 100,000, about 1 murderer
for every 8,700 males.

The 1998 rate of committing murder by women was just over 40% of
the rate in 1976.  Since 1980 rates for women have been steadily
declining.  For male offending, the peak rate occurred in 1991,
with 20.7 murderers per 100,000 males (about 1 murderer for
every 4,800 males); the rate in 1998 was just over half of what
it had been in 1991.

-------------------------------------------



The victim-offender relationship differed substantially between
female and male murderers.  Of the 60,000 murders committed by
women between 1976 and 1997 just over 60% were against an
intimate or family member; among the 400,000 murders committed
by men over the same period, 20% were against family members or
intimates.  

An estimated 1 in 14 murders by a female offender and 1 in 4
murders by a male offender was committed against a victim who
was a stranger to the offender.

Between 1976 and 1997, juveniles accounted for just over 6% of
the murders committed by female offenders, or approximately
4,000 murders.  In 1976 there were an estimated 226 juvenile
female murderers compared to an estimated 153 in 1997.  The only
group of women for whom the rate of murder offending has not
continued to  decrease are those age 18-24.  The per capita rate
of committing murder for women of this age reached its lowest
point in 1995, and by 1997 had climbed 25%.

Nearly 6 in 10 female murderers are black.  The age distribution
of white and black female murderers is quite similar, though
among older offenders (50 or older) black females account for
less than half of female murderers.

---------------------------------------------------------

Just over half of women committing murder and two-thirds of
males committing murder used a firearm.  Female offenders
were substantially more likely than male murderers to have
used a knife or other sharp object to commit the crime.

---------------------------------------------------------
Parents who kill 

Between 1976 and 1997 parents and stepparents murdered nearly
11,000 children.  Mothers and stepmothers committed about half
of these child murders.  Sons and stepsons accounted for 52% of
those killed by mothers and 57% of those killed by fathers. 
Mothers were responsible for a higher share of children killed
during infancy while fathers were more likely to have been
responsible for the murders of children age 8 or older.
---------------------------------------------------------


Arrests

In 1998 there were an estimated 3.2 million arrests of women,
accounting for about a fifth of all arrests by law enforcement
agencies.  Women were about 17% of those arrested for the Part I
violent crimes (murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault)
and 29% of those arrested for Part I property crimes (burglary,
larceny, and motor-vehicle theft).  An estimated 22% of all
female arrests (Part I and Part II) were of juveniles -- about
700,000 juvenile female arrests in 1998.  Juvenile female
arrestees accounted for a higher percentage of women arrested
for motor vehicle theft, liquor law violations, and vandalism.

Note:  Violent offenses, which include rape, and property offenses are the Part I
offenses  In the FBI Uniform Crime Reports.  Total arrests includes Part I and 
Part II offenses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

The numbers of arrests in 1998 translate into about 1 arrest for
every 22 female juveniles (age 10-17) and 1 arrest for every 42
adult women (age 18 or older).  For Part I violent     crimes,
there was 1 arrest of a female juvenile for every 794 girls in
the general population and 1 arrest of an adult female for every
1,099 adult women residents.  Larceny, the offense category with
the most arrests, equaled about 1 arrest for every 105 girls  
under age 18 and 1 arrest for every 337 women age 18 or older.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   

In 1998 there were more than a quarter million female drug
arrests, accounting for about 18% of all arrests for drug law
violations.  Drug arrest rates in 1998 were 1 for every 538
juvenile females in the resident population and 1 for every 426
adult women residents.

Per capita arrest rates for Part I violent crimes among juvenile
females (17 and younger) and among young adult females (18-24)
have risen substantially from the early 1980's.  The juvenile
arrest rate for violent offenses in 1995 was about 22 times the
rate in 1985.  However, juvenile rates have declined in each
year since 1995.  By contrast, young adult female rates of
arrest for violence continue to climb with the 1997 rate about
80% above the rate 10 years earlier and at the highest level
recorded.



Female defendants in State courts

Women accounted for about 16% of all felons convicted in State
courts in 1996.  Women were 8% of convicted violent felons, 23%
of property felons, and 17% of drug felons.  Women defendants
accounted for 41% of all felons convicted of forgery, fraud, and
embezzlement.  The majority of male and female felony defendants
in the 75 largest counties in the United States were either
charged with violence or were recidivists.  An estimated 27% of
male and 42% of female felony defendants in State courts in
large counties had no history of prior convictions and had not
been charged with a violent offense. 

State courts have recorded substantial growth in the number of
female defendants convicted of felonies.  Between 1990 and 1996,
the number of convicted female defendants grew at 22 times the
rate of increase among male defendants.

For women defendants convicted in State courts, nearly 90% of
the increase in the number of violent felons was accounted for
by aggravated assault, perhaps reflecting increased prosecution
of women for domestic violence.  More than half of the increase
in the number of female defendants convicted of property
felonies was attributable to rising numbers of those
convicted of forgery, fraud, or embezzlement.

---------------------------------------------- 


Thirty-seven percent of women convicted of a felony in State
courts in 1996 had been charged with a drug offense, about the
same proportion of all convicted felons as in 1990.  Over the
period 1990-96, the number of drug trafficking convictions grew
by 34% and the number of convictions for drug possession
increased 41%.

For every category of major crime for the period 1990-96 --
violent,  property, drugs, and other felonies -- the rate of
increase in the number of convicted female defendants has
outpaced the changes in the number of convicted male defendants.
Property felonies, in particular, have evidenced a very large
disparity in rates of change; from 1990 to 1996, the number of
males convicted of property felonies dropped about -2% while
convicted female defendants increased 44%.

---------------------
Adjudication outcomes

About two-thirds of both female and male defendants pleaded
guilty.  Small percentages of both were found guilty after a
bench or jury trial.  About 3 in 10 of both were acquitted or
were dismissed.  The apparently larger share of women than men
charged with a violent felony and gaining an acquittal or
dismissal merits further study

Female corrections populations

In 1998 there were an estimated 951,900 women under the care,
custody, or control of adult criminal justice authorities.  This
translates into a rate of about 1 out of every 109 adult women
in the United States -- nearly 1% of adult women -- having some
kind of correctional status on any given day.  About 85% of the
female corrections population were being supervised in the
community, and 15% were confined in prisons and jails.

------------------------------------------------------------------


Women offenders account for about 16% of the total corrections
population in 1998 (5,890,300).  Women represent about 21% of
those on probation, 11% of those in local jails, just under 6%
of those in prisons, and 12% of those on parole.

Population growth has occurred in each component of corrections.
The number of women per capita involved in corrections overall
has grown 48% since 1990, compared to a 27% increase in the
number of men per capita.  Between 1990 and 1998 the per capita
number of women under probation supervision climbed 40%; the
jail rate grew 60%; the imprisonment rate increased 88%; and the
per capita number of offenders under parole supervision was up
80%.

Offense composition among women with a corrections status varies
with the type of status.  Violence and drug trafficking, for
example, account for 17% of women on probation, 24% of those
sentenced to local jails, 46% of those incarcerated in State
prisons, and 65% of those confined in Federal prisons.  By
contrast, DWI offenses account for 18% of women on probation, 7%
of those sentenced to local jails, and 2% of those held in State
prisons.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most violent female offenders are not confined: there are nearly
65,000 women convicted of violence under supervision by
probation authorities compared to about 3,300 convicted violent
offenders in local jails, 21,000 in State prisons, and fewer
than 1,000 in Federal prison.  Similarly, among convicted female
drug traffickers, an estimated 58,000 are on probation, 5,300
are held in local jails, 13,500 in State prisons, and about
5,300 in Federal prison.

The offense composition among women in State prison has been
changing.  The proportion who had been convicted of violent and
property crimes has been decreasing while the proportion of drug
and public-order offenders has been growing.



Characteristics of women serving a sentence 

Race and Hispanic origin

While nearly two-thirds of women under probation supervision are
white, nearly two-thirds of those confined in local jails and
State and Federal prisons are minority -- black, Hispanic and
other races.  Hispanics account for about 1 in 7 women in State
prisons but nearly 1 in 3 female prisoners in Federal custody.


Age

Women in prison, both State and Federal, are older than their
counterparts in local jails or under probation supervision. 
While about 1 in 5 women on probation or in local jails are
under age 25, 1 in 8 State prisoners and 1 in 11 Federal
prisoners are of this age.  Nearly a quarter of Federal prison
inmates are at least 45 years old.   


Marital status

Adult women under correctional care, custody, or control are
substantially more likely than the equivalent general population
to have never been married.  Nearly half of women in both State
prisons and local jails have never been married.  


Education

The majority of women involved with the justice system are at
least high school graduates.  An estimated 60% of those on
probation, 55% of those in local jails, 56% of those in State
prisons, and 73% of those in Federal prison have completed high
school, and 30% - 40% of high school graduates have attended
some college or more.

Inmates' children

Approximately 7 in 10 women under correctional sanction have
minor children -- children under the age of 18.   An estimated
72% of women on probation, 70% of women held in local jails, 65%
of women in State prisons, and 59% of women in Federal prisons
have young children.

Note: Only children under age 18 are counted.
------------------------------------------------------------------ 


Women under correctional care, custody, or supervision with
minor children reported an average of 2.11 children of this age.
Those on probation reported the fewest, 2.07 young children per
woman with children while those in State prison reported an
average of 2.38 children under age 18.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Table 18

In 1997 an estimated 2.8% of all children under age 18 have at least one parent
in a local jail or a State or Federal prison.  About 1 in 40 children have
an incarcerated father, and 1 in 359 children have an incarcerated mother.

Note:  In 1997 69,898,000 children under age 18 were in the resident population.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


These estimates translate into more than 1.3 million minor
children who are the offspring of women under correctional
sanction; more than a quarter million of these children have
mothers who are serving time in prison or jail.  About
two-thirds of women in State prisons and half of women in
Federal prisons who had young children had lived with those
children prior to entering prison.  

Male inmates in State prisons are estimated to have been fathers
to about 1.1 million children under age 18, about 11 times the
number of minor children attributable to female inmates.  About
64% of women inmates with minor children had lived with those
children prior to admission to prison; among men, 44% had
resided with their minor children before imprisonment.  Males in
Federal prisons had nearly 15 times as many minor children in
total as female Federal inmates; 8 in 10 of these men and just
under 6 in 10 women resided with the children prior to entering prison.


Economic circumstances

Female prisoners generally had more difficult economic
circumstances than male inmates prior to entering prison.  About
4 in 10 women in State prison reported that they had been
employed full-time prior to their arrest.  By contrast, nearly 6
in 10 male inmates had been working full-time prior to arrest. 
About 37% of women and 28% of men had incomes of less than $600
per month prior to arrest.  While just under 8% of male inmates
had been receiving welfare assistance prior to arrest, nearly
30% of female inmates reported receiving welfare assistance at
the time just before the arrest which brought them to prison.

In 1997 an estimated 2,200 women serving time in State prisons
were HIV-positive, about 3.5% of the female inmate population. 
An estimated 20,200 male inmates, about 2.2% of the male
population, was HIV-positive.  The percentage of the female
inmate population that was HIV-positive peaked in 1993 at 4.2%.

Forty-four percent of women under correctional authority
reported that they were physically or sexually assaulted at some
time during their lives.  Sixty-nine percent of women reporting
an assault said that it had occurred before age 18.

Alcohol and drug use

About half of women offenders confined in State prisons had been
using alcohol, drugs, or both at the time of the offense for
which they had been incarcerated.  Among these women offenders,
drug use at the time of the offense was reported more often than
alcohol use, a different pattern from that found among male
offenders in State prisons.  On every measure of drug use (ever
used, using regularly, using in month before the offense, and
using at time of offense), women offenders in State prisons
reported higher usage-- 40% of women inmates compared to 32% of
male inmates had been under the influence of drugs when the
crime occurred.  By contrast, every measure of alcohol use was
higher for male inmates than for female inmates.  An estimated
25% of women on probation, 29% of women in local jails, 29% of
women in State prisons, and 15% of women in Federal prisons had
been consuming alcohol at the time of the offense.

Just over half of women confined in State prisons reported
drinking alcohol in the year before the current offense compared
to two-thirds of male offenders in State prisons.  Daily
drinkers accounted for about 25% of female inmates and 29% of
male inmates.  At the time of the offense, 29% 
of women offenders and 38% of male inmates had been under the
influence of alcohol.

About 6 in 10 women in State prison described themselves as
using drugs in the month before the offense, 5 in 10 described
themselves as a daily user of drugs, and 4 in 10 were under the
influence of drugs at the time of the offense.  Nearly 1 in 3
women serving time in State prisons said they had committed the
offense which brought them to prison in order to obtain money to
support their need for drugs.

Substance abusing women inmates were more likely than
drug/alcohol-involved male inmates to report having received
treatment.  Nearly 56% of women substance abusers in State
prisons compared to 41% of males had ever been in substance
abuse treatment;  20% of women and 14% of men had received such
treatment since prison admission.  Nearly a third of both men
and women inmates with substance abuse problems indicated that
they had participated in some other type of voluntary program,
such as Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous, since
entering prison.



Criminal history

About 65% of women confined in State prisons had a history of
prior convictions; about 77% of men serving time 
in State prisons had a prior conviction record.  Male inmates
were twice as likely as female inmates to have had a juvenile
history (38% versus 19%); 7 out of 10 male inmates and 6 out of
10 female inmates had an adult history of convictions.  About 1
in 6 women inmates and nearly 1 in 3 male inmates had criminal
records spanning both their juvenile and adult years.

Male inmates had also acquired more convictions than women. 
While about a third of women prisoners had 3 or more prior
convictions, about 43% of male inmates had records containing at
least 3 prior convictions.

Women in prison were substantially more likely than male inmates
to have had a correctional status at the time 
of the offense which brought them to prison.  About 1 in 3 women
inmates had been on probation when their offense occurred
compared to 1 in 5 male inmates.

About 40% of female first-timers and 65% of male first-timers
serving a prison sentence had been convicted of a violent
offense.  This translates into about 20% of all women inmates
and 8% of all male inmates incarcerated in State prisons
nationwide as offenders serving their first sentence after
conviction for a nonviolent crime.


State and Federal prisoners

At the end of 1998, 84,427 women were under the jurisdiction of
State and Federal correctional authorities.  Of these, 75,241
were held by the States and 9,186 were held by the Federal
Bureau of Prisons.  Between 1990 and 1998 the number of women
confined in prisons grew by an annual average of 8.5%; over the
same years, prison populations nationwide increased an average
6.7% annually.  In 1990 State and Federal prisons housed 44,065
female prisoners, just over half the number held in 1998.

Among State prisoners in 1998, 44%  (33,345) were held by States
in the South.  The incarceration rate in the South was the
highest of any region-- 65 female prisoners per 100,000
residents.  The West accounted for 25% (18,845) of the total
State prison population and had a per capita rate of
imprisonment of 58 per 100,000.  Midwestern States, with about
18% of female State prisoners (13,684), had a rate of 42
prisoners per 100,000 residents. The Northeast accounted for 12%
of women held by States (9,367) and had an incarceration rate of
31.  

In 1998 the highest per capita rate of confinement among the
States was in Oklahoma (122), and the lowest was in Maine and
Vermont (9 in each).  The District of Columbia had a rate equal
to 173 per 100,000 female residents.

Sentences to prison

Prison admissions

In 1996 women accounted for about 9% of all State prison
admissions, 10% of those admitted from courts, and 8% of revoked
violator admissions.

For all types of offenses except property offenses, the
sentences received by women were shorter than those received by
men;  the average sentences for property offenses were the same.
Short sentences on average may reflect overall differences in
criminal background, particularly the prevalence of violence in
the backgrounds of males sentenced to prison.

Women accounted for more than 10% of those admitted to State
prisons for negligent manslaughter (13% were women), larceny
(18%), arson (12%), fraud (31%), drug possession (14%), and drug
trafficking (11%).  Women accounted for about 1% of those
admitted for rape and sexual assault.  

About 26% of women admitted to prison following a court sentence
had been convicted of larceny or fraud (including forgery and
embezzlement) --offenses accounting for about 10% of male
admissions.



Prison releases

Women accounted for just over 9% of those discharged from State
prisons in 1996.

Among those released, the median time served
for murder was 80 months for men and 60 months for women.

As found for sentencing, the median length of stay for women was
less than that for men for every type of offense.  This may be a
reflection of the more extensive criminal histories of men and
the higher prevalence of convictions for violence in their
backgrounds.    



Death sentences

At the end of 1997, 44 inmates, or 1.3% of the death row
population, were women.  During the year, two women were
sentenced to death and five had their death sentences removed. 
States holding women under sentence of death were C

Of the 44 women under sentence of death, 30 were white and 14
were black.  One white inmate and one black inmate were Hispanic.

For women under sentence of death, an average of 78 months had
elapsed since sentencing, about 8 months less than for males.

Between January 1, 1977, and December 31, 1997, a total of 432
persons were executed including 1 white, non-Hispanic female in
North Carolina in 1984.  During 1998, 2 women were executed (1
each in Texas and Florida).


Recidivism

In 1996, women accounted for about 11% of successful discharges
from parole and 8% of unsuccessful parole terminations. 
Overall, about 45% of women for whom parole supervision was
ended in 1996 were returned to prison or had absconded.  Women
successfully discharged from parole supervision had spent an
average of 15 months in prison on their sentence and 20 months
under supervision in the community.  Unsuccessful female parole
discharges had spent an average of 17 months in prison and 18
months under community supervision prior to termination.

A 3-year followup of a sample representing 109,000 persons
(6,400 females among them) discharged from prisons in 11 States
in 1983 found that 52% of women were rearrested.  An estimated
39% of women discharged from prisons were reconvicted within 3
years and 33% were returned to prison.  Prior arrest history was
an important predictor of post-prison recidivism: among women
with only the one arrest for which they had been imprisoned, 21%
were rearrested within 3 years.  Among women with 2-3 prior
arrests, 33% were rearrested; those with 4-6 prior arrests had a
47% rearrest rate; among those with 7-10 priors, 69% were
rearrested; and, nearly 8 out of 10 women with 11 or more priors
were rearrested.        


-------------------------------------------------------------
The prevalence of imprisonment among women 

The most recent BJS estimate of the lifetime chance of being
sent to Federal or State prison at least once indicates that
overall about 11 women out of 1,000 will be incarcerated at some
time in their lives.  The estimates further show that about 5
out of 1,000 white women, 36 out of 1,000 black women, and 15
out of 1,000 Hispanic women will be subjected to imprisonment
during their lifetime.  

For males, BJS estimates indicate that about 90 out of 1,000
males will be incarcerated during their lives; 44 white males,
285 black males, and 160 Hispanic males for every 1,000 in the
general population will serve time in a Federal or State prison.

National Crime Victimization Survey

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is one of two
statistical series maintained by the Department of Justice to
learn about the extent to which crime is occurring.  The NCVS,
which gathers data on criminal victimization from a national
sample of household respondents, provides annual estimates of
crimes experienced by the public without regard to whether a law
enforcement agency was called about the crime.  Initiated in
1972, the NCVS was designed to complement what is known about
crimes reported to local law enforcement agencies under the
FBI's annual compilation known as the Uniform Crime Reports
(UCR).

The NCVS gathers information about crime and its consequences
from a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents age 12
or older about any crimes they may have experienced. For
personal contact crimes the survey asks about the perpetrator,
including gender. 

One of the important contributions of the NCVS is that it
permits multiple years of responses to the same questions to be
analyzed, facilitating research on small subgroups of the
population.  For this study 5 years of NCVS data (1993-97) were
combined, resulting in more than 1 million interviews, just over
40,000 of which were conducted among persons experiencing
violent victimizations.  Criminal Victimization 1998:  Changes

Uniform Crime Reporting program

The UCR program of the FBI provides another opportunity to
examine the issue of crime and violence committed by women
offenders through the incident-based Supplementary Homicide
Report program and the summary compilation of national arrest
data.  The summary-based arrest component of the UCR provides
data by gender of arrestees for both Part I crimes and the less
serious Part II crimes.  

In 1997, data by gender and offense were available for about 2
out of 3 arrests nationwide (about 10.5 million of the estimated
15.3 million arrests that year).  Females are estimated to
account for about 16% of those arrested for Part I violent
crimes. 

The 1997 UCR does indicate reduced reporting of arrests by
gender (table 42) and that a number of jurisdictions (Kentucky,
Illinois, Montana, District of Columbia, Florida, and New
Hampshire) supplied either limited or no arrest data.  Some of
these incomplete or missing States, notably Illinois and
Florida, may affect the national estimates for females.

Supplementary Homicide Reports

FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) is a part of the UCR
program. Supplemental data about homicide incidents are
submitted monthly with detail on location, victim, and offender
characteristics. These reports include information on the month
and year of an offense, on the reporting agency and its
residential population, on the age, race, and sex of victims and
offenders, and on the victim/offender relationship, weapon use,
and circumstance of the crime. For the years 1976-97,
contributing agencies provided supplemental data for 425,012 of
the estimated 464,590 murders. Supplemental data were also
reported for 469,220 of the estimated 513,051 offenders.

State Court Processing Statistics 

State Court Processing Statistics (SCPS) (formerly, through
1994, National Pretrial  Reporting Program (NPRP)) provides data
on the criminal justice processing of persons charged with
felonies in 40 jurisdictions representative of the 75 largest
counties, which account for about half the serious crime
nationwide. The program prospectively tracks felony defendants
from charging by the prosecutor until disposition of their cases
or for a maximum of 12 months. Data are obtained on demographic
characteristics, arrest offense, criminal justice status at time
of arrest, prior arrests and convictions, bail and pretrial
release, court appearance record, rearrests while on pretrial
release, type and outcome of adjudication, and type and length
of sentence.  This biennial data collection originated in 1988.

National Judicial Reporting Program

The National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP) is a sample
survey of court records on convicted felons.  Using a nationally
representative sample of counties, NJRP compiles
individual-level data on felons convicted in State courts.  Data
elements include conviction offense, sentence received,
case-processing, methods of conviction, and a variety of other
defendant characteristics. The NJRP first reported felony
sentencing data for 1986 and has provided national estimates at
2-year intervals.

National Prisoner Statistics 

The National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) data series produces
annual and semi-annual national and State-level data on the
numbers of prisoners in State and Federal prison facilities
(NPS-1).  Since 1926 the Federal government has published data
annually on the prisoner count in each State, the District of
Columbia, and the Federal prison system.

A second data collection in the NPS series yields annual
national and State-level data on persons sentenced to death and
those executed (NPS-8). Data collected include offender
demographic characteristics, prior criminal histories, and
criminal justice system status at the time of the capital
offense, and time spent on death row. Data are available on
executions since 1930 and sentencing since 1973.

National Corrections Reporting Program

The National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) has collected
data annually since 1983 on prison admissions and releases and
on parole entries and discharges in participating jurisdictions.
 Demographic information, conviction offenses, sentence length,
minimum time to be served, credited jail time, type of
admission, type of release, and time served are collected from
individual prisoner records.

Surveys of probationers and jail  and prison inmates

BJS also conducts national surveys of persons under probation
supervision and those confined in local jails and State and
Federal prisons.  These nationally representative surveys are
the principal source of information on those serving time
following a conviction:  their backgrounds, their prior criminal
histories, and the circumstances surrounding the offense for
which they had been incarcerated.  Both jail and prison surveys
obtain from violent offenders details about the offender's
relationship to the victim.
