Jail Inmates at Midyear 2013 - Statistical Tables

Todd D. Minton and Daniela Golinelli, Ph.D.,
BJS Statisticians

After a peak in the number of inmates confined in county and city jails at 
midyear 2008 (785,533), the jail population was significantly lower by 
midyear 2013 (731,208) (figure 1, table 1). However, the estimated decline 
between midyear 2012 and 2013 was not statistically significant. California’s 
jails experienced an increase of about 12,000 inmates since midyear 2011. 
(For more information on California, see the text box on page 2.)

The jail incarceration rate—the confined population per 100,000 U.S. 
residents—declined slightly between midyear 2012 (237 per 100,000) and 2013 
(231 per 100,000). This decline continues a downward trend from a high of 259 
jail inmates per 100,000 residents in 2007.

Males represented at least 86% of the jail population since 2000. The female 
inmate population increased 10.9% (up 10,000 inmates) between midyear 2010 
and 2013, while the male population declined 4.2% (down 27,500 inmates) 
(table 2, table 3). The female jail population grew by an average of about 1% 
each year between 2005 and 2013. In comparison, the male jail population 
declined an annual average of less than 1% every year since 2005 (not shown).

White inmates accounted for 47% of the total jail population, blacks 
represented 36%, and Hispanics represented 15% at midyear 2013. About 4,600 
juveniles were held in local jails (less than 1% of the confined population), 
down from 5,400 during the same period in 2012.

At midyear 2013, about 6 in 10 inmates were not convicted, but were in jail 
awaiting court action on a current charge—a rate unchanged since 2005. About 
4 in 10 inmates were sentenced offenders or convicted offenders awaiting 
sentencing. From the first significant decline in the overall jail population 
since midyear 2009, the unconvicted population (down 24,000 inmates) outpaced 
the decline in the convicted inmate population (down 12,000 inmates).

California Public Safety Realignment
*************************************

On May 23, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ruling by a lower three-
judge court that the State of California must reduce its prison population to 
137.5% of design capacity (approximately 110,000 prisoners) within 2 years
to alleviate overcrowding. In response, the California State Legislature and 
governor enacted two laws—AB 109 and AB 117—to reduce the number of inmates 
housed in state prisons starting October 1, 2011.

The Public Safety Realignment (PSR) policy is designed to reduce the prison 
population through normal attrition of the existing population while placing 
new nonviolent, nonserious, nonsex offenders under county jurisdiction for
incarceration in local jail facilities. Inmates released from local jails 
will be placed under a county-directed postrelease community supervision 
program instead of the state’s parole system. The state is giving additional 
funding to the 58 counties in California to deal with the increased
correctional population and responsibility; however, each county must develop 
a plan for custody and post-custody that best serves its needs.

After record low jail populations between yearend 2010 and yearend 2011, the 
California jail population increased by an estimated 7,600 inmates between 
yearend 2011 and midyear 2012 and by an estimated 3,500 inmates between
midyear 2012 and midyear 2013 (figure 2).

At midyear 2013, characteristics of inmates held in California jails differed 
from the national jail population (when excluding California), including 
inmates’ race and conviction status. In California jails, Hispanics accounted
for 45% of the total inmate population, whites represented 32%, and blacks 
represented 20% of inmates (not shown). In comparison, Hispanics accounted 
for 11% of the national inmate population (excluding California), whites
represented 49%, and blacks represented 38% of the jail inmate population. 
There was also a slight difference in the inmate conviction status. At 
midyear 2013, 43% of inmates held in California jails were convicted, 
compared to 37% confined in non-California jails. No differences were
found among male and female and adult and juvenile inmate populations.
****************************************************

*************************************
The majority of the jail inmates are 
held in less than 10% of jails
*************************************

The largest jails held 48% of the inmate population at midyear 2013, but 
accounted for 6% of all jail jurisdictions nationwide (table 4). In 
comparison, the smallest jail jurisdictions held 3% of the inmate population, 
but accounted for 38% of all jail jurisdictions. Jail jurisdictions with an 
average daily population (ADP) of 50 to 99 inmates and 100 to 249 inmates 
accounted for equal shares (about 20% each) of jail jurisdictions. Combined, 
these jail jurisdictions accounted for 18% of all inmates. Jail jurisdictions 
with an ADP of 250 to 999 inmates accounted for 17% of all jail 
jurisdictions, but held 31% of all inmates at midyear 2013. Similar patterns 
were observed in 2012 for all categories.

****************************************
Increase in new bed space between 2012 
and 2013 was smaller than the average 
annual increase between 2000 and 2012
****************************************

Rated capacity in jails reached 891,271 beds at midyear 2013, an increase of 
1.6% (up 13,875 beds) from 877,396 beds at midyear 2012; however, the change 
was not statistically significant (figure 3, table 5). The increase between 
midyear 2012 and 2013 was smaller than the average annual increase each year 
between 2000 and 2012 (up 2.2% or 19,003 beds). Rated capacity is the maximum 
number of beds or inmates allocated to each jail facility by a state or local 
rating official.

The percentage of rated capacity at midyear 2013 (82%) was the lowest since 
1984 (86%). At midyear 2013, jail jurisdictions holding 250 to 499 inmates 
reported the highest percentage of occupied bed space (87%), compared to 
jails holding fewer than 50 inmates (64%) (table 6).

In addition to measuring the rated capacity occupied based on the inmate 
count at midyear, the measurement can be based on the ADP in jail 
jurisdictions during the 12-month period ending June 30, 2013, and by the 
number of inmates on the most crowded day during June 2013. Using these two 
measures, the nation’s jails operated at about 82% of rated capacity on an 
average day and about 88% of rated capacity on their most crowded day in June 
2013.

While the confined population and rated jail capacity both increased at 
roughly comparable rates from 2000 through 2008, the growth rates have 
diverged since 2008. The confined population declined by 1.4% on average per 
year, while rated capacity increased by 1.5% on average per year. The 
increase in capacity and decrease in confined population almost equally 
contributed to the decline in the percentage of capacity occupied, from 95% 
at midyear 2008 to 82% at midyear 2013.

Jail jurisdictions holding between 100 and 249 inmates experienced the 
largest difference in change rates between rated capacity and the jail inmate 
population (figure 4). From midyear 2008 to 2013, these jail jurisdictions 
reported a decrease of 1% in their inmate custody population and a 17% 
increase in their rated capacity. The smallest jail jurisdictions, which held 
fewer than 50 inmates, reported the smallest difference between change in 
their inmate population (down 7.2%) and change in rated capacity (up 2.6%). 
All other jail jurisdiction categories experienced a decline in their midyear 
jail population and an increase in their rated capacity.

****************************************
Local jails admitted 11.7 million 
persons during the 12-month period 
ending midyear 2013.
****************************************

Local jails admitted an estimated 11.7 million persons during the 12-month 
period ending June 30, 2013, remaining stable since 2011 (11.8 million) and 
down from a peak of 13.6 million admissions in 2008. The number of persons 
admitted in 2013 was 16 times the size of the ADP (731,352) during the 12-
month period ending June 30, 2013. (See Methodology for methods used to 
estimate admissions.)

More than a third of admissions during the last week of June 2013 were to the 
largest jail jurisdictions (table 7). In comparison, jail jurisdictions 
holding fewer than 50 inmates accounted for 7% of all jail admissions. For 
these jails, the number of inmates admitted was 34 times the size of the ADP 
between 2012 and 2013. These small jail jurisdictions also experienced the 
highest turnover rate (121%). The turnover rate was the smallest in large 
jail jurisdictions (44%). Higher turnover rates mean larger numbers of 
admissions and releases relative to the size of the ADP.

Methodology

Annual Survey of Jails
***********************

In years between the complete census of local jails, the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (BJS) conducts the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ). ASJ uses a 
stratified probability sample of jail jurisdictions to estimate the number 
and characteristics of local inmates nationwide. For the 2013 ASJ, the U.S. 
Census Bureau, as the collection agent, drew a sample of 891 jail 
jurisdictions (including 21 newly added existing California jail 
jurisdictions) represented by 946 jail facilities (referred to as reporting 
units). This sample represents over 2,800 jail jurisdictions nationwide. 
Local jail jurisdictions include counties (parishes in Louisiana) or 
municipal governments that administer one or more local jails. 

In the adopted design, the over 2,800 jail jurisdictions nationwide were 
grouped into 10 strata. The 10 strata were defined by the crossing of two 
variables: the jail jurisdiction ADP in 2005, and whether in 2005 the 
jurisdiction held at least one juvenile. For 8 of the 10 strata, a random 
sample of jail jurisdictions was selected. For the remaining two strata, all 
jurisdictions were included in the sample. One stratum consisted of all jails 
(70) that were operated jointly by two or more jurisdictions (referred to as 
multi-jurisdictional jails). The other stratum (referred as certainty 
stratum) consisted of all jail jurisdictions (267) that--

* held juvenile inmates at the time of the 2005 Census of Jail Inmates and 
had an average daily population (ADP) of 500 or more inmates during the 12 
months ending June 30, 2005.

* held only adult inmates and had an ADP of 750 or more.

The 2013 ASJ differed from the 2006–2012 ASJs, as the 2013 ASJ included in 
the sample with a probability of one all California jail jurisdictions in 
response to the two enacted laws—AB 109 and AB 117 by the California State 
Legislature and governor—to reduce the number of inmates housed in state 
prisons starting October 1, 2011. The inclusion of all California jail 
jurisdictions resulted in an additional 21 jail jurisdictions (for a total 
sample size of 891 jurisdictions). Since the enactment of the two laws in 
recent years, the California jail population has experienced changes in size 
that cannot be compared to the changes of any other state in the U.S. For 
this reason, the California jail jurisdictions were put in separate strata so 
that they could represent only California jurisdictions. The same sampling 
design was adopted for the California jurisdictions.

BJS obtained data from sampled jail jurisdictions by mailed and web-based 
survey questionnaires. After follow-up phone calls and facsimiles, the 
response rate for data reporters was nearly 100% for critical items, such as 
the number of inmates confined, ADP, and rated capacity. (See tables 10, 11, 
and 12 for standard errors associated with reported estimates from the 2013 
ASJ.)

****************************************
Response rate, nonresponse adjustment, 
and out-of-scope jail facilities
****************************************

The 2013 ASJ sample comprised 946 reporting units. Ninety-one percent (or 
859) of the 941 individual reporting units responded to the 2013 data 
collection, and 82 individual reporting units did not respond to the 
survey.***Footnote * *The sample initially comprised 946 units. However, 5 
units were out-of-scope for the 2013 data collection because they had closed, 
either permanently or temporarily, which resulted in the sample of 941 active
respondents.***

BJS implemented nonresponse weight adjustment procedures to account for unit 
nonresponse, as it did in 2011 and 2012. 

Respondent indicators
**********************

The respondent reporting unit indicator JAILRhij is set for each individual 
reporting unit j in jurisdiction i in stratum h on the file, based on the 
status of the individual reporting unit.

The respondent jurisdiction indicator JURISRhi is set for each jurisdiction i 
in stratum h on the file, based on the value of JAILRhij for the reporting 
units within the jurisdiction.

Active Indicators
*******************

The active reporting unit indicator JAILAhij is set for each individual 
reporting unit j in jurisdiction i in stratum h on the file, based on the 
status of the individual reporting unit. 

The active jurisdiction indicator JURISAhi is set for each jurisdiction i in 
stratum h on the file, based on the value of JAILAhij for the reporting units 
within the jurisdiction.

Nonresponse weighting adjustment factor
******************************************

The nonresponse weighting adjustment factor is calculated within each 
stratum. BJS uses the sample weights in the nonresponse adjustment factor. 
The nonresponse weighting adjustment factor F2h is calculated as

Where

nh = number of jurisdictions sampled in stratum h,

whi = sample weight for jurisdiction i in stratum h.

Final weight
**************

The final weight FWhi for each jail jurisdiction on the 2013 ASJ data file is 
calculated as

where

Whi = sample weight in jurisdiction i in stratum h.

JAILRhi is used to set the final weight to 0 for units that are closed, out-
of-scope, or nonrespondents.

Final weight post-stratification: California 
jail jurisdictions and the Public Safety 
Realignment
*********************************************

Because of the California Public Safety Realignment, between midyear 2011 and 
midyear 2013, California jails experienced a significant increase in the 
number of inmates (about 12,000 inmates) that was not experienced by jails 
nationwide. Consequently, California jails do not represent other jail 
jurisdictions nationwide. To ensure that the sampled California jail 
jurisdictions represent California jurisdictions only, BJS computed new 
weights. Without computing these new weights, the estimated nationwide jail 
population would be erroneously inflated.

The post-stratification final weight adjustment is calculated for each 
stratum from which California jurisdictions were sampled. More specifically 
for each stratum, two new strata and set of weights were created: one for the 
California jurisdictions (PSCAh) and one for the non-California jurisdictions 
(PSCAh). In 2013, all California jail jurisdictions were included in the 
sample; however, not all of them responded.

The weight adjustment for California jail jurisdictions is computed as

where

NCAh = number of California jurisdictions in stratum h,

nCAh = number of sampled California jurisdictions in stratum h

The post-stratification adjustment for non-California jurisdictions is 
computed as

where

NCAh = number of non-California jurisdictions in stratum h, computed as

nCAh = number of sampled non-California jurisdictions in stratum h.

Item nonresponse imputation
******************************

Critical items: Midyear inmate population, 
average daily population (ADP), and 
rated capacity 
-------------------------------------------

Based on the 2013 ASJ, about 99% of the 859 individual reporting units 
provided valid data on their midyear inmate population (853), average daily 
population (847), and rated capacity (849). To calculate a national midyear 
inmate population, ADP, and rated capacity estimate, data were estimated for 
the reporting units that did not report specific data.

Estimates were calculated based on the following criteria:

* Data for 5 individual reporting units included midyear inmate population 
data based on estimates from the 2012 ASJ.

* Data for 1 individual reporting unit included the midyear inmate population 
data based on estimates from the 2011 ASJ.

* Data for 11 individual reporting units included ADP data based on estimates 
from the 2012 ASJ.

* Data for 1 individual reporting unit included the ADP data based on their 
confined population at midyear 2013.

* Data for 7 individual reporting units included rated capacity data based on 
estimates from the 2012 ASJ.

* Data for 3 individual reporting unit included rated capacity data based on 
estimates from the 2011 ASJ.

Inmate characteristics
************************

Based on the 2013 ASJ, more than 90% of the 859 individual reporting units 
provided valid data on sex, age, and race/Hispanic origin. Nearly 91% of 
respondents provided data on inmate conviction status. To calculate a 
national rate for inmate characteristics, data were estimated based on the 
ratio of the reported characteristic population to the total midyear confined 
population. 

Weekly admission and release 
estimation procedures
*****************************

Based on the 2013 ASJ, 847 of the 859 individual reporting units (98%) 
provided valid data on weekly admissions or releases. To calculate an overall 
weekly estimate, data on offender flows through local jails were estimated 
for the 12 reporting units that did not report specific data on admissions 
and releases. Release data were estimated for 3 reporting units that reported 
data on admissions, but not on releases. Nonresponse weight adjustments 
account for the 82 survey nonrespondents.

Estimates were calculated based on the following criteria:

* Data for 1 individual reporting unit included admission and release data 
based on estimates from the 2005 Census of Jail Inmates.

* Data for 1 individual reporting unit included admission and release data 
based on estimates from the 2007 ASJ.

* Data for 4 individual reporting units included admission and release data 
based on estimates from the 2011 ASJ.

* Data for 6 individual reporting units included admission and release data 
based on estimates from the 2012 ASJ.

* Release data for 3 individual reporting units were based on admission data 
reported in 2013.

Calculating annual admissions
******************************

The ASJ collects data on weekly admissions. BJS determined that the June 
admission data from the 2004 Survey of Large Jails (SLJ) were a reliable 
source to calculate a nationwide annual admission estimate. Although the 
number of admissions to jails fluctuated throughout the year, the SLJ tracked 
monthly movements from January 2003 to January 2004 and showed that the June 
2003 count (339,500) closely matched the annual average number of admissions 
(342,956). The number of annual admissions was calculated by multiplying the 
weekly admissions by 366 days and dividing by 7 days.

Calculating weekly turnover rates
**********************************

Weekly jail turnover rates were modeled after the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 
Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Additional information on turnover 
rates is available at http://www.bls.gov/jlt/. Jail turnover rates were 
calculated by adding admissions and releases, and then dividing by the ADP. 
The turnover rate takes into account jail admissions and releases and gives 
an indication of the fluctuation of the jail population.

Jurisdiction size categories
******************************

For the 2011 through 2013 reports, BJS categorized jurisdiction sizes based 
on the ADP during the 12 months ending midyear 2006 (the first year in the 
current ASJ series). For the 2010 report, comparisons of size categories from 
midyear 2009 to midyear 2010 were based on the ADP during the 12 months 
ending midyear 2009. In previous reports (2007 through 2009), the size 
category comparisons were based on the 12 months ending midyear of the 
specific collection year. As a result, not all data in previous reports are 
comparable with data in this report.

Estimating California’s 2012 midyear jail population 
*****************************************************

The ASJ is a sample survey, and data are not representative of individual 
states (except for California starting with the 2013 ASJ). In 2012, data from 
about 70% of California’s jail jurisdictions were included in the 2006–2012 
ASJs. Based on yearend data of California’s jail population collected through 
BJS’s Deaths in Custody Reporting Program, 70% of California’s jail 
jurisdictions included in the ASJ accounted for about 97.5% of all 
California’s jail population in any given year from 2005 to 2011. 

In 2012, to calculate a midyear jail population, BJS applied the proportion 
of the latest yearend non-ASJ sample of California’s jail population to the 
midyear inmate population in the ASJ sample for that year. 

For example: 

ASJ sample of California’s jail population at midyear 2012 = 76,667 
Proportion of the latest non-ASJ sample of California jail population at 
yearend 2011 = 2.5868%.

(76,667 * .025868) + (76,667)= 78,650 estimated midyear jail population.

Jail functions
*****************

Jails in the ASJ include confinement facilities—usually administered by a 
local law enforcement agency—that are intended for adults but may hold 
juveniles before or after they are adjudicated. Facilities include jails and 
city or county correctional centers; special jail facilities, such as medical 
or treatment release centers, halfway houses, and work farms; and temporary 
holding or lockup facilities that are part of the jail’s combined function. 
Inmates sentenced to jail facilities usually have a sentence of 1 year or 
less.

Within the ASJ, jails--

* receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them awaiting trial, 
conviction, or sentencing

* re-admit probation, parole, and bail bond violators and absconders 
temporarily detain juveniles pending their transfer to juvenile authorities

* hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to appropriate mental 
health facilities

* hold individuals for the military, for protective custody, for contempt, 
and for the courts as witnesses

* release convicted inmates to the community upon completion of sentence
transfer inmates to federal, state, or other authorities

* house inmates for federal, state, or other authorities because of crowding 
of their facilities

* sometimes operate community-based programs as alternatives to 
incarceration.

Terms and definitions used in the report
******************************************

Admissions--Persons who are officially booked and housed in jails by formal 
legal document and the authority of the courts or some other official agency. 
Jail admissions include persons sentenced to weekend programs and those who 
are booked into the facility for the first time. Excluded from jail 
admissions are inmates re-entering the facility after an escape, work 
release, medical appointment or treatment facility appointment, and bail and 
court appearances. BJS collects jail admissions for the last 7 days in June.

Average daily population (ADP)--The average is derived by the sum of inmates 
in jail each day for a year, divided by the number of days in the year (i.e., 
between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2013).

Average annual change--The mean average change across a 12-month time period.

Calculating annual admissions--BJS collects the number of jail admissions 
during the last 7 days in June. Annual jail admissions are calculated by 
multiplying weekly admissions by the sum of 365 days divided by 7 days.

Calculating weekly jail turnover rate--This rate is calculated by adding 
admissions and releases and dividing by the average daily population. See 
Calculating weekly turnover rates for additional information.

Inmates confined at midyear--The number of inmates held in custody on the 
last weekday in June.

Jail incarceration rate--The number of inmates held in the custody of local 
jails, per 100,000 U.S. residents. 

Percent of capacity occupied--This percentage is calculated by taking the 
number of inmates (midyear or average daily population), dividing by the 
rated capacity, and multiplying by 100.

Rated capacity--The number of beds or inmates assigned by a rating official 
to a facility, excluding separate temporary holding areas.

Releases--Persons released after a period of confinement (e.g., sentence 
completion, bail or bond releases, other pretrial releases, transfers to 
other jurisdictions, and deaths). Releases include those persons who have 
completed their weekend program and who are leaving the facility for the last 
time. Excluded from jail releases are temporary discharges including work 
release, medical appointment or treatment center, court appearance, furlough, 
day reporting, and transfers to other facilities within the jail’s 
jurisdiction.

Under jail supervision but not confined--This classification includes all 
persons in community-based programs operated by a jail facility. These 
programs include electronic monitoring, house arrest, community service, day 
reporting, and work programs. The classification excludes persons on pretrial 
release and who are not in a community-based program run by the jail, as well 
as persons under supervision of probation, parole or other agencies, inmates 
on weekend programs, and inmates who participate in work release programs and 
return to the jail at night.

Weekend programs--Offenders in these programs are allowed to serve their 
sentences of confinement only on weekends (i.e., Friday to Sunday).
