An estimated 19% of U.S. residents age 16 or older had a
face-to-face contact with a police officer in 2005, a
decrease from 21% of residents who had contact with police in
2002. Contact between police and the public was more common
among males, whites, and younger residents. Overall, about 9
out of 10 persons who had contact with police in 2005 felt
the police acted properly.

Of the 43.5 million persons who had face-to-face contact with
police in 2005, 29% had more than one contact. The most
common reason for contact with police in both 2002 and 2005
involved a driver in a traffic stop. Other frequent reasons
for contact included reporting a crime to police or being
involved in a traffic accident.   

Nearly 18 million persons -- or 41% of all contacts in 2005  
indicated that their most recent contact with police was as 
a driver in a traffic stop. This represented about 8.8% of
drivers in the United States, a percentage unchanged from
2002. Stopped drivers reported speeding as the most common
reason for being pulled over in 2005. Approximately 86% of
stopped drivers felt they were pulled over for a legitimate
reason.

In both 2002 and 2005, white, black, and Hispanic drivers
were stopped by police at similar rates, while blacks and
Hispanics were more likely than whites to be searched by
police. About 5% of all stopped drivers were searched by
police during a traffic stop. Police found evidence of
criminal wrong-doing (such as drugs, illegal weapons, or
other evidence of a possible crime)in 11.6% of searches in
2005.

Police issued tickets to more than half of all stopped
drivers and arrested about 2.4% of drivers. Male drivers were
3 times more likely than female drivers to be arrested, and
black drivers were twice as likely as white drivers to be
arrested. Drivers stopped for speeding (71%) or for a
seatbelt violation (74%) were more likely to be ticketed than
drivers stopped for other reasons, such as an illegal turn or
lane change (58%), a record check (34%), or a vehicle defect
(32%).

Of the 43.5 million persons who had contact with police in
2005, an estimated 1.6% had force used or threatened against
them during their most recent contact, a rate relatively
unchanged from 2002 (1.5%). In both 2002 and 2005, blacks and
Hispanics experienced police use of force at higher rates
than whites. Of persons who had force used against them in
2005, an estimated 83% felt the force was excessive. 

These findings are based on the Police-Public Contact Survey
(PPCS), which documents contacts between police and the
public age 16 or older, including details about the most
recent contact during the year.

Face-to-face contacts with police were more common 
among males, whites, and younger residents

Males (21.1%) were more likely than females (17.2%) to have
contact with police in 2005. Whites (20.2%)experienced 
contact with police officers at higher rates than blacks 
(16.5%) and Hispanics (15.8%). These differences are
consistent with findings from the 2002 PPCS.
 
Whites made up 71% of the U.S. population age 16 or older but
76% of persons who had a police contact in 2005. Black
residents age 16 or older made up about the same percentage
of persons having police contact(10%)as their percentage of
the U.S. population in 2005 (11%). 

In general, younger persons had higher rates of contact with
police than older persons. Persons ages 18 to 24 had the
highest percentage of contact with police (29.3%) in 2005,
while persons 65 or older had the lowest (8.3%). The 2002
survey also found that younger residents were more likely
than older residents to have contact with police.

Among persons age 16 or older with at least one face-to-face
police contact in 2005, the average age was 39. Half of all
residents who had police contact were under 37 (not shown in
table).

43.5 million residents had at least one contact with 
police in 2005

In 2005, 43.5 million persons had at least one contact with
police. An estimated 71.5% had just one contact, 17.5% had
two contacts, and the remaining 11% had 3 or more contacts
with police in 2005. The total number of contacts was 71.1 
million, with an average of 1.6 face-to-face contacts per 
resident.

Teenagers and young adults were twice as likely as older
residents to have multiple contacts with police. An estimated
20% of persons age 55 or older who had contact with police
reported having more than one contact in 2005 (not shown in
table). By comparison, nearly 40% of persons age 16 to 24 
who had contact with police indicated that they had multiple
contacts. 

The most common reason for contact with police was a 
traffic stop

Survey respondents who had face-to-face contact with police
were asked to describe the nature of the contact. Respondents
who had more than one contact with police were asked to
describe only their most recent contact. In both 2002 and
2005, more than half of the contacts with police were the
result of a traffic stop or accident.

The most common reason for contact was as a driver during 
a traffic stop, accounting for about 4 out of 10 contacts.
Traffic accidents accounted for an additional 13% of all
contacts in 2002 and 2005. The second most frequent reason
for contact with police was to report a crime or problem,
accounting for about 1 in every 4 contacts.

Of persons who had contact with police in 2005, 60% indicated
their most recent contact was initiated by the police. The
remaining 40% were self-initiated (not shown in table).

A majority of residents felt the police acted properly 
during face-to-face contact

Of persons who had contact with the police in 2005, about 9
in 10 felt the officer or officers behaved properly. Blacks 
(82.2%) were less likely than whites (91.6%) to feel the 
police acted properly during a contact. Racial differences 
in opinion about police behavior were not found across all 
types of contacts. No differences were found in the 
percentages of whites and blacks who felt the police
behaved properly when helping with a traffic accident or
providing assistance, such as giving directions. Blacks were
less likely than whites to believe law enforcement acted
properly during traffic stops and contacts occurring because
police were investigating a crime or suspected the person of
wrong-doing. 

The likelihood of being stopped by police did not 
change from 2002 to 2005

An estimated 17.8 million persons age 16 or older indicated
that their most recent contact with police in 2005 was as a
driver pulled over in a traffic stop. These drivers
represented 8.8% of the Nation's 203 million drivers. Of
persons who had more than one contact that year and whose
most recent contact was not a traffic stop, an estimated 3
million additional drivers were stopped by police in 2005.
The resulting estimated total number of drivers stopped by
police at least once in 2005 was 21 million (or about 1 in 10
of the Nation's drivers).

Overall, the likelihood of being stopped by police in 2002
and 2005 was about the same. In both years, male drivers were
pulled over at higher rates than female drivers, and younger
drivers were more likely than their older counterparts to be
stopped. Also consistent from 2002 to 2005, white, black, and
Hispanic drivers were stopped by police at similar rates.

Speeding was the reason for more than half of all 
traffic stops

When surveyed drivers were asked what reason the officer gave
for the traffic stop, the most frequent reason was speeding,
cited by more than half (53.3%) of stopped drivers. An 
additional 10.7% of drivers indicated they were stopped for 
a record check of some sort, such as a check of driver's
license, insurance coverage, or vehicle registration. Drivers
were also stopped for vehicle defects, such as a burned out
headlight or a loud muffler (9.6%), violations of stop sign
or stop light (7.2%), an illegal turn or lane change (5.7%),
and seatbelt violations (4.7%). An estimated 2.2% of stopped
drivers indicated they were pulled over during a roadside
check for drunk drivers.

---------------------------------------------
Most stopped drivers (86%) felt they had been
stopped for a legitimate reason

While the majority of stopped drivers felt police had a 
legitimate reason for stopping them, driver opinion was 
not consistent across racial/ethnic categories. White 
(87.6%) and Hispanic drivers (85.1%) were more likely 
than black drivers (76.8%) to feel the stop was legitimate. 

Driver opinion also varied depending on the reason for the 
traffic stop. A smaller percentage of black drivers stopped 
because of a vehicle defect (66.5%) or a record check 
(72.2%) felt they were stopped for a legitimate reason 
compared to white drivers pulled over for the same reasons 
(90.5% and 91.8%, respectively). 

Opinions about the legitimacy of the traffic stop were 
relatively uniform among white, black, and Hispanic drivers 
when the reason for the stop was a roadside check for drunk 
drivers, a seatbelt violation, or an illegal turn or lane 
change.
---------------------------------------------

Police issued tickets to more than half of stopped 
drivers 

As part of the 2005 survey, drivers were asked about the
types of actions police took in order to resolve the traffic
stop. Drivers were asked whether they were: 

* given a verbal warning, the least serious type of police
action resulting from a traffic stop

* issued a written warning, a more serious type of action 
than a verbal warning 

* ticketed, the second most serious type of police action

* arrested, the most serious type of action police could 
take to resolve the traffic stop.

Of the 17.8 million drivers stopped by police in 2005, 17.7%
reported that a verbal warning was the most serious action
taken by police during the traffic stop. An additional 9.1% 
indicated that receiving a written warning was the most 
serious action taken. 

Of the four types of action police could take to resolve the
traffic stop, being ticketed was the most common, reported 
by 57.4% of stopped drivers. An estimated 2.4% of drivers
reported being arrested. For approximately 13.5% of stopped
drivers, no enforcement action was taken, meaning they did
not receive a verbal or written warning nor were they
ticketed or arrested.

The type of action taken by police varied depending on the
reason police gave for making the traffic stop. Drivers
stopped for a vehicle defect (14.9%) were more likely than
speeders (10.1%) to receive a written warning. Speeders
(71.1%) and drivers pulled over for a seatbelt violation
(74.3%) had the greatest likelihood of receiving a ticket
from police. Drivers stopped during a roadside check for
drunk drivers (16.4%) were more likely to be arrested than
drivers stopped for other reasons. Overall, the majority of
drivers stopped during a roadside check (67.8%) indicated
that no enforcement action was taken by police.

-----------------------------------------------
Note regarding findings of apparent disparities

The data in this report are from a survey in which U.S. 
residents were asked about their contacts with police and 
what police did during those contacts. Among other things, 
the report documents the percentage of U.S. residents who 
were pulled over in a traffic stop, and the percentage who 
were ticketed or searched or arrested. In some cases, such 
percentages were found to differ between males and females, 
between older and younger residents, and between the 
different races. For example, blacks were more likely than 
whites to be searched during a traffic stop. 

However, the apparent disparities documented in this report 
do not constitute proof that police treat people differently 
along demographic lines. Any of these disparities might be 
explained by countless other factors and circumstances that 
were not taken into account in the analysis.
-----------------------------------------------

Police took more serious actions during traffic stops
involving males and younger drivers

Male drivers were more likely than female drivers to
experience more serious police actions following a traffic
stop. Males (3.2%) were nearly 3 times more likely than
females (1.1%) to be arrested. Males (59.2%) were also 
more likely than females (54.4%) to be ticketed. 

Police actions taken during a traffic stop were not uniform
across racial and ethnic categories. Black drivers (4.5%)
were twice as likely as white drivers (2.1%) to be arrested
during a traffic stop, while Hispanic drivers (65%) were more
likely than white (56.2%) or black (55.8%) drivers to receive
a ticket. In addition, whites (9.7%) were more likely than
Hispanics (5.9%) to receive a written warning, while whites
(18.6%) were more likely than blacks (13.7%) to be verbally
warned by police.

Younger drivers experienced more serious types of actions 
by police than older drivers:

* Drivers in their twenties (4.8%) were more likely than
drivers in their thirties (1.9%) and forties (1.6%) to be
arrested during a traffic stop.

* Teenage drivers(60.7%)and drivers in their twenties(58.8%)
and thirties (60.8%) were more likely than drivers in their
fifties (52.4%) and drivers age 60 or older(50.4%)to be
ticketed by police during a traffic stop. 

More than half of searches were conducted with the 
consent of the driver

More than half(57.6%)of all searches conducted in 2005 were
by consent. Consent searches occurred because either the
officer asked permission to perform a search and the driver
then granted it, or the driver told the officer he/she could
conduct a search without the officer first asking for
permission. 

The remaining 42.4% of searches occurred without the consent
of the driver. Searches conducted without consent may occur
because: 1) the police officer had not asked permission
before conducting the search; 2) the officer had asked but
the driver refused; or 3) the search was conducted pursuant
to an arrest.

About 1 in 10 searches during a traffic stop uncovered
evidence of a possible crime

In 11.6% of searches conducted during a traffic stop in 2005,
police found drugs, an illegal weapon, open containers of
alcohol, or other illegal items. Consent and nonconsent
searches turned up evidence of criminal wrong-doing at
similar rates.

Rate of police use of force during a traffic stop 
remained stable from 2002 to 2005

Stopped drivers were asked whether, in their opinion, police
had used or threatened to use force against them during the
traffic stop. An estimated 0.8% of the 17.8 million persons
whose most recent contact with police in 2005 was as a driver
in a traffic stop indicated police used or threatened to use
force against them (not shown in table). In 2002, the
percentage was 1.1%.

Percent of persons experiencing force during a police 
contact was about the same in 2002 and 2005

All persons who had contact with police, whether as a driver
in a traffic stop or for some other reason, were asked if the
police officer(s) used or threatened to use physical force
against them during the contact. The survey did not define
force for the respondent. If persons reported more than one
contact that year, they were asked if police used or
threatened force against them during just their most recent
contact.

An estimated 707,520 persons age 16 or older had force used
against them during their most recent contact with police in
2005.***In the report "use of force" includes threat of force 
unless otherwise indicated.*** This estimate is about 1.6% of 
the 43.5 million people reporting face-to-face police contact 
during 2005. The percentage of contacts involving police use 
of force was relatively unchanged from 2002 to 2005.

---------------------------------------------------
The likelihood of being searched during a traffic
stop was unchanged between 2002 and 2005

n both 2002 and 2005, about 5% of stopped drivers were 
searched by police during the traffic stop. The 5% 
includes searches of the vehicle only, the driver only, 
and both the vehicle and the driver.

In both years, male drivers were more likely than female 
drivers to be searched by police during a traffic stop.

In 2005 black (9.5%) and Hispanic (8.8%) motorists stopped 
by police were searched at higher rates than whites (3.6%). 
The likelihood of experiencing a search did not change for 
whites, blacks, or Hispanics from 2002 to 2005.

Drivers under the age of 30 (8.4%) had a greater likelihood 
than drivers age 30 or older (2.7) of being frisked or having 
their vehicle searched. In 2005 drivers in the two youngest 
age categories — teenage drivers (9.5%) and drivers in their 
twenties (8.1%) — were more likely than drivers in their 
thirties (3.3%), forties (3.3%), and fifties (2.3%) to 
experience some type of search.

Due to sample size limitations, analysis could not be done on 
the likelihood of being searched by the reason for the traffic 
stop and gender, race, and age differences. See Appendix for 
more information on sample size on the BJS web site at
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cpp05.htm>
---------------------------------------------------

In the 2005 PPCS all persons were asked if the police used or
threatened to use force against them at any time during the
year. An estimated 991,930 persons reported that they
experienced force or the threat of force by police at least
once in 2005.

Among residents who experienced force, 83% felt it was
excessive  

Most(82.9%)of the 707,520 people experiencing force in 2005
felt the force used by police was excessive. Whites (84.3%)
involved in force incidents were not more likely than blacks
(81.5%) to feel the force was excessive. Among Hispanics who
had force used against them, 85.6% felt it was excessive. 
The differences between estimates for whites, blacks, and
Hispanics were not statistically significant.

Overall, 14.8% of persons who experienced force were injured
during the incident (not shown in table).

The majority (86.9%) of persons involved in police use of
force incidents in 2005 felt the police acted improperly 
(not shown in table). Of those who felt the police acted
improperly, 13.1% said they filed a complaint against the
police. 

Male, black, and younger residents more likely to 
experience force

The differences found among gender, race, and age groups who
experienced force in 2005 were consistent with the 2002 PPCS.
Among the persons who had police contact in 2005, females
(1.0%) were less likely than males(2.2%)to have had contact
with police that resulted in force. Males accounted
for a larger percentage (72.4%) of contacts involving force
compared to their percentage of all contacts (53.6%).

Blacks (4.4%) and Hispanics (2.3%) were more likely than
whites (1.2%) to experience use of force during contact with
police in 2005. Blacks accounted for 1 out of 10 contacts
with police but 1 out of 4 contacts where force was used.

Persons age 16 to 29 (2.8%) who had contact with police were
more likely than those over age 29 (1.0%) to have had force
used against them. Persons age 16 to 29 made up a smaller
percentage of persons who had a police contact (34.5%)
compared to the percentage of persons experiencing force
during a contact(60.3%). The median age of those experiencing 
force was 26.

About 80% of contacts involving force were initiated by
police

Persons whose contact was police-initiated (such as a traffic
stop) were more likely than those whose contact was not
initiated by the police(such as asking police for assistance) 
to experience police use of force (2.2% versus 0.8%)(not 
shown in table). Police-initiated contacts were 60.4% of the 
43.5 million contacts in 2005, but 81.4% of the 707,520 
contacts involving police use of force. 
 
Persons whom police suspected of criminal wrong-doing or who
had contact through a criminal investigation represented a
relatively large percentage of the 707,520 force incidents,
as compared to their representation of all persons with
contact in 2005. Residents suspected of criminal wrong-doing
by police accounted for a percentage of the force incidents
(23.9%) that was nearly 9 times higher than their portion of
all contacts (2.8%). Persons whose contact occurred because 
of a criminal investigation accounted for a percentage of 
force incidents (21.3%), almost 4 times higher than their 
percentage of all contacts (5.6%).

Over half of police use of force incidents involved 
physical force

Residents who experienced force were asked to describe the
type of force used. Among the estimated 707,520 persons who
reported that the police used force against them:

* 55% indicated the police actually used some type of physical
force, such as pushing, pointing a gun, or using chemical
spray

* 27.5% reported force was threatened but not actually 
employed

* 10.1% indicated the officer(s) shouted or cursed at them 
but did not use or threaten physical force.

An estimated 16.8% of persons experiencing force reported that 
they did something to provoke the officer to use force, such 
as threatening the police or resisting arrest.

About half of persons who had force used against 
them were searched by police

In 2005 more than half (54.1%) of those who had force used
against them by police were searched either before or after
the force occurred. Blacks (53.4%) were not more likely than
whites (48.5%) to be searched during contacts that involved
force. Hispanics (71.9%) were more likely than whites (48.5%)
but not more likely than blacks (53.4%) to be searched during
contacts involving force. About 8% of persons who experienced
force reported that police found illegal items (such as
drugs, an open alcohol container, or a weapon) during the
contact (not in a table).

About a third of force incidents resulted in arrest

About 3 in 10 persons who had force used or threatened against 
them in 2005 were arrested during the incident. Less than half 
(41.2%) of persons experiencing force were handcuffed during 
the incident. The higher percentage of persons handcuffed 
versus arrested during force incidents may be an indication 
that police use handcuffs to detain people during contact and 
release them without making an arrest. 

Methodology

The 2005 Police-Public Contact Survey was conducted for the
Bureau of Justice Statistics during the last 6 months of 2005
by the U.S. Census Bureau as a supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The NCVS sample consisted
of 80,237 individuals age 16 or older. About 20% of the NCVS
sample, or 16,294 individuals, were excluded from the 2005
PPCS as noninterviews or as proxy interviews. 

Noninterviews (14,757) included respondents not available for
the interview, those who refused to participate, and non-
English speaking respondents. (Unlike NCVS interviews, PPCS 
interviews are only conducted in English). The remainder
(1,537) were proxy interviews. A proxy interview may be
conducted when a person is unable for physical, mental, or
other reasons to participate. BJS staff determined that proxy
interviewees would have difficulty describing the details of
any contacts between police and the sampled respondent and
decided to exclude them.  

In total, the PPCS interviewed 63,943 persons, which
represents an 80% response rate among eligible individuals
(compared to an overall response rate of 87% for the NCVS).
Among the PPCS interviews, 23,761 (37%) were conducted in
person and 40,182 (63%) by telephone. The PPCS sample in
2005, after adjustment for nonresponse, was weighted to
produce a national estimate of 228,040,117 persons age 16 
or older.

Data collection

Respondents in the 2005 Police-Public Contact Survey were
directly interviewed to determine how many had a face-to-face
contact with police during the previous 12 months. Data on
the number and nature of face-to-face contacts with police
were based solely on the personal accounts of these PPCS
respondents. Official police records on contacts between
police and the public were not used.

Statistical significance

In comparisons indicated in the text, an explicit or implied
difference indicates a test of significance was conducted,
and the difference was significant at the .05 level. Certain
differences were not significant at the .05 level but were
significant at the .10 level. The terms "somewhat," "some
indication" or "slightly" refer to differences significant 
at the .10 level. The report also indicates that some
comparisons were not different, meaning the difference
between the two estimates was not significant at either the
.05 or .10 levels.

Standard errors for the percent of drivers stopped by police
and the percent of persons who experienced force by 
demographic characteristics are provided on page 11. See 
Appendix for other tables available on the BJS web
site at <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cpp05.htm>.

Racial designations

In 1997 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) introduced
new guidelines for the collection and reporting of race and
ethnicity data in government surveys. These methodological
changes were implemented for all demographic surveys as of
January 1, 2003. Individuals after that date were allowed 
to choose more than one racial category. In prior years
individuals were asked to select a single primary race.

In 2005 the racial categories changed from previous Police-
Public Contact Surveys to separately identify residents of 
two or more races. Racial categories presented in this report 
now consist of the following: white only, black only, other 
race only (American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Native 
Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander if only one of these 
races is given), and two or more races (all persons of any 
race indicating two or more races). Because about 0.7%
of survey respondents identified two or more races, the
impact on the rates of police contact for each race is
relatively small.

Prior to 2003, individuals were also asked whether they were
of Hispanic origin before being asked about their race. In
2005 respondents were asked directly if they were Spanish,
Hispanic, or Latino. Individuals who indicated they are of
Hispanic origin are categorized under the heading Hispanic 
or Latino.

Comparing estimates from previous Police-Public Contact
Surveys

The Police-Public Contact Survey has been conducted four
times: 1996, 1999, 2002, and 2005. In this report,
comparisons are exclusively between estimates from the 2002
and the 2005 surveys. See the Appendix for information on 
the reasons for limiting comparisons to these two years 
available on the BJS web site at
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cpp05.htm>.

Comparing estimates from previous Police-Public
Contact Surveys

There are several reasons for limiting comparisons to findings 
from the 2002 and 2005 surveys. Changes were made to the data 
collection instrument following the 1999 survey to reduce the 
overall response burden to survey participants. These changes 
affected estimates of the reason for contact with police, in 
particular the number of drivers stopped. In 1999, respondents 
were asked whether they had been a driver stopped by police at 
any time during the previous 12 months. Any respondent who had 
been pulled over in a traffic stop was then included in the 
count of the number of drivers stopped by police, regardless 
of whether the traffic stop was their most recent contact with 
police. 

In 2002 and 2005, the survey was changed so that respondents 
were asked only about their most recent contact with police 
during the previous 12 months. Respondents whose most recent 
face-to-face contact was not a traffic stop, but who had been 
pulled over by police earlier in the year, were not included 
in the count of the number of drivers stopped. Due to this 
change in the survey, the estimated number of drivers stopped 
by police was smaller in 2002 and 2005 than in 1999. Estimates 
of the characteristics of drivers stopped by police, such as 
the percentage of drivers searched or the reasons drivers 
were stopped, were unaffected by these changes, and remain 
comparable between 1999, 2002, and 2005.

Following the 1999 survey, the measurement of the number of 
drivers in the United States was modified and the estimate 
of the likelihood of being stopped by police in 1999 is not 
directly comparable to estimates in 2002 and 2005. The 
denominator used to calculate the likelihood of being stopped 
by police was "licensed drivers" in 1999, as estimated by the 
U.S. Department of Transportation's 1995 Nationwide Personal 
Transportation Survey. In 2002 and 2005 the denominator was 
"drivers in the United States," as estimated directly from 
responses to additional questions included in the 2002 and the 
2005 Police-Public Contact Surveys. The denominator change was 
made to account for all persons who drive, licensed and not 
licensed, to better approximate the number of persons at risk 
of being stopped by police. Excluded from the new denominator 
were licensed drivers who indicated that they never drive.
