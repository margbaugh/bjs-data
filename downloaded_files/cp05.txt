Highlights

Status of the death penalty, December 31, 2005

* At yearend 2005, 36 States and the Federal prison system 
held 3,254 prisoners under sentence of death, 66 fewer than 
at yearend 2004. This represents the fifth consecutive year 
that the population has decreased.

* Of those under sentence of death, 56% were white, 42% were 
black, and 2% were of other races.

* The 362 Hispanic inmates under sentence of death accounted 
for 13% of inmates with a known ethnicity.

* Fifty-two women were under sentence of death in 2005, up 
from 47 in 1995.

* The 128 inmates received under sentence of death during 
2005 represent the smallest number of admissions since 1973.

* Of the 7,320 people under sentence of death between 1977 
and 2005, 14% were executed, 4% died by causes other than 
execution, and 37% received other dispositions.

* The number of States authorizing lethal injection increased 
from 32 in 1995 to 37 in 2005. In 2005, all of the executions 
were by lethal injection, compared to 88% in 1995.

* Since 1977, 836 of the 1,004 executions (83%) were by lethal 
injection. 
----------------------------------------------------------

Sixteen States executed 60 prisoners during 2005. The number
executed was 1 more than in 2004. Those executed during 2005 
had been under sentence of death an average of 12 years and 
3 months, or 15 months longer than the period for inmates
executed in 2004.

At yearend 2005, 3,254 prisoners were under sentence of death. 
California held the largest number on death row (646), 
followed by Texas (411), Florida (372), and Pennsylvania(218). 
Thirty-seven people were under a Federal death sentence.

During 2005, 24 States and the Federal prison system received
128 prisoners under sentence of death. Admissions in California 
(23), Florida (15), Texas (14), and Alabama (12) accounted for
half of those sentenced to death in 2005.

In 2005, 59 men and 1 woman were executed. The racial/ethnic
distribution of those executed included 38 whites, 19 blacks, 
and 3 Hispanics(all white). All of the executions were carried
out by lethal injection.

From January 1, 1977, to December 31, 2005, 1,004 inmates
were executed by 33 States and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 
Nearly two-thirds of the executions occurred in 5 States: 
Texas (355), Virginia (94), Oklahoma (79), Missouri (66), 
and Florida (60).

Six States revised death penalty 
statutes in 2005

At yearend 2005 the death penalty was authorized by 38 States
and the Federal Government. No State enacted new legislation 
authorizing capital punishment in 2005.

The United States Supreme Court struck a portion of the 
Missouri capital punishment statutes on March 1, 2005(Roper v. 
Simmons, U.S. 125 S.Ct. 1183 (2005)). The Court upheld the 
ruling of the Missouri Supreme Court that imposition of the 
death penalty on persons under age 18 at the time their crimes 
were committed is cruel and unusual punishment and therefore 
prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.

During 2005, 6 States revised statutory provisions relating
to the death penalty. By State, the changes were as follows:

Arizona -- Added four new aggravating factors: murder committed 
to promote a street gang or criminal syndicate; murder with the 
intent to prevent cooperation with law enforcement or to
prevent or retaliate for court testimony; murder committed in
a cold, calculated manner; murder committed by using a "remote 
stun gun" (A.R.S. 13-703 (F)(11-14)), effective 8/12/2005.

Delaware -- Revised its code of criminal procedure to remove 
a requirement that alternate jurors be sequestered until 
conclusion of the guilt phase of capital trials (Del. Code Ann. 
11 4209(b)(1)), effective 7/12/2005.

Nevada -- Revised the capital statute to increase the minimum
age of eligibility for a death sentence from 16 to 18 years 
at the time the offense was committed(NRS 176.025), effective
5/3/2005.

Ohio -- Amended the code of criminal procedure to exempt
mentally retarded persons from capital sentences (O.R.C. 
2929.06(A)) and to allow imposition of the death penalty 
in cases where an appeals court previously vacated a death 
sentence (O.R.C. 2929.06(E)), effective 3/23/2005.

Texas -- Added as an aggravating factor murder of an officer
of the court(Tex. Penal Code 19.03(a)(9)), effective 9/1/2005.

Utah -- Added to the definition of aggravated murder homicide
involving desecration of a dead human body (Utah Code Ann. 
76-5-202(e)) or dismembering, mutilation, or disfiguring of 
the victim's body, either before or after death(76-5-202(s)), 
effective 5/2/2005.

Most States provide for automatic 
review of capital sentences

Of the 38 States with capital statutes at yearend, 37 provided 
for review of all death sentences regardless of the defendant's 
wishes. In South Carolina the defendant had the right to waive
sentence review if he or she was deemed competent by the court 
(State v. Torrence, 473 S.E. 3d 703 (S.C. 1996)). Federal death 
penalty procedures did not provide for automatic review after 
a sentence of death had been imposed.

The State's highest appellate court usually conducted the
review. If either the conviction or sentence was vacated, 
the case could be remanded to the trial court for additional 
proceedings or retrial. As a result of retrial or resentencing, 
a death sentence could be reimposed.

While most of the 37 States authorized automatic review of both 
the conviction and sentence, Idaho, Montana, Oklahoma, South 
Dakota, and Tennessee required review of the sentence only.
In Idaho review of the conviction had to be filed through appeal 
or forfeited. In Indiana and Kentucky, a defendant could waive 
review of the conviction.

In Virginia a defendant could waive an appeal of trial court
error but could not waive review of the death sentence for 
arbitrariness and proportionality. 

In Mississippi the question of whether the defendant could
waive the right to automatic review had not been addressed. 
In Wyoming neither statute nor case law precluded a waiver 
of appeal. 

Arkansas implemented a rule requiring review of specific
issues relating to both capital convictions and sentences 
(Ark. R. App. P. -- Crim 10). Recent case law held waivers of 
this review are not permitted (Newman v. State, No. CR02-811, 
2002 Westlaw 31030906 (Ark. Sept. 12, 2002)). 

Lethal injection was authorized by 
most States with capital statutes

As of December 31, 2005, lethal injection was the predominant
method of execution, authorized by 37 States.

Nine States authorized electrocution; four States, lethal
gas; three States, hanging; and three States, firing squad.

Seventeen States authorized more than 1 method -- lethal
injection and an alternative method –- generally at the 
election of the condemned prisoner. Five of these 17 States 
stipulated which method must be used depending on the date 
of sentencing. One State authorized hanging only if lethal 
injection could not be given. Three States authorized 
alternative methods if lethal injection is ever ruled to be 
unconstitutional: 1 authorized lethal gas, 1 authorized 
electrocution or firing squad, and 1 authorized firing squad.

The method of execution of Federal prisoners is lethal
injection, pursuant to 28 CFR, Part 26. For offenses under 
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 
the method is that of the State in which the conviction 
took place (18 U.S.C. 3596).

Most jurisdictions had set 18 as 
minimum age for capital sentences

As of December 31, 2005, 18 States and the Federal system
required a minimum age of 18 for which the death penalty 
could be imposed.

In some States the minimum age was set forth in the statutory
provisions that determine the age at which a juvenile may be 
transferred to adult court for trial as an adult. While the 
ruling in Roper v. Simmons effectively makes the minimum age 
18 for capital punishment, 14 States had statutes that 
specified an age of eligibility between 14 and 17. 

Six jurisdictions did not specify a minimum age for which the
death penalty could be imposed. 

Number under sentence of death 
declines for fifth straight year

Thirty-six States and the Federal prison system held a total
of 3,254 prisoners under sentence of death on December 31, 
2005, a decrease of 66 since the end of 2004. This was the 
fifth consecutive year that the number of prisoners under a
sentence of death declined, down from 3,601 on December 31, 
2000.

Three States reported 44% of the Nation's death row population: 
California (646), Texas (411), and Florida (372). The Federal 
Bureau of Prisons held 37 inmates at yearend. Of the 39
jurisdictions authorizing the death penalty during 2005, New
Hampshire and Kansas had no one under a capital sentence, and 
New York, South Dakota, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, and
Wyoming had 4 or fewer.

Among the 37 jurisdictions with prisoners under sentence of
death at yearend 2005, 9 had more inmates than a year earlier, 
21 had fewer inmates, and 7 had the same number.

The largest increase occurred in the California (9), followed
by Florida and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (5 each). The 
largest decreases were in Texas (37), Indiana (7), and North 
Carolina and Oklahoma (6 each).

During 2005 the number of white and black inmates under
sentence of death declined (by 51 and 18, respectively). 
The number of persons of other races (including American 
Indians, Asians, and self-identified Hispanics)increased 
from 74 to 77.

Men made up 98% (3,202) of all prisoners under sentence of
death. Whites accounted for 56%; blacks, 42%; and other 
races, 2%. Other races included 31 American Indians, 34
Asians, and 12 persons whose race was unknown. Among those
for whom ethnicity was known, 13% were Hispanic.

52 women on death row at yearend

During 2005 the number of women sentenced to be executed
remained unchanged at 52. Five women were received under 
sentence of death, five were removed from death row, and 1
was executed. Women were under sentence of death in 18 States
and the Federal system. Two-thirds of women on death row at 
yearend were being held in five States: California, Texas,
Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Alabama.

The number of Hispanics under sentence of death declined from
368 to 362 during 2005. Seventeen Hispanics were received under 
sentence of death; 20 were removed from death row; and 3 were 
executed. More than three-quarters of the Hispanics were held 
in 3 States: California (136), Texas (112), and Florida (31).

The gender, race, and Hispanic origin of those under sentence
of death at yearend 2005 were as follows:

Among all inmates under sentence of death for whom date of
arrest was available, half were age 20 to 29 at the time of 
arrest for their capital offense; 11% were age 19 or younger; 
and fewer than 1% were age 55 or older. The average age at
time of arrest was 28 years.

On December 31, 2005, 33% of all inmates were age 30 to 39,
and 61% were age 25 to 44. The youngest offender under 
sentence of death was 20; the oldest was 90.

8% of inmates under sentence of 
death had a prior homicide
conviction

Among inmates under a death sentence on December 31, 2005,
for whom criminal history information was available, 65% had 
prior felony convictions, including 8% with at least one
previous homicide conviction.

Among those for whom legal status at the time of the capital
offense was available, 40% had an active criminal justice 
status. Fewer than half of these were on parole and a quarter 
were on probation. The remaining third had charges pending, 
were incarcerated, had escaped from incarceration, or had some 
other criminal justice status.

Criminal history patterns differed by race and Hispanic origin. 
More blacks (70%) than whites (62%) or Hispanics (61%) had a 
prior felony conviction. About the same percentage of whites
(8%), blacks (9%), and Hispanics (7%) had a prior homicide
conviction. A slightly higher percentage of Hispanics (23%) 
or blacks (17%) than whites (14%) were on parole when 
arrested for their capital offense.

Number of persons sentenced to death 
decreased for third straight year

Between January 1 and December 31, 2005, 24 State prison
systems and the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported receiving 
128 inmates under sentence of death. More than half of the 
inmates were received in 5 jurisdictions: California (23), 
Florida (15), Texas (14), Alabama (12), and Arizona (8).

All 128 prisoners who were received under sentence of death
had been convicted of murder; 5 were female. By race, 70 were 
white and 52 were black. Of the 128 new admissions, 17 were
Hispanic.

The 128 admissions to death row in 2005 marked a decline of
10 from the 138 admissions recorded in 2004, and represented 
the smallest number received in a year since 44 persons were
admitted in 1973 (not shown in table). 

109 persons had their death 
sentences removed or overturned

Twenty-two States and the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported
109 persons whose death sentences were removed or overturned. 
Appeals courts vacated 59 sentences while upholding the
convictions and vacated 8 sentences while overturning the
convictions. Texas reported the largest number of inmates 
whose death sentences were removed(31 removals). Two States 
reported commutations of death sentences: Indiana (2) and 
Virginia (1). 

Thirty-nine inmates in six States had their death sentences
removed because a portion of the statute under which they 
were sentenced was declared unconstitutional.

As of December 31, 2005, 89 of 107 persons who were formerly
under sentence of death were serving a life sentence. One 
inmate had been resentenced to 50 years; two to 45 years; and 
one to 20 years. Two inmates were awaiting a new trial, 11 
were awaiting resentencing, and 1 had no action taken after 
being removed from under sentence of death. The current status 
of two inmates was not available.

25 persons died while under 
sentence of death in 2005

Twenty-one persons under sentence of death died from natural
causes during 2005 -- 6 in California; 3 in Florida; 2 each 
Ohio, Alabama, and Georgia; and 1 each in Arkansas, Louisiana,
North Carolina, Oklahoma, Idaho, and Nevada. Three inmates
committed suicide -- one each in Ohio, Mississippi, and Texas. 
One died in California as the result of a drug overdose.

6,940 persons sentence to 
death since 1977

From 1977, the year after the Supreme Court upheld the
constitutionality of revised State capital punishment laws, 
to 2005, a total of 6,940 persons entered prison under 
sentence of death. During these 29 years, 1,004 persons were 
executed, and 3,062 were removed from under a death
sentence by appellate court decisions and reviews,
commutations, or death.***Footnote 1: An individual may have 
been received and removed from under sentence of death more 
than once. Data are based on the most recent sentence.***

Among individuals who received a death sentence between 1977
and 2005, 3,388 (49%) were white, 2,825 (41%) were black, 611 
(9%) were Hispanic, and 116 (2%) were other races. The 
distribution by race and Hispanic origin of the 4,066 inmates
who were removed from death row between 1977 and 2005 was as 
follows: 2,101 whites (52%), 1,646 blacks (40%), 264 Hispanics
(7%), and 55 persons of other races (1%). Of the 1,004 who
were executed, 584 (58%) were white, 339 (34%) were black, 67 
(7%) were Hispanic, and 14 (1%) were of other races.

60 inmates were executed during 
2005

During 2005 Texas carried out 19 executions; Indiana, Missouri, 
and North Carolina each executed 5 persons; Ohio, Alabama, and 
Oklahoma, 4 persons each; Georgia and South Carolina, 3 each; 
California, 2; and Connecticut, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, 
Maryland, and Mississippi, 1 each. The inmate executed in 
Connecticut was the first execution in that State since 1960.  

Fifty-nine of the inmates executed in 2005 were male and one
was female. Thirty-eight were white; 19 were black; and 3 
were Hispanic.

After the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976,
33 States and the Federal Government executed 1,004 prisoners:

During this 29-year period, 5 States executed 654 prisoners:
Texas (355), Virginia (94), Oklahoma(79), Missouri(66), and 
Florida (60). These States accounted for two-thirds of all
executions. Between 1977 and 2005, 993 men were executed: 
575 were white non-Hispanic; 337, black non-Hispanic; 67, 
Hispanic; 8, American Indian; and 6, Asian. Eleven women 
were executed: 9 white non-Hispanic and 2 black non-Hispanic.

According to data collected by the Federal Government, from
1930 to 2005, 4,863 persons were executed under civil 
authority. Military authorities carried out an additional 160 
executions between 1930 and 1961 (not shown in table).

Between 1977 and 2005, 7,320 prisoners were under death
sentences for varying lengths of time (table 10). The 1,004 
executions accounted for 14% of those under sentence of death. 
A total of 3,062 prisoners (42%) were removed by means other 
than execution. A higher percentage of whites (16%) were 
executed as compared with both blacks and Hispanics (11% each). 
Somewhat larger percentages of blacks (43%) and whites (42%) 
than Hispanics (31%) were removed from under a death sentence 
by means other than execution.

Inmates executed in 2005 had been 
under sentence of death an average 
of 12 years and 3 months

Among all prisoners executed between 1977 and 2005, the
average time between the imposition of the most recent 
sentence received and execution was more than 10 years. White
prisoners had spent an average of 10 years and 3 months, and
black prisoners, 10 years and 11 months.

For the 1,004 prisoners executed between 1977 and 2005, the
most common method of execution was lethal injection (836). 
Other methods used included electrocution (152), lethal gas 
(11), hanging (3), and firing squad (2).

Among prisoners under sentence of death at yearend 2005, the
average time spent in prison was 10 years and 8 months, up 6 
months from that in 2004. The median time between the 
imposition of a death sentence and yearend 2005 was 9 years 
and 10 months.

Overall, the average time for women was 7 years and 6 months,
39 months less than that for men (10 years and 9 months). On 
average, whites, blacks, and Hispanics had spent from 114 to 
132 months under a sentence of death.

----------------------------------------------
Advance count of executions: January 1, 2006-    
December 31, 2006

To provide the latest data on capital punishment, BJS 
gathers information following each execution. The data 
include the date of execution, the jurisdiction, method 
used, and the name, race, and gender of each person 
executed.

During 2006, 14 States had executed 53 inmates, 7 fewer 
than the number executed 2005.

Two States accounted for more than half of the executions 
carried out during this period: Texas performed 24, and 
Ohio executed 5.

Lethal injections accounted for 52 of the executions; 
electrocution, for 1.

Thirty-two of those executed were white and 21 were black. 
No women were executed.

Final counts for 2006 will appear in Capital Punishment 
2006, to be released in late 2007. This annual report will 
consist of data collected from State and Federal correctional 
agencies. The report will cover all persons under sentence 
of death on December 31, 2006, as well as those removed from 
under sentence of death.
-------------------------------------------

Methodology

Capital punishment information is collected annually as part 
of the National Prisoner Statistics program (NPS-8). This data 
series is collected in two parts: data on persons under sentence 
of death are obtained from the department of corrections in 
each jurisdiction currently authorizing capital punishment; 
and information on the status of death penalty statutes is 
obtained from the Office of the Attorney General in each of the 
50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government. 
Data collection forms and more detailed tables are available 
on the BJS website <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cp05.htm>.

NPS-8 covers all persons under sentence of death at any time 
during the year who were held in a State or Federal 
nonmilitary correctional facility. Included are capital 
offenders transferred from prison to mental hospitals and 
those who may have escaped from custody. Excluded are persons 
whose death sentences have been overturned by the court, 
regardless of their current incarceration status.

The statistics reported in this Bulletin may differ from data 
collected by other organizations for a variety of reasons: (1) 
NPS-8 adds inmates to the population under sentence of death 
not at sentencing but at the time they are admitted to a State 
or Federal correctional facility; (2) If inmates entered prison 
under a death sentence or were reported as being relieved of 
a death sentence in one year but the court had acted in the 
previous year, the counts are adjusted to reflect the dates 
of court decisions (see note on table 4 for the affected 
jurisdictions); and (3) NPS counts are always for the last day 
of the calendar year and will differ from counts for more recent 
periods.

All data in this report have been reviewed for accuracy by the 
data providers in each jurisdiction prior to publication.
