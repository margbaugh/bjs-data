According to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), 
victims perceived perpetrators to be gang members in about 
6% of violent victimizations between 1998 and 2003. On 
average for each year, gang members committed about 
373,000 of the 6.6 million violent victimizations. Nonfatal 
violent acts measured include rape/sexual assault, robbery, 
aggravated assault, and simple assault. 

Victims believed that perpetrators were not gang members in 
55% of all nonfatal violent crimes between 1998 and 2003, and 
victims were unsure of gang affiliation in 37%. The 1998-2003 
average is lower than that for the 1993-96 period, when victims 
in about 9% of all violent crimes believed the offenders to have 
been gang members. 

Violence by perceived gang members declined over most of 
the 11-year period, falling from a 1994 peak of about 1.1 
million violent victimizations (5.2 per 1,000 persons age 12 or 
older) to 341,000 (1.4 per 1,000) in 2003. 

Males experienced violence attributed to gang members at 
higher rates than those of females.
                
Hispanic victims of violence identified the offenders as gang 
members at a higher rate than non-Hispanic victims, and 
blacks at a higher rate than whites, for the period between 
1993 and 2003. 
              
Victims believed the offenders were gang members in about 
12% of all aggravated assaults that occurred between 1993 
and 2003. Offenders were identified as gang members in 
about 4% of rapes, 10% of robberies, and 6% of simple 
assaults.
                     
Between 1993 and 2003 younger victims of violence were 
more likely than older victims to believe the perpetrator was a 
gang member. Offenders were perceived to be gang members  
in 12% of violent crimes against those age 12 -19. The 
offender was identified as a gang member in about 6% of 
violent crimes against persons age 20-49 and in about 4% of 
violent crimes against those age 50 or older.

Urban victims were more likely than suburban or rural victims 
to identify offenders as gang members. 
    
Police were as likely to be notified when the victims believed 
the offender not to be a gang member (45% of violence 
reported to the police) as when they believed the offender 
belonged to a gang (47% reported). 

Of the violence that victims believed gang members committed 
between 1993 and 2003, a lone offender accounted for about 
54% and more than one offender, 46%.

According to the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports, each year 
between 1993 and 2003, from 5% to 7% of all homicides and from 8%  
to 10% of homicides committed with a firearm were gang related.
