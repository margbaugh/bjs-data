Capital punishment laws

At yearend 1998 the death penalty was authorized by 38 States
and the Federal Government (tables 1 and 2). During 1998 no
State enacted new legislation authorizing capital punishment.

The New York Court of Appeals struck portions of the New York
death penalty provision in December 1998 (Hynes v. Tomei).  The
affected portions of the statute barred imposition of a death
sentence in cases where a guilty plea was entered by a defendant
while a defendant pleading not guilty would have to stand trial
and face the possibility of a death sentence (CPL 220.10(5)(e)
and 220.30(3)()(vii)).  These provisions were ruled to violate
defendants' fifth amendment right against self-incrimination and
sixth amendment right to a jury trial. 

Statutory changes

During 1998, 13 States revised statutory provisions relating to
the death penalty.  Most of the changes involved additional
aggravating or mitigating circumstances, procedural amendments,
and revisions to capital offenses.

By State, the changes were as follows:

Delaware — Amended an aggravating circumstance to include murder
of a person in retaliation for providing testimony in any court
proceeding (11 Del. c. § 4209(e)(1)g), effective 7/13/98.

Indiana — Added to its penal code as an aggravating factor
killing a pregnant woman (Indiana code 35-20-2-9() (16)),
effective 1/22/98.

Kansas — Revised its penal code to add as a mitigating factor
consideration of whether "a term of imprisonment is sufficient
to defend and protect the people's safety from the defendant,"
(KSA 21-2646), effective 7/1/98.

Kentucky — Revised its penal code to authorize lethal injection
as the method of execution for all inmates sentenced to death on
or after March 31, 1998.  Inmates sentenced prior to that date
must choose between lethal injection and electrocution at least
20 days before the scheduled date of execution; if this option
is waived, the method shall be lethal injection (KRS § 431.220),
effective 3/31/98.

Kentucky also added as a mitigating factor that the victim was a
participant in the criminal actions

(KRS § 532.025(2)()(3)).

Kentucky legislators amended the code of criminal procedure to
establish, upon jury conviction of a defendant, a pre-
sentencing hearing to take place before the jury (KRS §
532.025(1)()).

Another procedural amendment established responsibility of the
Kentucky Supreme Court for automatic review of all death
sentences.  The review includes weighing of all facts and
evidence submitted in the case, determining if aggravating
factors outweigh mitigating factors in the case, and considering
the proportionality of the death sentence compared to similar
cases (KRS § 532.075).

Lawmakers also enacted the Kentucky Racial Justice Act which
prohibits seeking a death sentence against a defendant on the
basis of race and establishes procedures for dealing with claims
made under this act (KRS § 532.300), effective 7/15/98.

Mississippi — Revised its penal code.  The first revision
eliminated lethal gas as an authorized method of execution
(Miss. Code Ann. § 99-19-51), effective 3/18/98.  Lethal
injection is now the sole method of execution authorized in
Mississippi.

Another revision eliminated capital rape from Mississippi's
offense codes.  The statute that created the offense was
rewritten as a statutory rape provision which no longer carries
the death penalty (Miss Code Ann § 97-3-65), effective 7/1/98.

Mississippi amended the code of criminal procedure.  Executions,
which had previously taken place at midnight, will now take
place at 6:00 pm or within 24 hours of the time for which the
death warrant has been signed.  The same statute was also
amended to allow two members of the victim's family to be
present at the execution (Miss. Code Ann. § 99-19-55), effective
7/1/98.

Nebraska — Revised an aggravating circumstance from the
defendant having a substantial history of violent behavior to a
substantial "prior" history (Neb. § 29-2523(1)(a)) and added as
an aggravating circumstance murder of a law enforcement officer
engaged in the performance of official duties where the
defendant had knowledge of the victim's occupation (Neb. §
29-2523(1)(i)), effective 7/15/98.

Ohio — Amended its definition of aggravated murder to eliminate
the condition of specific intent by the defendant to cause death
(O.R.C. § 2903.01), effective 6/30/98.

Ohio lawmakers also revised the mechanism for vacating a death
sentence against a person who was under age 18 at the time of
the offense and for suspending the execution of a pregnant or
insane offender

(O.R.C. § 2929.02), effective 7/29/98.

Pennsylvania — Revised provisions of the capital statute which
specified time limits for transmission of court records to the
governor and issuance of death warrants, terms of confinement
upon receipt of the warrant, persons allowed to witness
executions, and certification and postmortem procedures
following the executions (42 Pa.C.S. § 9711(i), (j), (k), (l),
(m),(n), and (0)), effective 8/17/98.

South Dakota — Amended its code of criminal procedure to
establish a procedure of re-issuance of death warrants that have
expired due to stays granted for appellate review or other
remedial writs issued by the State supreme court (SDCL
23A-27A-31), effective 7/1/98.

Tennessee — Authorized lethal injection as a method of execution
for all persons whose offense occurred on or after January 1,
1999.  Persons who committed offenses prior to that date may
elect lethal injection by requesting in writing a waiver of the
authorized method at the time of their offense (Tenn. Code Ann.
§ 40-23-114(b-e)), effective 5/18/98.

Tennessee legislators expanded the definition of felony murder
to include aggravated child neglect (Tenn. Code Ann. §
39-13-202(a)), effective 5/18/98.

An aggravating factor, murder of a person with a significant
handicap, was revised to specifically include persons 70 years
of age or older (Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-204(i)(14)), effective
7/1/98.

Tennessee revised the code of criminal procedure (Tenn. Code
Ann. § 39-13-204(c)) to allow facts and circumstances regarding
a defendant's prior criminal history of violence to be entered
into evidence by either the prosecution or the defense for
consideration by the jury when weighing aggravating and
mitigating factors, effective 5/7/98, and to allow evidence
concerning the victim and the effect of the crime on the
victim's family to be heard and considered during the sentencing
hearing, effective 7/1/98.

Utah — Revised the code of criminal procedure to  require that a
defendant attain the prior consent of both the prosecutor and
the court in requesting a waiver of a jury in the sentencing
phase of the trial (Utah 76-3-207(1)), effective 5/4/98.

 Virginia — Amended the definition of capital murder to include
the intentional killing of a person under age 14 by a person age
21 or older (Va. Code §  18.2-31(12)), effective 7/1/98.

Washington — Added as aggravating factors murder of a person who
had a protective order filed against the defendant and murder of
a person with whom the defendant shared a household when the
defendant also had a history of 3 or more prior harassment or
criminal assault offenses against the victim (WA ST
10.95.020(13) and (14)).

which method must be used, depending on the date of sentencing;
1 authorized hanging only if lethal injection could not be
given; and if lethal injection is ever ruled unconstitutional, 1
authorized lethal gas, and 1 authorized electrocution. 

The Federal Government authorizes the method of execution under
two different laws.  Offenses prosecuted under 28 CFR, Part 26,
mandate lethal injection, while those prosecuted under the
Violent Crime Control act of 1994 (18 U.S.C. 3596) call for the
method of  the State in which the conviction took place.

Minimum age  

In 1998 eight jurisdictions did not specify a minimum age for
which the death penalty could be imposed (table 4).

In some States the minimum age was set forth in the statutory
provisions that determine the age at which a juvenile may be
transferred to criminal court for trial as an adult.  Fourteen
States and the Federal system required a minimum age of 18. 
Sixteen States indicated an age of eligibility between 14 and 17.

Characteristics of prisoners under sentence of death at yearend
1998

Thirty-seven States and the Federal prison system held a total
of 3,452 prisoners under sentence of death on December 31, 1998,
a gain of 124, or 3.7% more than at the end of 1997 (table 5).  

The Federal prison system count rose from 14 at yearend 1997 to
19 at yearend 1998.  Three States reported 39% of the Nation's
death row population:  California (512), Texas (451),  and
Florida (372).  Of the 39 jurisdictions with statutes
authorizing the death penalty during 1998, New Hampshire had no
one under a capital sentence, and New York, Kansas, South
Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming had 4 or fewer. 

Among the 38 jurisdictions with prisoners under sentence of
death at yearend 1998, 23 had more inmates than a year earlier,
6 had fewer inmates, and 9 had the same number.  California had
an increase of 25, followed by Alabama (19) and Ohio (16). 
Illinois and Virginia had the largest decrease (4 each).

During 1998 the number of black inmates under sentence of death
rose by 78; the number of whites increased by 42; and the number
of persons of other races rose from 56 to 60.

The number of Hispanics sentenced to death rose from 291 to 314
during 1998 (table 6).  Thirty-eight Hispanics were received
under sentence of death, 7 were removed from death row, and 8
were executed.  Four-fifths of the Hispanics were held in 4
States:  California (97), Texas (93), Florida (43), and Arizona
(20).

During 1998 the number of women sentenced to be executed
increased from 44 to 48.  Eight women were  received under
sentence of death, two were removed from death row, and two were
executed.

Women were under sentence of death in 17 States.  Half
of all women on death row at yearend were in California, Texas,
Florida, and Pennsylvania.

Men were 99% (3,404) of all prisoners under sentence of death
(table 7). Whites predominated (55%); blacks comprised 43%; and
other races (1.7%) included 29 American Indians, 18 Asians, and
13 persons of unknown race.  Among those for whom ethnicity was
known, 10% were Hispanic.

The gender, race, and Hispanic origin of those under sentence of
death at yearend 1998 were as follows:

  Hispanic             1             1        2

Among inmates under sentence of death on December 31, 1998, for
whom information on education was available, three-fourths had
either completed high school (38%) or finished 9th, 10th, or
11th grade (38%).  The percentage who had not gone beyond eighth
grade (14%) was larger than that of inmates who had attended
some college (10%).  The median level of education was the 11th
grade.  

Of inmates under a capital sentence and with reported marital
status, more than half had never married; about a fourth were
married at the time of sentencing; and nearly a fourth were
divorced, separated, or widowed.

Among all inmates under sentence of death for whom date of
arrest information was available, half were age 20 to 29 at the
time of arrest for their capital offense; 13% were age 19 or
younger; and less than 1% were age 55 or older (table 8).  The
average age at time of arrest was 28 years.  On December 31,
1998, 37% of all inmates were age 30 to 39, and 69% were age 25
to 44.  The youngest offender under sentence of death was age
18; the oldest was 83.

Entries and removals of persons under sentence of death 

Between January 1 and December 31, 1998, 30 State prison systems
reported receiving 285 prisoners under sentence of death; the
Federal Bureau of Prisons received 5 inmates.  Forty-two percent
of the inmates were received in 4 States: Texas (39), California
(31), and Arkansas and Florida (25 each).  

All 285 prisoners who had been received under sentence of death
had been convicted of murder.  By gender and race, 142 were
white men, 129 were black men, 3 were American Indian men, 2
were Asian men, 1 was a self-identified Hispanic male, 3 were
white women, 3 were black women, and 2 were self-identified
Hispanic women.  Of the 285 new admissions, 36 were Hispanic men
and 2 were Hispanic women.

Twenty-two States reported a total of 80 persons whose sentence
of death was overturned or removed.  Appeals courts vacated 43
sentences while upholding the convictions and vacated 36
sentences while overturning the convictions.  Florida (16 exits)
had the largest number of vacated capital sentences.  Texas
reported one commutation of a death sentence. 

As of December 31, 1998, 48 of the 80 persons who were formerly
under sentence of death were serving a reduced sentence, 15 were
awaiting a new trial, 10 were awaiting resentencing, 1 was
resentenced to time served, and 4 had no action taken after
being removed from under sentence of death.  No information was
available on the current status of two inmates.

In addition, 13 persons died while under sentence of death in
1998.  Ten of these deaths were from natural causes — 3 in
California, 2 each in Illinois and Alabama, and 1 each in
Missouri, Texas, and Nevada.  Two suicides occurred in North
Carolina.  One inmate in Texas was shot during an escape and
subsequently died.

From 1977, the year after the Supreme Court upheld the
constitutionality of revised State capital punishment laws, to
1998, a total of 5,709 persons entered prison under sentence of
death.  During these 22 years, 500 persons were executed, and
2,137 were removed from under a death sentence by appellate
court decisions and reviews, commutations, or death.***Footnote
1: An individual may have been received and re- moved from under
sentence of death more than once.   Data are based on the most
recent sentence.***

Among individuals who received a death sentence between 1977 and
1998, 2,830 (50%) were white, 2,347(41%) were black, 449 (8%)
were Hispanic, and 83 (1%) were  of other races.  The
distribution by race and Hispanic origin of the 2,137 inmates
who were removed from death row between 1977 and 1998 was as
follows:  1,113 whites (52%), 877 blacks (41%), 116 Hispanics
(5%), and 31 persons of other races (2%).  Of the 500 who were
executed, 281 (56%) were white, 178 (36%) were black, 34

(7%) were Hispanic, and 7 (1%) were of other races.


Criminal history of inmates 
under sentence of death in 1998


Among inmates under a death sentence on December 31, 1998,  for
whom criminal history information was available, 65% had
past felony convictions, including 9% with at least one
previous homicide conviction (table 9).  

Among those for whom legal status  at the time of the capital
offense was reported, 40% had an active criminal justice status.
Less than half of these were on parole, and about a fourth were
on probation.  The others had charges pending, were
incarcerated, had escaped from incarceration, or  had some other
criminal justice status.  

Criminal history patterns differed by race and Hispanic origin. 
More blacks (69%) than whites (63%) or Hispanics (61%) had a
prior felony conviction. About the same percentage of blacks
(9%), whites (8%), and Hispanics (8%) had a prior homicide
conviction.  A slightly higher percentage of Hispanics (24%) or
blacks (20%) than whites (15%) were on parole when arrested for
their capital offense.

Since 1988, data have been collected on the number of death
sentences imposed on entering inmates.  Among the 3,169
individuals received under sentence of death during that time,
about 1 in every 7 entered with 2 or more death sentences.

Executions

According to data collected by the Federal Government, from 1930
to 1998, 4,359 persons were executed under civil authority
(table 10).***Footnote 2:  Military authorities carried out
an additional 160 executions, 1930-98. 

After the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, 29
States executed 500 prisoners:

1977            1
1979            2 
1981            1

1996           45
1997           74
1998           68

During this 22-year period, 6 States executed 345 prisoners: 
Texas (164), Virginia (59), Florida (43), Missouri (32),
Louisiana (24), and Georgia (23).  These States accounted for
more than two-thirds of all executions.  Between 1977 and 1998,
278 white non-Hispanic men, 178 black non-Hispanic men, 34
Hispanic men, 4 American Indian men, 3 Asian men, and 3 white
non-Hispanic women were executed.

During 1998 Texas carried out 20 executions; Virginia executed
13 persons; South Carolina, 7; Arizona, Florida, and Oklahoma, 4
each; Missouri and North Carolina, 3 each; and Alabama,
Arkansas, California, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland,
Montana, Nevada, and Washington,  1 each.  Sixty-six persons
executed in 1998 were male and two were female.  Forty were
white; 18 were black;  8 were Hispanic; 1 was American Indian;
and 1 was Asian.

From 1977 to 1998, 6,089 prisoners were under death sentences
for varying lengths of time (table 11). The 500 executions
accounted for 8% of those at risk.  A total
of 2,137 prisoners (35% of those at risk) received other
dispositions.  About the same percentage of whites (9%), blacks
(7%), and Hispanics (7%) were executed.  Somewhat larger
percentages of whites (37%) and blacks (35%) than Hispanics
(25%) were removed from under a death sentence by means other
than execution.

Among prisoners executed from 1977 to 1998, the average time
spent between the imposition of the most recent sentence
received and execution was more than 9 years (table 12).  White
prisoners had spent an average of 9 years, and black prisoners,
10 years and 3 months.  The 68 prisoners executed in 1998 were
under sentence of death an average of 10 years and 10 months.

For the 500 prisoners executed between 1977 and 1998, the most
common method of execution was lethal injection (344).  Other
methods were electrocution (141), lethal gas (10), hanging (3),
and firing squad (2).

The median time between the imposition of a death sentence and
yearend 1998 was 75 months.  Overall, the average time for women
was 6.2 years, slightly less than that for men (7.4 years).  On
average, whites, blacks, and Hispanics had spent from 80 to 92
months under a sentence of death.

Methodology 

Capital punishment information  is collected annually as part of
the National Prisoner Statistics program (NPS-8).  This data
series is collected in two parts:  data on persons under
sentence of death are obtained from the department of correction
in each jurisdiction currently authorizing capital punishment
and are updated annually; information on the status of death
penalty statutes is obtained from the Office of the Attorney
General in each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and
the Federal Government.  Data collection forms and more detailed
tables are available in Correctional Populations in the United
States, published annually.  NPS-8 covers all persons under
sentence of death at any time during the year who were  held in
a State or Federal nonmilitary correctional facility.  Included
are capital offenders transferred from prison to mental
hospitals and those who may have escaped from custody.  Excluded
are persons whose death sentences have been overturned by the
court, regardless of their current incarceration status.

The statistics reported in this Bulletin may differ from data
collected by other organizations for a variety of reasons:  (1)
NPS-8 adds inmates to the number under sentence of death not at
sentencing but at the time they are admitted to a State or
Federal correctional facility.  (2) If in one year inmates
entered prison under a death sentence or were reported as being
relieved of a death sentence but the court had acted in the
previous year, the counts are adjusted to reflect the dates of
court decisions.  (See the note on table 5 for the affected
jurisdictions.)  (3) NPS counts are always for the last day of
the calendar year and will differ from counts for more recent
periods.

All data in this report have been reviewed for accuracy by the
data providers in each jurisdiction prior to publication.
