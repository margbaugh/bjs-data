As of June 2000, American Indian tribes operated 171 law
enforcement agencies that employed the equivalent of at
least 1 full-time sworn officer with general arrest powers. 
In addition, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) operated 37
agencies providing law enforcement services in Indian
country.

Tribally operated agencies employed 3,462 full-time personnel,
including 2,303 sworn (67%) and 1,159 nonsworn (33%). These 
agencies also employed 217 part-time personnel, including 88 
sworn (41%) and 129 nonsworn (59%).

Tribally operated agencies had a combined service population
of 1,016,188 residents in 1999.***Based on the American Indian
“service population” counts published in the BIA 1999 Indian
Labor Force Report. The service population is the total number
of enrolled tribal members and members from other tribes who
live on or near the reservation and are eligible to use the 
tribe's BIA-funded services. The service population probably
underestimates the population served by tribally operated law
enforcement agencies because many agencies serve non-Indian 
residents and other persons using roads, stores, casinos, and 
other public places on trial land.***  This corresponds to 
about 2.3 full-time sworn officers per 1,000 residents, across 
all agencies.

Tribally operated agencies provided a broad range of public
safety services and functions in 2000.  Nearly all (94%)
responded to calls for service, and a large majority engaged 
in crime prevention activities (88%), executed arrest warrants
(88%), performed traffic law enforcement (84%), and served
court papers (76%). 

A majority of agencies provided court security (56%) and search
and rescue operations (53%). About a fourth of agencies operated 
one or more jails. (For more information on jail operations, see 
Jails in Indian Country, 2001, BJS Bulletin, NCJ 193400.)
 
About three-quarters of tribally operated law enforcement agencies 
in 2000 had at least one full-time sworn officer serving in a 
community policing capacity. In some agencies, these officers may 
be known by a title indicative of their community policing approach, 
such as community resource officers and community relations officers. 
A total of 714 officers (or 31% of all full-time sworn officers) 
fulfilled a community policing role in 2000. Among agencies 
employing community policing officers, the average number of such 
officers ranged from 2 for the smallest tribally operated agencies 
to 21 for the largest.

Thirty-seven percent of tribally operated agencies had at least
one full-time sworn school resource officer. These officers'
duties are related to school safety and may include working
closely with school staff to monitor and prevent crime and
disorder problems. In 2000, 162 officers (or 7% of all full-
time sworn officers) served as school resource officers. Among
agencies employing school resource officers, there was an
average of three such officers per agency. 

While tribally operated agencies and other general purpose
police agencies provide a similar range of services, a major
difference between them is the land area served. For example,
the Navajo Nation Department of Law Enforcement covers
approximately 22,000 square miles in 3 States, whereas the
comparably sized Reno, Nevada, Police Department (320 full-
time sworn serving 180,462 residents) covers about 57.5
square miles. In terms of land area, some tribally operated
agencies may be more like county or regional police
departments.

Criminal jurisdiction is another major difference between tribally
operated agencies and their State and local counterparts.
Jurisdiction over offenses in Indian country may lie with Federal,
State, or tribal agencies depending upon the particular offense,
the offender, the victim, and the offense location. (For more
information on tribal jurisdiction, see U.S. Department of
Justice, Indian Country Law Enforcement Review, December
1999; see also Jails in Indian Country, 2001, NCJ 193400). 


-----------------------------------
Crime in Indian country

Law enforcement agencies in Indian country handle a wide range of
offenses. BIA, through its Law Enforcement Services program,
compiles annual statistics submitted by tribally operated and BIA
agencies.  The percentage of those agencies reporting has increased 
in recent years, with 175 of 208 agencies, or 84%, reporting in 
2000.

Crime rates

Agencies in 2000 reported over 9,000 violent crimes, including 8,391
aggravated assaults. Over 15,000 property crimes were also reported.

These offenses represented less than 1% of all violent and property
crimes in the Nation in 2000. In terms of the number of crimes per
100,000 residents, American Indians and Alaska Natives experienced
violence at a higher rate, compared to the country as a whole (656.5
per 100,000 versus 506.1 per 100,000), and property crime at a lower
rate (1,082.8 per 100,000 versus 3,617.9 per 100,000).
  
In particular, the rate of aggravated assault among American Indians
and Alaska Natives in 2000 was roughly twice that of the country as
a whole (600.2 per 100,000 versus 323.6 per 100,000). Victimization
statistics indicate similar findings (see American Indians and Crime,
NCJ 173386, and Violent Victimization and Race, 1993-98, NCJ
176354).

Defining "crime"

The FBI specifies in its Uniform Crime Reporting Program eight Part
I Index crimes:  murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary,
larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson. However, data about these
eight offenses do not completely capture the nature of crime in Indian
country for a variety of reasons.  

*  Many offenses other than Part I offenses can help describe crime
problems.  

For example, tribal agencies reported 13,546 simple assaults and
25,486 incidents of disorderly conduct in 2000. Alcohol-related
offenses were among the most common, including 17,931 liquor law
violations, 19,092 DWI offenses, and 53,297 incidents of drunkenness. 


*  Problems in classifying Part I offenses in Indian country can occur
if these offenses are declined for Federal prosecution. These cases are
returned to tribal justice systems to be treated as lesser offenses 
(tribal courts only handle misdemeanors) and may be recorded as such.

*  Other offenses for which data are not typically collected through the
FBI may hold equal or greater importance for tribal communities.
Tribes may be concerned with particular types of wrongdoing not
captured in Part I offenses.

Improving justice statistics

Many tribal agencies are working to determine what kinds of data need
to be collected, how to collect them, and how to analyze them.
Agencies are seeking tribal personnel with the requisite skills and
training.

BJS and the Tribal Justice Statistics Assistance Center (TJSAC), a
project of the Justice Research and Statistics Association (JRSA) 
with funding from BJS, provide training and technical assistance to
American Indian and Alaska Native tribes to improve the quality and
use of justice statistics.  

The TJSAC does not collect data from tribal justice systems. Rather, 
it provides information and training to help tribes collect and use 
statistics more effectively. More information on TJSAC can be found 
at the TJSAC website <www.tjsac.org>.

Alaska Native (AI/AN) Affairs Desk. The AI/AN Affairs Desk
enhances access to information by Federally recognized American
Indian and Alaska Native tribes regarding funding opportunities,
training and technical assistance, and other relevant information.

Since 1995 the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services
(COPS), U.S. Department of Justice, has awarded more than $198
million to improve law enforcement capabilities in Indian country.
COPS administers several funding programs targeted to tribal law
enforcement agencies, including the Tribal Resource Grant Program,
Comprehensive Indian Resources for Community and Law Enforcement 
(CIRCLE) project, Mental Health and Community Safety Initiative 
for American Indian/Alaskan Native Children, Youth and Families 
(MHCSI), Tribal Hiring Renewal Grant Program (THRGP), and various 
training and technical assistance initiatives including the 3 
Tribes Integrated Justice Pilot Project and Indian Youth Academy.
These initiatives have included funding for new law enforcement
officers, equipment, training, technology, law enforcement
assessments, and youth development.
