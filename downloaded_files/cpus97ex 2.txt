An estimated 5.7 million adult residents of the United States 
were under some form of correctional supervision in 1997.  
Seven in 10 were supervised in the community, through probation 
or parole.  

About 2.8% of all adult residents of the United States were 
under correctional supervision in 1997, up from 1.7% in 1985.  
About 9.0% of black adults, 2.0% of white adults, and 1.3% of 
adults of other races were under correctional supervision in 1997.

The total number of adults in local jails increased by approximately 
47,600 during the year ending June 30, 1997, or 9.3%.  The growth

between 1990 and 1997.

Probation 

Nearly 3.3 million adults were on probation on December 31, 
1997. Probationers made up 57% of all adults under correctional

Twenty-one percent of the probationers were women, a larger 
proportion than for any other correctional population.  About 
64% were white and 34% black. 

Between yearend 1996 and 1997, the number of adults on probation 
increased by 101,841 (3.2%).  From 1990 to 1997 the probation 
population grew by nearly 600,000 people, an average of 2.9% 
annually.

other conditional release violators, up from 29% in 1990.

Around 334,500 sentenced offenders were admitted as new court

Characteristics of State and Federal 
prison inmates

The 1997 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional 
Facilities conducted face-to-face interviews with prison inmates 
from June through October 1997. 

The Surveys obtained detailed information about State and Federal 
prison inmates' current offenses and sentences, their criminal 
histories, personal and family characteristics, drug and alcohol 
use, treatment,  health care, and prison conditions.  State prison 
inmate surveys were also conducted in 1974, 1979, 1986, and 1991.  
Federal inmates were surveyed for the first time in 1991.

During the period that interviews were conducted, 1,409 State 
prisons held 1,059,607 inmates, and 127 Federal prisons held 
89,072 inmates.  Since 1991, when the previous survey was 
conducted, the State and Federal prison population grew by 51%.

The percentage of white, black, and Hispanic State prison inmates 
remained relatively unchanged between 1991 and 1997.  Thirty-three 
percent of State inmates were white non-Hispanic, 47% black non-
Hispanic, and 17% Hispanic.  The percentage of black inmates in 
Federal prison increased from 30% in 1991 to 38% in 1997.  

The State prison population grew increasingly middle-aged between 
1991 and 1997. In 1991 inmates between age 35 to 44 comprised 23% 
of the population, the same group accounted for 29% in 1997.  The 
median age increased from 30 years in 1991 to 32 years in 1997.  
The median age of Federal prisoners remained unchanged at 36 years.
Just under half of inmates in State prison were incarcerated for a 
violent offense in both 1991 and 1997.  The percentage of property 
offenders dropped from 25% in 1991 to 22% in 1997, while public-order 
offenses increased from 7% to 10% during the same period.  In both 
years about 2 in 10 State inmates were incarcerated for a drug offense.  

The percentage of inmates held for a drug offense in Federal 
prison continued to rise, from 58% in 1991 to 63% in 1997.  
Nearly half were drug trafficking offenders.

Just under half of all inmates in State prison and a quarter of 
those in Federal prison were on probation or parole at the time 
of their current arrest.  The percentage of recidivists among State 
prisoners, those with a prior sentence to probation or incarceration, 
declined from 81% in 1991 to 76% in 1997.  Nearly 43% of State 
inmates said they had three or more prior sentences.

At the time of the offense, just over half of State inmates in 1997, 
and a third of Federal inmates were under the influence of either 
alcohol or drugs.  Among State inmates, 37% were under the influence 
of alcohol, and 33% were under the influence of drugs.  Among Federal 
inmates, 20% were drinking and 22% were using drugs.

Reported drug use by State and Federal prison inmates increased 
between 1991 and 1997.  Nearly 57% of State inmates were using 
drugs in the month before the offense, up from 50% in 1991.  Drug 
use among Federal inmates increased from 32% in 1991 to 45% in 1997.

Overall, the percentage of inmates who reported receiving drug 
treatment and programs since admission to State prison declined 
from 30% in 1991 to 24% in 1997.  Among federal prisoners, 25% 
reported participation in drug treatment or programs in 1997, up 
from 20% in 1991.

Among those who used drugs regularly in the month before the 
offense, 35% of State prisoners and 40% of Federal inmates in 1997 
had participated in a drug treatment or drug abuse program since 
admission.

Prior to admission to prison, 57% of female State prison inmates and 
16% of males said they had been physically or sexually abused.  Lower 
rates of abuse were reported by Federal inmates, 7% of males and 40% of
females reported prior abuse.
