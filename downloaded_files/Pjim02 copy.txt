Highlights
              
In the year ending June 30, 2002 --

*   The Nation's prison and jail population exceeded 2 million 
inmates for the first time.

*  The number of inmates held in local jails rose by 34,235; 
in State prison rose by 12,440; and in Federal prison by 
8,042.

*  In the largest State prison systems, the total number of 
inmates declined: Texas (down 6,334), California (down 3,650), 
and New York (down 2,027). 

At midyear 2002 --

*  A total of 3,055 State prisoners were under age 18. Adult 
jails held a total of 7,248 persons under age 18.

*  State and Federal correctional authorities held 88,776 
noncitizens, up from 87,917 (1.0%) at midyear 2001.

*  There were 113 female inmates per 100,000 women in the United 
States, compared to 1,309 male inmates per 100,000 men.

*  An estimated 12% of black males, 4% of Hispanic males, and 
1.6% of white males in their twenties and early thirties were 
in prison or jail.

*  Local jails were operating 7% below their rated capacity. In 
contrast, at yearend 2001 State prisons were operating between 
1% and 16% above capacity, and Federal prisons were 31% above 
their rated capacity.

*  Privately operated prison facilities held 86,626 inmates (down 
6.1% since yearend 2001). Texas reported the largest drop (from 
16,331 to 10,764)among inmates in private prisons.
--------------------------------------------------------
              
At midyear 2002 the Nation's prisons and jails incarcerated 
2,021,223 persons. Prisoners in the custody of the 50 States, 
the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government accounted 
for two-thirds of the incarcerated population (1,355,748 
inmates). The other third were held in local jails (665,475).

On June 30, 2002, 1,426,118 prisoners were under Federal and 
State jurisdiction, which includes inmates in custody and 
persons under the legal authority of a prison system but held
outside its facilities. During the 12-month period ending June 
30, 2002, the number under State jurisdiction rose by 0.9%, 
while the number under Federal jurisdiction rose by 5.8%. Rhode 
Island (up 17.4%), New Mexico (up 11.1%), and West Virginia and 
Maine (both up 8.7%) had the largest percentage increases. Nine 
States had decreases, including Illinois (-5.5%), Texas (-3.9%), 
and New York (-2.9%).

At midyear 2002 local jail authorities held or supervised 737,912 
offenders.  Ten percent of these offenders (72,437) were supervised 
outside jail facilities in programs such as community service, work 
release, weekend reporting, electronic monitoring, and other 
alternative programs.

Prison and jail population exceeds 2 million
inmates for the first time 

On June 30, 2002, 1,355,748 inmates were in the custody of State and 
Federal prison authorities, and 665,475 inmates were in the custody 
of local jail authorities. In the first 6 months of 2002, the
Nation's prison population increased 24,521 (1.9%). This increase 
offset the decline of 4,039 inmates (-0.3%) during the last 6 months 
of 2001. These data were collected in the 2002 National Prisoner 
Statistics program and the 2002 Annual Survey of Jails. (See 
Methodology, page 11, for a description of data collections.) 

Since midyear 2001 the total incarcerated population has increased 
2.8%. Including inmates in public and privately operated facilities, 
the number of inmates in State prisons increased 1.0%; in Federal 
prisons, 5.7%; and in local jails, 5.4%. At midyear 2002, Federal 
prisons (including all secure and non-secure public and private
facilities) held 7.7% of all inmates, up from 5.6% in 1995. 

Between 1995 and midyear 2002, the incarcerated population grew 
an average of 3.8% annually. During this period the Federal and 
State prison populations and the local jail population grew at 
the average annual rates of 8.1%, 3.0%, and 4.3%, respectively.

In the 12 months before midyear 2002, the number of inmates in 
prison and jail rose an estimated 55,287 inmates, or 1,063 
inmates per week. 

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail in 2002 was 702 
inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents up from 690 at midyear 2001. 
At midyear 2002, 1 in every 142 U.S. residents were in prison or 
jail.

State prison population increases in first 6
months of 2002 after a decline in the last 6
months of 2001 

Between July 1 and December 31, 2001, the number of prisoners 
under State jurisdiction dropped -0.3%, decreasing by 3,217 
inmates.  In the first 6 months of 2002, however, the number
of prisoners rose 1.2% (increasing by 14,911 inmates). The net 
gain in the jurisdiction count for the 12-month period was 
11,694 (representing a 0.9% growth since June 30, 2001). 

Since 1995 the Federal system has grown at a higher rate than 
the States, peaking at 6% growth in the first 6 months of 1999. 
During this time, growth rates for States and the Federal system
have been consistently larger in the first half of each year than 
in the second half. In the first 6 months of 2002, the number of 
Federal inmates increased 3.0% (more than twice the rate of State
growth for the same period) but at a pace significantly lower 
than rates recorded in the first half of each year since 1995.

In absolute numbers, the total increase of 20,587 State and Federal 
prison inmates between July 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002, was about 
half the annual average growth (41,984) since 1995.

Over 40% of prisoner growth from Federal
system

Over 40% of the growth in the Nation's prison population during the 
12 months ending June 30, 2002, was accounted for by the Federal 
system (8,893 additional inmates). During this period, responsibility 
for housing sentenced felons in the District of Columbia was 
transferred to the Federal system. At yearend 2001, when the transfer 
was completed, the Federal system held 6,930 inmates from the District 
of Columbia, up from 4,486 on June 30, 2001. More than a quarter
of the growth in the Federal system in the 12 months ending June 30, 
2002, was the result of this transfer of responsibility.  

During this 12-month period, several States also experienced substantial
growth, including Rhode Island (17.4%), New Mexico (11.1%), and West
Virginia and Maine (each 8.7%). Nine States, including several large 
States, experienced a decline in their prison population. Illinois had 
the largest percentage decrease (-5.5%), followed by Texas (-3.9%), New 
York (-2.9%), Delaware (-2.3%), and California (-2.2%).

--------------------------------------------
Prison incarceration rates continue to rise

The incarceration rate of State and Federal prisoners sentenced 
to more than 1 year was 474 per 100,000 U.S. residents on June 
30, 2002, up from 472 per 100,000 on June 30, 2001. The rates 
since 2001 reflect the impact of shifting to the 2000 decennial 
census population estimates.  Midyear incarceration rates prior 
to 2001 were based on estimates from the 1990 Census of
Population and Housing. Using estimates from the 2000 Census, 
the revised incarceration rate for midyear 2000 was 470 sentenced 
prisoners per 100,000.  

Twelve States led by Louisiana (799 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 
State residents), Mississippi (728), and Texas (685), exceeded the
national rate. Three States -- Maine (137), Minnesota (139), and North 
Dakota (167) -- had rates that were less than a third of the national
rate. The District of Columbia, a totally urban jurisdiction, held 55
sentenced prisoners per 100,000 District residents at midyear 2002, 
a significant drop following the transfer of responsibility for 
sentenced felons to the Federal system.

Since 1995 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000 residents has 
risen from 411 to 474. During this period prison incarceration rates 
rose the most in the Midwest (from 310 to 371) and West (from 358 to 
413). The rate in the South rose from 483 to 531, and the rate in the
Northeast rose slightly from 301 to 303. The number of sentenced 
Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents increased from 32 to 49
over the same period.

Private facilities held fewer inmates at midyear
2002 

In the first 6 months of 2002, the number of prisoners held in privately
operated facilities dropped from 91,953 to 86,626, a decrease of 6.1%. 
The drop was mainly due to the decline in inmates held in private 
facilities for Texas authorities (from 16,331 at yearend 2001 to 10,764 
at midyear 2002). Overall, private facilities held 6.1% of all State and
Federal inmates, down from 6.8% at midyear 2001. 

The Federal system (20,293), Texas (10,764), and Oklahoma (6,773) reported 
the largest number of inmates in private facilities at midyear 2002. Five
States -- New Mexico (43%), Montana (31%), Alaska (29%), Oklahoma (29%),
and Wyoming (28%) -- had at least a quarter of their prisoners in private
facilities.  
--------------------------------------------

Female inmate population rose at a faster rate
than male inmate population in last 12-month
period  

From July 1, 2001, to June 30, 2002, the number of women under the
jurisdiction of State and Federal prison authorities grew from 94,336 
to 96,099, an increase of 1.9%. The number of men rose 1.4%, from 
1,311,195 to 1,330,019. At midyear 2001 California, Texas, and the 
Federal system housed nearly 4 of every 10 female inmates.

Since 1995 the annual rate of growth in the number of female inmates 
has averaged 5.4%, higher than the 3.6% average increase of male
inmates. Women accounted for 6.7% of all inmates at midyear 2002, up 
from 6.1% at yearend 1995.

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident population, men were 
about 15 times more likely than women to be incarcerated in a State 
or Federal prison. On June 30, 2002, the rate for inmates serving a 
sentence of more than 1 year was 60 female inmates per 100,000 women 
in the United States, compared to 902 sentenced male inmates per 
100,000 men.

Number of State inmates under age 18
continues to decline

A total of 3,055 State prisoners were under age 18 on June 30, 2002, 
down from 3,147 at midyear 2001. At midyear 2002, 112 were female, 
2,943 were male. Overall, fewer than 0.5% of all prisoners were under 
age 18.

Eleven States reported more than 100 prisoners under age 18 at midyear 
2002,led by Connecticut (366), Florida (306), Texas (230), New York 
(210), and North Carolina (200). Three of these States reported a 
decline in their populations during the 12 months ending June 30, 
2002 -- Florida (down 22.5%), New York (down 17.3%), and North Carolina 
(down 5.7%). Michigan reported the largest increase (up 100%), followed 
by California (up 17.9%).

Three States (Kentucky, Montana, and West Virginia) had no inmates under 
age 18 at midyear 2002. Twelve other States reported 10 or fewer inmates 
under age 18.

At midyear 2002, 62% of noncitizen prisoners
held in State facilities; 38% in Federal facilities

On June 30, 2002, 88,776 noncitizens were in the custody of State or 
Federal correctional authorities, up from 87,917 at midyear 2001.
Overall, 6.9% of State and Federal inmates at midyear 2002 were not U.S.
citizens.

At midyear 2002, 33,873 Federal inmates were noncitizens, representing 
25% of all Federal prisoners. California (19,418), New York (8,306),
Texas (8,002), Florida (4,526), and Arizona (3,412) held over 80% of 
all noncitizen State prisoners. Noncitizen prisoners  accounted for
over 10% of the prison populations of California, New York, Arizona, 
and Nevada.

Since midyear 1999, there has been little change in the number of 
noncitizens held in State and Federal prisons. In the year ending June 
30, 2002, the number of noncitizens held in the Federal system declined 
(13 inmates), while the number in State prisons rose (872 inmates). 
(For an analysis of the Federal system, see Immigration Offenders in the
Federal Criminal Justice System, 2000, NCJ 191745.)

Growth slows as rising State prison releases
outpace admissions

Underlying the decrease in the rate of growth since 1995 in State prison
populations has been a rise in prison releases. During 2001, 591,837
sentenced prisoners were released from State prisons, up from 544,864 
in 1999 -- an increase of 8.6%. At the same time, total admissions to
State prison rose 3.3% (from 575,415 in 1999 to 594,429 in 2001).

Admissions to the Federal prison system increased 7.5% between 1999 and 
2001 (41,972 to 45,140); releases increased 20.6% (31,816 to 38,370). 
Although releases rose faster than admissions, the number of admissions 
to Federal prison in 2001 exceeded releases by more than 6,700 inmates.

Overall, State prison release rates dropped from 37 per 100 inmates in 
1990 to 31 per 100 in 1995 and then remained nearly unchanged (reaching
33 per 100 in 2001). However, as a result of increasing total prison
populations, the absolute number of releases increased 30% (from 455,139
in 1995 to 591,837 in 2001).

Prior to 1998 growth in prison admissions reflected increasing numbers 
of offenders returning for parole violations. Between 1990 and 1998, 
the number of returned parole violators increased 54% (from 133,870 to
206,152), while the number of new court commitments increased 7% (from 
323,069 to 347,270). The number of parole violators returned to prison 
in 2001 totaled 215,450; the number of new court commitments, 365,714. 
(See Trends in State Parole, 1990-2000, NCJ 184735.)

At midyear the Nation's jails supervised 
737,912 persons

As defined in this report, jails are locally operated correctional 
facilities that confine persons before or after adjudication. Inmates
sentenced to jail usually have a sentence of 1 year or less, but jails
also incarcerate persons in a wide variety of other categories. 
(See box below.) 

Based on the 2002 Annual Survey of Jails, the Nation's local jails held 
or supervised 737,912 offenders on June 28, 2002. Jail authorities
supervised 10% of these offenders (72,437) in alternative programs outside 
the jail facilities. A total of 665,475 persons were housed in local
jails.

------------------------------------
Jails --

*  receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them awaiting 
trial, conviction, or sentencing

*  readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and absconders

*  temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to juvenile 
authorities

*  hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to appropriate 
health facilities

*  hold individuals for the military, for protective custody, for 
contempt, and for the courts as witnesses

*  release convicted inmates to the community upon completion of 
sentence

*  transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other authorities

*  house inmates for Federal, State, or other authorities because of 
crowding of their facilities

*  sometimes operate community- based programs as alternatives to
incarceration

*  hold inmates sentenced to short terms (generally under 1 year).
----------------------------------------

Among persons under community supervision by jail staff in 2002, 19% were
required to perform community service (13,918) and nearly 25% participated 
in a weekend reporting program (17,955). Thirteen percent of offenders 
in the community were under electronic monitoring; 12% were under other
pretrial supervision; 2% were in a drug, alcohol, mental health, or other 
type of medical treatment program; and 7% were in a work release or other
alternative work program.

Number of jail inmates rose 34,200 in 12
months ending June 28, 2002 

Between July 1, 2001, and June 28, 2002, the number of persons held in 
local jail facilities grew 5.4% - from 631,240 to 665,475. The 12-month
increase was above the average growth (4.0%)from midyear 1995 to midyear 
2002. The 5.4% growth in 2002 was the largest annual increase since 1997. 
In absolute numbers, the total increase of 34,235 inmates in 2002 was 
greater than the increase in 2001 (10,091).

Jail incarceration rates rose sharply in last
12-month period

Since 1990 the Nation's jail population on a per capita basis has 
increased over 40%. During this period the number of jail inmates 
per 100,000 residents rose from 163 to 231. 

When offenders under community supervision by jail authorities are 
included with those in custody, the rate was 257 offenders per 100,000 
U.S. residents at midyear 2002. 

An estimated total of 7,248 persons under age 18 were housed in adult 
jails on June 28, 2002. Eighty-four percent of these young inmates had
been convicted or were being held for trial as adults in criminal court. 
The average daily population for the year ending June 30, 2002, was
652,082, an increase of 4.2% from 2001 and 27.9% from 1995.

Characteristics of jail inmates
changing slowly

Male inmates made up 88.4% of the local jail inmate population at midyear 
2002 - 1.4 percentage points lower than at midyear 1995. During the 12-
month period ending June 28,2002, the number of adult female inmates rose
5.8%, while the number of adult male inmates increased 5.5%. On average 
the adult female jail population has grown 5.9% annually since 1995,
while the adult male inmate population has grown 3.8%. 

At midyear 2002 nearly 6 in 10 persons in local jail inmates were racial 
or ethnic minorities.  Whites made up 43.8% of the jail population; 
blacks 39.8%; Hispanics, 14.7%; and other races (Asians, American 
Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders), 
1.6%.

On a per capita basis, men were nearly 8 times more likely than women to 
have been held in a local jail on June 28, 2002. Blacks were 5 times
more likely than whites, nearly 3 times more likely than Hispanics, and 
over 10 times more likely than persons of other races to have been in 
jail.

On June 28, 2002, about 60% of the Nation's adult jail inmates were 
awaiting court action on their current charge. An estimated 264,000 
adults held in local jails were serving a sentence in jail, awaiting
sentencing, or serving time for a probation or parole violation.  As 
a percent of all jail inmates, the percent convicted has dropped from 
44.0% at midyear 2000 to 40.1% at midyear
2002.

At midyear 2002, 93% of jail capacity occupied

In the 12 months ending June 28, 2002, fewer beds than inmates were 
added to the Nation's jails, for the first time since 1997. At midyear 
2002 the rated capacity of the Nation's local jails was estimated at 
713,899 beds, an increase of 14,590 in 12 months. 

Rated capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates allocated by 
State or local rating officials to each jail facility. The growth in 
jail capacity during the 12-month period ending on June 28, 2002, 
(14,590) was considerably less than the average growth of 24,019 
beds every 12 months since midyear 1995, and was less than the growth 
in beds during 2001 (21,522). 

As of June 28, 2002, 93% of the local jail capacity was occupied.
**On December 31, 2001, State prisons were operating between 101% 
and 116% of capacity, while Federal prisons were operating at 31% 
above capacity.  See Prisoners in 2001, July 2002, NCJ 195189.**  
As a ratio of all inmates housed in jail facilities to total 
capacity, the percentage occupied decreased by 11 percentage points 
from 1990 to 2002. At midyear 1990 local jails operated at 4% above 
their rated capacity.

Jail jurisdictions that on average held between 500-999 inmates again 
reported the highest occupancy rates.  At midyear 2002 occupancy
was 95% of rated capacity in jail jurisdictions with an average daily
population of 1,000 or more inmates, compared to 68% in those with 
fewer than 50 inmates.

The 50 largest jail jurisdictions housed a third
of all jail inmates 

On June 28, 2002, the Nation's 50 largest jail jurisdictions held 31.5%
(209,847) of all jail inmates. Twenty States had at least one
jurisdiction which ranked in the top 50 for average daily population. 
States with more than one jurisdiction among the Nation's 50 largest
jurisdictions are California (11), Florida (7), Texas (7), Georgia (3), 
Ohio (3), Pennsylvania (3), Tennessee (2), and New Jersey (2).

The two jurisdictions with the most inmates, Los Angeles County and New 
York City, together held approximately 34,100 inmates, or 5% of the
national total. 

Nineteen jurisdictions among the 50 largest experienced a decrease in 
the number of inmates held between July 1, 2001, and June 28, 2002. 
Jurisdictions with the largest decreases were Fulton County, Georgia 
(down 15.1%), Milwaukee County, Wisconsin (down 12.5%), De Kalb County,
Georgia (down 12%), Orange County, Florida (down 11.1%), and Kern 
County, California (down 10.8%).

The jurisdiction with the largest increase in jail population was 
Riverside County, California (up 17.6%).  Other jail jurisdictions 
with substantial population increases were Oklahoma County,
Oklahoma (up 17.3%), Harris County, Texas (up 15.4%), Maricopa County, 
Arizona (up 13.9%), and Orange County, California (up 13.1%).  
Seventeen of the 50 largest jail jurisdictions operated at over 100% 
of their rated capacity. On June 28, 2002, Clark County, Nevada, 
operated at 166% of their capacity; Maricopa County, Arizona, operated 
at 152%; and Philadelphia City, Pennsylvania, operated at 132% of 
capacity.

An estimated 12% of black males in their twenties and 
early thirties in prison or jail in 2002

When total incarceration rates are estimated separately by age group, 
black males in their twenties and thirties are found to have high 
rates relative to other groups. Among the more than 2 million offenders
incarcerated on June 30, 2002, an estimated 596,400 were black males 
between ages 20 and 39.

Among males age 25 to 29, 12.9% of blacks were in prison or jail, 
compared to 4.3% of Hispanics and about 1.6% of whites. 

Although incarceration rates drop with age, the percentage of black 
males age 45 to 54 in prison or jail in 2002 was an estimated 3.9% -- 
more than twice the highest rate (1.7%) among white males (age 30 to 
34).

Female incarceration rates, though significantly lower than male rates 
at every age, reveal similar racial and ethnic differences. Black females
(with a prison and jail rate of 349 per 100,000) were 21/2 times more 
likely than Hispanic females (137 per 100,000) and 5 times more likely 
than white females (68 per 100,000) to be incarcerated in 2002. These
differences among white, black, and Hispanic females were consistent 
across all age groups.

Among black females, the rate was highest (1,024 per 100,000) among 
those age 30 to 34. This rate was nearly 5 times higher than the rate 
among white females in this age group (213 per
100,000).

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics (NPS)

The Bureau of Justice Statistics, with the U.S. Census Bureau as its
collection agent, obtains yearend and midyear counts of prisoners 
from departments of correction in each of the 50 States, the District 
of Columbia, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  

NPS distinguishes between prisoners in custody from those under 
jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a State must hold that 
person in one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction, a State has 
legal authority over the prisoner. Prisoners under a State's 
jurisdiction may be in the custody of a local jail, another State's 
prison, or other correctional facility such as a privately operated
institution. Some States are unable to provide both custody and 
jurisdiction counts.  

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in locally administered
confinement facilities who are under the jurisdiction of local 
authorities.  NPS counts include all inmates in State-operated facilities 
in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, 
which have combined jail-prison systems. (See National Prisoner Statistics
jurisdiction notes, on the BJS Web site.)

Annual Survey of Jails, 2002

In each of the years between the full censuses, a sample survey of 
jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the Nation's 
jails and the inmates housed in these jails. Based on information 
from the 1999 Census of Jails, a sample of jail jurisdictions was 
selected for the 2002 survey. A jurisdiction is a county (parish in
Louisiana) or municipal government that administers one or more local 
jails. The sample included all jail facilities (948) in 878 
jurisdictions.

In drawing the sample, all multi-jurisdictional (47) jails were included 
in the sample with certainty. These jails are operated jointly by two 
or more jurisdictions. Other jurisdictions (357) were included 
automatically in the sample if their jails held juvenile inmates on 
census day and had an average daily population of 250 or more inmates,
or if their jails held only adults and had an average daily population 
of 500 or more. 

The remaining jurisdictions were stratified into two groups: 
jurisdictions with jails holding at least one juvenile on June 30, 
1999, and jurisdictions with jails holding adults only. Using 
stratified probability sampling, 474 jurisdictions were then selected 
from 10 strata based on the average daily population in the 1999 
census.

Data were obtained by mailed and web-based
survey questionnaires.

After follow-up phone calls to respondents, the response rate for the 
survey was 100% for critical items such as rated capacity, average 
daily population, and number of inmates confined. (For standard errors,
