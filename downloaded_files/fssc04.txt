In 2004 State courts convicted an estimated 1,079,000 adults
of a felony, a number about 24% higher than the 872,000 
adults convicted in 1994. About a third of convicted felons 
were drug offenders, and about 1 in 5 were violent offenders. 
Overall, between 1994 and 2004 the number of felons convicted 
of a violent offense in State courts rose 18% (from 165,000 
to 195,000).  

During this 10-year period, the conviction rate for violent
crimes also rose. For every 100 persons arrested for a violent 
felony in 1994, an estimated 23 were convicted. In 2004, the 
rate was 31 persons convicted for every 100 persons arrested.

Persons convicted of a felony were most likely to receive an
incarceration sentence in 2004. Forty percent were sentenced 
to a period of confinement in State prison and 30% in local 
jail. An estimated 28% of convicted felons were sentenced to 
probation with no jail or prison time.

The average sentence length to State prison for a violent
felony declined between 1994 and 2004(from 10 years to 71/2 
years). However, felons sentenced for a violent felony in 
2004 were more likely than those sentenced in 1994 to serve 
a larger proportion of their sentence before release.

Among major findings on State court sentencing in 2004--  

* 94% of felony convictions occurred in State courts, the
remaining 6% in Federal courts.

* 95% of convicted felons pleaded guilty, the remaining 5% 
were found guilty by a jury or judge.

* The average sentence length for convicted felons to State
prison was almost 5 years.

* Females accounted for a quarter of felony property 
offenders.

The findings in this report were almost exclusively based 
on the National Judicial Reporting Program, a survey that 
is conducted every 2 years and collects the only detailed 
information on sentences of convicted felons in State 
courts nationwide. Detailed data are available in State 
Court Sentencing of Convicted Felons, 2004 -- Statistical 
Tables, located on the BJS web site at
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/scscfst.htm>.

About 1.1 million persons were convicted of a felony in 
State courts in 2004

In 2004 an estimated 1,078,920 persons were convicted of a
felony in State courts, a vast majority (95%) of whom pleaded 
guilty. The 1.1 million persons were convicted and sentenced 
for about 1.5 million felony offenses during 2004. At 
the time of sentencing, about 3 out of 4 felons sentenced in 
2004 (77%) were sentenced for a single felony. The rest were
sentenced for two or more felonies. A drug crime was the most 
serious conviction offense for about a third of felons 
convicted in 2004.

Majority of felony convictions occurred in State courts

Federal courts convicted 66,518 persons of a felony in 2004,
which represented 6% of the combined State and Federal total 
convictions.

Violent offenses comprised 18% of felony convictions in State
courts, compared to 4% of those in Federal courts. Weapons 
offenses accounted for 12% of felony convictions in Federal 
courts, compared to 3% of those in State courts. 

Average age of convicted felons was 32 years

In 2004 persons in their twenties accounted for 40% of
convicted felons, which was double their percentage of the 
adult population (18%). The average age of persons convicted 
of a felony in State courts in 2004 was 32 years. Men
accounted for a larger percentage of persons convicted of a
felony (82%), compared to their percentage of the adult 
population (49%). Whites were 82% of adults in the U.S. 
population, compared to 59% of persons convicted of a
felony. Blacks were 12% of the adult population, but 38% of
convicted felons. 

Females accounted for a quarter of felony property 
offenders

Females comprised a relatively large proportion of persons
convicted of a property crime in 2004--1 in 4--compared to 
their proportion of those convicted of other crimes. Persons 
under 30 accounted for 48% of felony convictions for property 
offenses, but 61% of felony weapon convictions.

7 in 10 convicted felons in State courts were sentenced 
to incarceration

In 2004, 70% of all persons convicted of a felony in State
courts were sentenced to a period of confinement--40% to 
State prison and 30% to local jail. In some cases the 
incarceration sentences also included a term of probation 
supervision. Persons convicted of a violent felony (78%) 
were most likely to receive an incarceration sentence in 
2004. An estimated 28% of convicted felons were sentenced to 
probation with no jail or prison time. Two percent of felons 
were not sentenced to any incarceration or probation but
received a sentence that included fines, restitution,
treatment, community service, or some other penalty (for 
example, house arrest or periodic drug testing).

Prison sentences in State courts averaged almost 5 
years in 2004

State prison sentences averaged 4 years and 9 months in 2004.
Persons convicted of a violent felony received the longest 
prison sentences in 2004. Felony sentences to jail averaged 
6 months. The average felony sentence to incarceration(prison 
or jail) in State courts was about 3 years in 2004, compared 
to just over 5 years in Federal courts. Federal felony drug 
offenders received incarceration terms (7 years) that were 
about 21/2 times the length of felony drug offenders in State 
courts (2 years and 7 months). 

Among felons who were sentenced in State courts to probation
and no incarceration, the average probation sentence was 3 
years and 2 months.

Less than 1% of convicted felons were sentenced to 
life in prison

Life sentences are rare among convicted felons in State courts, 
whether measured as a percentage of all sentences(0.3%)or as 
a percentage of prison sentences (0.8%). Among the estimated 
8,400 persons convicted of murder or nonnegligent manslaughter 
in 2004, 20.4% were sentenced to life in prison.

In 2004, 29 States received 115 prisoners under sentence of 
death.***Footnote: See Capital Punishment, 2004, NCJ 211349, 
November 2005.***  Not all 8,400 persons convicted of murder 
or nonnegligent manslaughter were subject to the death 
penalty. Twelve States did not authorize the death penalty 
in 2004. In the 38 States that did, only certain types of 
murder were capital offenses.

Trends in convictions and sentences for violent 
felonies

The likelihood of arrest leading to conviction for a violent 
crime has increased

In 2004 aggravated assault convictions in State courts totaled 
94,380, and adult arrests for that crime totaled 377,580, 
indicating about a 25% likelihood of conviction for aggravated 
assault. The corresponding rate in 1994 was 14%. The robbery 
conviction rate also rose between 1994 (39%) and 2004 (46%). 
The overall conviction rate for violent felonies-—murder, rape, 
robbery, and aggravated assault-—increased from 23% in 1994 to 
31% in 2004.

Violent offenders were sentenced to shorter prison terms 
but served a larger percentage of their sentence

The estimated average prison sentence received by violent 
felony offenders in State courts decreased from nearly 10 
years in 1994 to about 7½ years in 2004. During this period, 
the fraction of their court-imposed sentence actually served 
in prison increased from just under half to about two-thirds. 
As a result, the average time served in prison for a violent 
felony remained relatively stable between 1994 and 2004.

Methodology

The National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP) has been 
conducted every two years since 1986. The 2004 survey was 
based on a nationally representative stratified cluster 
sample of State courts from 300 counties. Case-level data 
were successfully obtained on 471,645 convicted felons 
from these 300 counties. The NJRP excluded misdemeanors 
and Federal court convictions.

error tables and detail on methodology are available
