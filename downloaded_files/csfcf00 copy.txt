Census of State and Federal 
Correctional Facilities, 2000

On June 30, 2000, the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
conducted a census of the Nation's correctional 
facilities that operated under State or Federal 
authority. These Federal and State facilities, 
together with private facilities operating under 
contract to government authorities, included places of 
confinement such as prisons, prison hospitals, prison 
farms, boot camps, and centers for reception, 
classification, or alcohol and drug treatment; and 
community-based facilities such as halfway houses, 
group homes, and work release centers.  

Facilities were included in the census if they housed 
primarily State or Federal prisoners; were physically, 
functionally, and administratively separate from other
facilities; and were operational on the day of the 
census. 

Jails and other local or regional detention facilities 
were specifically excluded from the census, as were 
private facilities not holding predominantly State or 
Federal inmates. Also excluded were facilities for the 
military, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Bureau 
of Indian Affairs, U.S. Marshals Service, and correctional 
hospital wards not operated by correctional authorities.

Number of facilities
*  The number of adult correctional facilties increased 
14%,from 1,464 at midyear 1995, when the previous census
was conducted, to 1,668 at midyear 2000. The total number 
of facilities in 1995, previously reported as 1,500, was 
revised as the result of a change in the classification 
of Federal facilities. 

*  In 2000, 84 Federal facilities were in operation, 9% 
more than in 1995; 1,320 State facilities, 3% more than 
in 1995; and 264 private facilities, 140% more than in 
1995. Privately owned or operated facilities with 50% or 
more of their inmates held for State or Federal authorities 
were classified as prisons. Other private facilities were 
classified as jails and included in the Census of Jails,
last conducted in 1999.

Capacity
*  The maximum number of beds or inmates assigned by a 
rating official, known as rated capacity, expanded 31%,
from 975,719 in 1995 to 1,278,471 in 2000. 

*  On June 30, 2000, State prisons were operating at 1% 
above their rated capacity, down from 4% over capacity in
1995. The Federal prison system was operating at 34% over 
capacity at midyear 2000, up from 25% over capacity in 
1995.

Facility characteristics 
*  Confinement facilities -- institutions in which less 
than 50% of the residents are regularly permitted to 
leave, unaccompanied by staff, for work, study, or 
rehabilitation -- declined from 79% of all correctional 
facilities in 1995 to 72% in 2000. Community-based 
facilities  - institutions in which 50% or more of the
residents are regularly permitted to leave -- increased 
from 21% to 28% of the total.

*  More than a third of the 460 community-based facilities 
in 2000 were privately operated.

*  About half of all facilities were rated as minimum or 
low security, a third as medium security, and a fifth as 
maximum security at midyear 2000, unchanged from 1995.

*  Most of the maximum security facilities in 2000 were 
State operated facilities (317of 332). Eleven were Federal 
facilities and 4 were private.

*  Of the 204 adult correctional facilities added between 
1995 and 2000, three quarters (154) were private facilities.  
Nearly two-thirds of these private facilities (94) were 
minimum or low security; more than half (82) were community 
based.

*  Nearly 1 in every 6 State facilities and 1 of every 2 
private facilities held fewer than 100 inmates. No Federal 
facilities had fewer than 100 prisoners.

*  Overall, 241 facilities had an average daily population 
of 1,500 or more during the 12 months ending June 30, 2000. 
States operated most of these facilities (208), while the 
Federal system operated 23 and private contractors 10.

*  Between 1995 and 2000 State facilities grew larger, as 
the number of facilities with average daily populations of 
750 or larger increased from 442 to 547 and the number with 
fewer than 750 declined from 835 to 773.

Characteristics of inmates
*  The number of inmates held in Federal, State, and 
private correctional facilities rose 28% between midyear 
1995 and 2000, an average annual growth rate of 5.0%. The 
population held in private facilities, though small in 
number, increased the fastest (up 459%), followed by the 
Federal (37%), and State populations (19%).

*  Between 1995 and 2000 the number of inmates who were not 
U.S. citizens rose by approximately two-thirds in both
Federal and State facilities. In 2000 non-U.S. citizens 
accounted for 25% of the Federal, 5% of the State, and 12% 
of the private correctional populations.  

*  The number of inmates under the age of 18 dropped 23%, 
from 5,309 in 1995 to 4,095.  Almost all of these inmates 
(96%)were held in State facilities.  None were in Federal 
facilities.
    
*  Nearly 1 in every 5 inmates was classified as a maximum 
security risk, 2 in 5 as medium security, and 2 in 5 as
minimum security or unclassified in 2000, unchanged from 
1995. 

*  State facilities had the largest percent of inmates 
classified as maximum security (21%), followed by Federal
facilities (11%), and private facilities (4%). Federal 
facilities had the largest percent classified as minimum 
(61%), followed by private facilities (48%) and State 
facilities (33%). 

Number of correctional employees 
*  A total of 430,033 correctional staff were employed 
throughout the Nation on June 30, 2000, 24% more than 
5 years earlier.
 
*  Staff growth between 1995 and 2000 was highest among  
private facilities (364%), followed by Federal (32%), 
and State institutions (18%).

*  Correctional officers and other custody and security 
staff accounted for 38% of the Federal, 65% of State, 
and 60% of the private correctional workforces.

*  Between 1995 and 2000 the inmate population grew 
slightly faster than the number of correctional employees. 
As a result, the number of inmates per employee rose from 
2.9 to 3.0.

*  The average number of inmates per correctional officer 
increased from 4.6 in 1995 to 4.8 in 2000.

Characteristics of correctional staff
*  The number of female employees increased 41% between 
1995 and 2000, while the number of male employees
increased 17%. Women made up 33% of all staff in 2000, 
up from 29% in 1995.

*  24% of correctional officers and other custody staff 
in 2000 were women. In 5 years their number increased 
53% from 41,857 to 64,095.   

*  Approximately 69% of correctional facility workers in 
2000 were white, 21% were black, 8% were Hispanic, and 2%
were of other races. In 1995 the percentage of white 
employees was slightly higher (71%), and the percentages 
of Hispanic (6%) and black employees (20%) were slightly 
lower.

Prisoner assaults
*  Facilities reported more than 34,000 inmate-on-inmate 
assaults and nearly 18,000 inmate-on-staff assaults in 
the 12-month period preceding the 2000 Census. The number 
of assaults, including both physical and sexual assaults, 
was higher than in a similar period preceding the 1995 
Census.

*  Although the number of reported assaults rose, the 
rate of inmate assault declined from 14.8 per 1,000 
inmates in 1995 to 14.6 per 1,000 in 2000.

*  In the 12-months preceding the 2000 Census, 53 inmates 
died as a result of an inmate assault, down from 82 in the 
same period in 1995. Five staff died from inmate assaults, 
down from 14 in 1995.

Data collection and processing for the 2000 Census of 
State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities were 
carried out by Pam Butler and Linda Huang, with 
assistance from Patricia Torreyson, and Bill Bryner, 
under the supervision of Charlene Sebold, Governments 
Division, U.S. Census Bureau.

The 2000 Census of State and Federal
Correctional Facilities 
counted 1,668 facilities in operation on June 30,
2000

Number of facilities  The total number of Federal,
State and Private correctional facilities increased
14% from midyear 1995 when the count stood at
1,464. (Prior to the reclassification of Federal
facilities between 1995 and 2000, Bureau of
Justice Statistics publications reported a total of
1,500 correctional facilities in operation in 1995.)

Private facilities grew the most, increasing 140%
from 110 to 264, followed by a 9% gain by
Federal facilities, from 77 to 84, and a 3%
increase by State facilities from 1,277 to 1,320. 

The number of community-based facilities rose
51% from 304 in 1995 to 460 in 2000, while
confinement institutions gained 4% from 1,160 to
1,208. 
 
Population  A total of 1,305,253 inmates were in
custody in State, Federal and private correctional
facilities on June 30, 2000, 28% more than in
1995.

There were 464 prison inmates per 100,000 U.S.
residents at midyear 2000, up from 390 per
100,000 in 1995.

Men made up 93% of the correctional population
and women, 7%. Between 1995 and 2000 the
number of male inmates rose by 27%, and female
inmates, by 38%.

Type of facility  About 95 of every 100 inmates in
2000 were held in confinement institutions where
less than half the population was permitted to
regularly leave the premises unaccompanied by
staff.

Approximately 5 of every 100 inmates resided in
community-based facilities where half or more of
the inmates were permitted to regularly leave
unaccompanied.

More than three-quarters of facilities operated by
State authorities

Facilities  State correctional authorities operated
1,298 facilities in 2000, or 78% of the total.
Private operators under contract to State or
Federal authorities operated 264 facilities (16%);
Federal authorities,  84 (5%); and States and
localities as joint authorities, 22 (1%). 

More than four-fifths of confinement facilities
functioned with State employees, and about a
third of community-based facilities were privately
operated.

Prisoners  Approximately 84% of all prisoners
were held in facilities operated by State
authorities; 9% were held in institutions operated
by Federal authorities; 7% by private operators;
and less than 1% under joint arrangements
between State and local authorities.   

About 85% of confinement facility prisoners were
incarcerated in State-run institutions, and 25% of
community-based inmates were housed in facilities 
operated by private contractors. 

Facility and inmate growth highest among 
private facilities

Jurisdictions  Between 1995 and 2000, the number of 
private prisons increased from 110 to 264 -- up 140%.  
The number of Federal prisons increased from 77 to 
84 (up 9%), and State prisons increased from 1,277 to 
1,320 (up 3%). 

Though private prisons held a relatively small 
proportion of all inmates (7% in 2000) they
reported the largest percentage growth -- up
459% in 5 years.  The Federal prison population
rose 37%, and the State population rose 19%. 

Regions  Almost half of all State prisons and
over two-fifths of State inmates were in the
South. Its 743 State correctional facilities were
more than twice as numerous as those of other
regions. With nearly 519,000 prisoners, its
population was more than double that in both the
Northeast and the Midwest, and nearly double
that in the West. 

The South also had the largest number of prisoners per 
100,000 State residents (518); the Northeast had the 
lowest number (321).

Black and Hispanic inmates in the 
majority 

Approximately 46% of all prison inmates
(excluding those whose race was not reported)
were black; 36%, white; 16%, Hispanic; 1%,
American Indian or Alaska Native; and 1%, Asian
or Pacific Islander. 

Federal  Black inmates comprised the largest
category (40%), followed by Hispanic (30%),
white non-Hispanic (27%), American Indian or
Alaska Native, (over 1%), and Asian or Pacific
Islander, 1%.

State  47% of inmates were black; 37% were
white; 14%, Hispanic; 1%, American Indian or
Alaska Native; and less than 1%, Asian or Pacific
Islander.

Private  The largest category was black (42%),
followed by white (32%); Hispanic (22%);
American Indian or Alaska Native (2%); and
Asian or Pacific Islander (2%).  

Average daily population in prison 
reached nearly 1.3 million -- up 30% 
from 5 years earlier
                        
Jurisdiction  The average daily population (ADP) in
Federal institutions was 108,529, about 36% more
than during the annual period ending June 30, 1995
(table 5). Among State facilities ADP was 1,090,176,
up 22%; and among private facilities it was 91,184,
a rise of 455% over the number in 1995.

Region  The West, with an average daily population of 
267,392, recorded the highest 5-year growth of any 
region (36%). The Northeast, with an ADP of 173,139, 
recorded the lowest 5-year growth (18%).

Prison facilities operated at 2% above 
rated capacity in 2000 
 
Federal facilities   With 110,974 inmates housed
in space rated for 83,113, the Federal system
operated, overall, at 134% of capacity occupied,
higher than both the State and private systems.
The smallest Federal facilities, housing between
100 and 249 inmates, had the lowest occupancy
-- 89%; and facilities with capacities of 750 to
1,499, where more than half of the Federal
prisoners resided, had the highest occupancy --
144%.

State facilities  The number of inmates held in
State facilities exceeded rated capacity by fewer
than 11,000 inmates, producing an overall rate of
101% of capacity occupied. Facilities with a rated
capacity for fewer than 100 beds had the lowest
occupancy (84%); and large institutions holding
1,500 to 2,499 inmates had the highest (109%). 

Private facilities   With an overall rate of 89% of
capacity occupied, private contract facilities had
more space relative to inmates than either the
Federal or the State systems. The smallest
private facilities (less than 100 inmate capacity)
had the lowest occupancy (84%); and the largest
institutions (1,500 to 2,499 inmate capacity) had
the highest occupancy (99%). 
 
A quarter of all prison facilities held between 
750 and 1,499 inmates     

A total of 421 facilities were medium-sized,
holding between 750 and 1,499 inmates.
Together with 360 facilities housing between 250
and 749 inmates, they accounted for 47% of the
Nation's prison beds on June 30, 2000.

The other half of all facilities included those
holding fewer than 100 inmates, 21%; those
holding between 100 and 249 inmates, 17%;
those holding between 1,500 and 2,499 inmates,
11%; and those holding 2,500 inmates or more, 4%.

Jurisdiction  Eighty-five percent of Federal
facilities were either medium-sized (750 - 1,499)
or large (1,500 - 2,499), with 14% of its inmates in
smaller structures. Only one Federal facility held
more than 2,500 inmates.

State facilities were the most equally distributed
in size: 17% of State facilities held fewer than 100
inmates; 18% held 100 to 249; 23% held 250 to 749; 
26% held 750 to 1,499; 11% held 1,500 - 2,499; and 
5% held 2,500 or more.

Half of all private facilities held fewer than 100
inmates. The remainder included 16% with a capacity 
for 100 to 249 inmates, and 34% with a capacity for 
250 inmates or more.

Region  Compared with other regions, the West had a 
significantly higher percentage of facilities housing 
fewer than 100 inmates (37%) and 2,500 inmates or more 
(12%).  

Among confinement facilities the predominant
facility function was general population
confinement; among community-based facilities
it was work release, prerelease, or community
corrections 
   
Confinement facilities  General population
confinement was a function of all except two
Federal facilities, 90% of State confinement
facilities, and 79% of private confinement
facilities. Alcohol or drug treatment was a
function in 20% of the private, 19% of the
Federal, and 16% of the State confinement
facilities.  

Community-based facilities  Work release,
prerelease, or community corrections was a
function in 93% of the State and 91% of the
private community-based facilities. About 19% of
the State facilities and 16% of the private
facilities also provided general population
confinement. Approximately 17% of private
facilities reported alcohol or drug treatment
functions. 

More than a quarter of correctional facilities less 
than 10 years old

Facilities  Approximately 27% of all prison
facilities were less than 10 years old, including
32% in the Federal system, and 30% in the South. 
About 1 in every 20 facilities, nation-wide, were
100 years old or older, including about 1 in 10 in
the Northeast.

Inmates  Approximately 31% of all prisoners
(nearly 403,000 inmates) were housed in facilities
that were less than 10 years old; 56% in facilities
that were less than 20 years old.  Approximately
80,000 prisoners (6%) resided in structures 100
years old or older. The South had the largest
percentage of inmates in facilities less than 10
years old (37%), and the Midwest had the largest
percentage in facilities 100 years old or older
(14%).

More than a quarter of all confinement 
facilities maximum security prisons

On June 30, 2000, 332 of the 1,208 confinement
facilities (27%) were classified as maximum
security prisons, including those designated as
super maximum, maximum, close, and high.
There were 506 medium security confinement
facilities (42%) and 370 minimum and low
security facilities (31%).

Gender of inmates housed  More than 8 of every
10 confinement facilities housed men only;
facilities housing women only and facilities
holding both, men and women each accounted
for fewer than 1 out of every 10 confinement
facilities. The distribution was similar among
maximum, medium, and minimum security
institutions.
 
Function  General population confinement was
most common in medium security facilities
(94%), followed by maximum security (92%) and
minimum security detention (81%). Medical
treatment or hospitalization was reported most
frequently in maximum security prisons (20%)
and least frequently in minimum security
facilities (5%). By contrast, alcohol or drug
treatment functions were reported most often in
minimum security (22%), and least often in
maximum security facilities (11%).  

Age  Approximately three-fifths of both maximum
and medium security prisons were less than 20
years old, compared to slightly less than half of
all minimum security facilities. Ten percent of
maximum security prisons were 100 years old or
older, compared to 3% of medium and 2% of
minimum security prisons. 

Size  Over half of the largest facilities (those with
an average daily population of 2,500 or more)were 
maximum security prisons. Nearly two-thirds of the 
smallest facilities (those with fewer than 249 inmates) 
were minimum/low security facilities. 

More than a third of confined inmates in maximum
security facilities Of the more than 1.2 million 
inmates in confinement facilities on June 30, 2000, 
nearly 36% were held in maximum security facilities;
48% in medium security facilities and 16% in minimum/
low security facilities. 

Gender of inmates housed  Approximately 9 of
every 10 inmates in confinement facilities were
incarcerated in facilities for men only. The
remainder were about equally divided between
institutions housing women only and those
housing both men and women.   
                         
Age of facility  Nearly half of minimum security
inmates, over half of maximum security, and
nearly two-thirds of medium security inmates
were held in facilities built in the previous 20
years.  Overall, 6% of inmates were held in
facilities built at least 100 years ago.  Two-thirds
of these inmates (51,937) were in maximum
security facilities.

Size of facility  Over 50% of inmates held in
maximum and medium security facilities,
compared to 21% of inmates held in minimum
security facilities, were in facilities with an
average daily population of 1,500 or more.  
 
State inmates nearly twice as likely as Federal
inmates to be rated at the maximum custody level

Within correctional facilities, inmates may be
held at differing custody levels, based on the
level of restriction and their need for supervision.
At midyear 2000, 21% of State inmates, 11% of
Federal inmates, and 4% of inmates in private
facilities were held in maximum/close/high
custody. Overall, nearly 245,000 inmates were
being held in maximum custody. 

Confinement  About two-fifths of State confinement
facility inmates were classified as medium security,
a third as minimum security, and a fifth as maximum
security. By contrast, Federal confinement facility
inmates were significantly more likely to be classified
as minimum security (61%), and less likely to be
medium (27%) or maximum (11%). Private
confinement facility inmates were the least likely to
be maximum security (4%) and the most likely to be
minimum security (48%).

Community  More than three-quarters of all
inmates housed in State and private
community-based facilities were classified as
minimum security. Fewer than 1% of inmates in
State run community-based facilities were held in
maximum security.

3,175 inmates died in Federal, State, 
and private prisons between July 1, 1999, 
and June 30, 2000

Federal, State, and private correctional authorities
reported that 3,175 inmates had died during the
12-month period ending June 30, 2000, down from
3,311 reported in the same length period in 1995.
Relative to the number of inmates, the rate of death
dropped from 3.2 per 1,000 inmates in 1995 to 2.4 in
2000.

Illnesses or natural cause was the principal
cause of death among all inmates, including 85%
in Federal, 75% in State, and 66% in private
facilities.  Acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS) was the second most frequent cause,
accounting for 13% in private, 10% in State, and
7% in Federal facilities. The remaining deaths
included suicide (5% to 9%), homicide (1% to
3%), and other causes, that is, executions,
accidents, and drug overdoses (1% to 9%).  

The number of noncitizen inmates nearly doubled
from 1995 to 2000

A total of 95,043 inmates or approximately 7% of all
State and Federal prisoners were not U.S. citizens.
In 1995, a total of  51,500 State and Federal inmates
(5%) were noncitizens.

Nearly 25% of Federal prisoners were non-U.S.
citizens, compared to about 5% of State
prisoners and 12% of inmates in private prisons.
All but one Federal facility, over half of all State
facilities, and a quarter of private facilities held 
at least one noncitizen. 

4,095 prisoners under age 18 in 2000, 
down from 5,309 in 1995

A total of 4,095 inmates in adult correctional
facilities on June 30, 2000, were under age 18,
accounting for approximately three-tenths of one
percent of all inmates.  

Of all inmates under age 18 at midyear 2000,
State facilities held 3,927, and private facilities
held 168. None were held in Federal facilities. A
third of all State prisons (435) housed an inmate
under the age of 18.

About 1 in 5 correctional facilities operated
under a court order or consent decree

On June 30, 2000, a total of 357 facilities (21%)
were under State or Federal court orders for the
totality of conditions, to limit population, or for
specific conditions of confinement. In 1995, 456
facilities (31%) had similar court directives. The
2000 total included 324 State operated facilities,
down from 364 in 1995, and 33 privately operated
facilities, up from 15 5 years earlier. No
federally-operated facility was under court order
preceding the 2000 Census; however, 77 were
under court directive to modify the inmate phone
service, and 1 was required to limit population in
1995.

State  Fewer State facilities were under court
order for the totality of conditions in 2000 (52)
than in 1995 (145). The number of State facilities
ordered to limit population dropped from 216 in
1995 to 119 in 2000. About the same number of
State institutions were under court orders for
specific conditions in 2000 (303) as in 1995 (315).

Crowding was the specific condition most
frequently cited in 2000 (98), followed by visiting,
mail, or telephone policies (97). Two conditions
that were not previously reported in large
numbers -- accommodation of the disabled (91),
and mental health treatment (86) -- were
important topics of court intervention, along with
practices relating to religious expression (88).

Among State facilities in 1995, crowding was
also the most frequently cited reason (208),
followed by medical facilities (136), library
services (126), staffing (114), and prisoner
recreation issues (97).

Private  Among the 33 private facilities under
court order at midyear 2000, 26 were ordered to
limit population, 7 were cited for the totality of 
conditions, and 17 for specific conditions. The
most frequently cited condition in 2000 was
grievance policies.

More inmate assaults on other inmates and 
staff in 2000 than in 1995 

Approximately 34,400 inmate assaults on other
inmates took place in confinement facilities
under Federal or State authority during the
annual period ending June 30, 2000, 32% more
than in 1995. Fewer attacks, however, resulted in
inmate deaths -- 51 in 2000 versus 82 in 1995.
The rate of assault on other prisoners rose from
27.0 to 28.0 per 1,000 inmates.

Assaults on staff rose approximately 27% from
about 14,200 in 1995 to 18,000 in 2000. Fewer
employees were killed in such attacks in 2000 (5)
than in 1995 (14). The rate of assault on staff was
nearly the same -- 14.7 per 1,000 inmates in 1995
and 14.6 per 1,000 in 2000. 

The number of major disturbances -- incidents
involving 5 or more inmates resulting in serious
injury or significant property damage was nearly
twice as high in 2000 (606) as in 1995 (317).  But
less than half as many fires were reported in the
latter year (343 versus 816).

More than 90% of facilities had work programs 

Work programs  Ninety-one percent of all
correctional facilities reported having some type
of work program. On June 30, 2000, 92% of State
and Federal facilities operated work programs,
whereas only 73% of private facilities reported
having work programs. Of the 1,208 confinement
facilities, 1,174 (97%) had work programs, and
community-based facilities, by contrast, had only
345 out of 460 facilities (75%) reporting some
type of work program.  

Facility support services were the most prevalent
type of work program across all types of
correctional facilities, with 100% of Federal
facilities reporting this type of program.
Community-based facilities had the smallest
percentage of this type of program (67%), but it
was still the most common of any work program.
Public works programs were the second-most
common type of program across all correctional
facilities (except Federal), ranging from 47%
(private) to 66% (State) of facilities operating
these programs.

About 46% of confinement facilities had prison
industries, 29% operated farms or other
agricultural activities, and 60% engaged in public
works projects such as road and park maintenance. 
Prison industries accounted for 5%, and farming, 7% 
of work programs in community-based facilities.

Nearly 90% of Federal facilities had prison
industries, 8% operated farms or other
agriculture, and 39% performed public works
projects. 

Education programs   Ninety-two percent of
Federal, 90% of State, and 80% of private
facilities offered some sort of education program
in 2000. Out of 1,208 confinement facilities, 1,140
(94%) operated education programs. 
Seventy-four percent of community-based
facilities did so. Of facilities offering educational
programs, 86-90% of all correctional facilities
conducted secondary (including GED programs)
or basic adult education classes. Three-fifths
offered vocational training; 42%, special
education; 32% operated college courses; and
10%, had study release programs. 

Counseling   Overall, more correctional facilities
provide counseling programs (96%) than either
educational (89%) or work programs (91%).
Ninety-seven percent of State confinement
facilities, 93% of community-based, and 92% of
Federal facilities offered counseling or other
special programs to inmates in 2000. Across all
facility types, drug and alcohol dependency
counseling, or awareness programs were the
most common.  
 
Among facilities providing counseling programs,
100% of Federal facilities offered psychological
and psychiatric counseling, compared to 66% of
States and 46% of private facilities. 

Considerably fewer community-based facilities
(32%) offered this type of counseling compared
to confinement facilities (77%).

Ninety percent of Federal facilities, 55% of
private, and 54% of State facilities with
counseling programs operated HIV/AIDS
counseling. Comparing confinement and
community-based facilities, 62% and 39% of
these facilities (respectively) provided some type
of HIV/AIDS counseling. 

Work release programs -- Twenty-nine percent of all
correctional institutions operated work release
programs in 2000. This included 20% of Federal
facilities, 25% of State, and 49% of private facilities.
About 77% of all community-based facilities offered
such programs, compared with 11% of confinement
institutions.

Approximately 28,100 Federal, State and private
facility inmates participated in work release
programs in 2000, 84% of them while assigned to
community-based facilities. More than 9 in every
10 private facility participants and more than 8 in
every 10 State participants resided in community-based 
facilities. 

95 facilities operated boot camps in 2000, up
from 65 in 1995

Prison boot camp programs were activities with
highly regimented activity schedules, drill and
ceremony, physical challenge and fitness,
discipline, and chain of command.

Thirty more boot camp programs were operating
in 2000 (95) than in 1995 (65). All but 13 camps
were located in minimum or medium security
institutions. About 9 in every 10 facilities with
boot camp programs housed either men only or
both men and women. The number housing women only 
increased from 6 in 1995 to 11 in 2000. A total of 
12,751 inmates were enrolled in boot camp programs 
on June 30, 2000, compared with 8,968 on the same 
day 5 years earlier.

Correctional staff exceeded 430,000 in 2000, 
an increase of 24% since 1995

The number of administrative, custody/security,
educational, and professional/technical staff
employed under the authority of State or Federal
corrections increased 22% to 28% during the 5
years preceding the 2000 Census. The number of
clerical, maintenance and food service workers
rose about 3% during this period.

Overall, correctional facilities added nearly
83,000 employees between 1995 and 2000, an
increase of 24%. At the same time, the number of
inmates rose 28%.

Among confinement facilities, all occupational
categories except clerical/maintenance/food
service gained between 22% and 24%. Staff
nearly doubled among community-based facilities, 
mirroring similar growth in its inmate population.

Correctional officers comprised 63% of facility
employees in 2000 

Approximately 65% of staff in State and 60% of staff
in private facilities in 2000 were correctional officers
or performed jobs related to custody or security). Among 
Federal facilities, however, custody or security staff 
comprised 38% of all employees. This difference was due 
in part to the larger percentage of  State (38%) than 
Federal (15%) inmates who were housed  in maximum security 
prisons -- in which closer staff supervision is required. 
In addition, although performing other duties, staff in 
Federal facilities are trained and qualified as correctional 
officers.

Nearly 36% of Federal employees were classified
as professional/technical, including counselors,
psychologists, social workers, chaplains, and
medical staff. An additional 2.5% were educational staff. 
In contrast, approximately 14% of staff in State facilities 
and 17% in private facilities were professional/ technical 
or educational employees.  

Wardens, superintendents, and others in administrative 
positions comprised 2.8% of all correctional staff. 
Private facility staff had the highest percentage 
administrative (5.9%), followed by staff in Federal 
facilities (5.3%) and State facilities 2.4%). 

Overall, 12% of all correctional employees were
clerical and maintenance -- 13% of State, 11% of
private, and 5% of Federal employees.

Community-based facilities had somewhat higher percentages 
employed as professional/technical (14%) and administrative
positions (6%) than did confinement facilities (11% and 
2%, respectively).

Correctional officers represented a larger
percentage of staff in confinement facilities
(65%) than in community-based facilities (58%).

Growing percentages of facility staff female,
black, or Hispanic

Among full-time and part-time payroll staff, the
number of females rose by  41% between 1995 and
2000, while the number of males rose by 17%. In
2000, 33% of all payroll staff were female, compared
to 29% in 1995.

Since the 1995 census, the number of Hispanic
employees increased by 53% and black
employees by 28%. The number of white
employees rose by 17%. By midyear 2000, 29%
of all staff were black or of Hispanic origin. 

Whites were more than twice as common among
the correctional payroll staff (69%), as they were
among the inmate population (36%). By contrast,
blacks made up 21% of employees and 46% of
the inmate population, and Hispanics, 8% of
employees and 16% of inmates.

White staff were relatively more common in
confinement facilities (69%) than in
community-based facilities (52%); black
employees (34%) and Hispanics (11%) were more
common in community-based facilities than in
confinement facilities (21% and 8%,
respectively).

Community-based facilities had the highest
number of inmates per employee in 2000
In 1995 and 2000, community-based facilities had
the greatest number of inmates per employee
(3.8 to 1, both years). Overall, the inmate-to-
employee ratio in 2000 was 3.0 to 1, only slightly
higher than in 1995 (2.9 to 1).

In both confinement and community-based
facilities the ratio of inmates to custody/security
employees was considerably lower than for all
other occupational categories. The highest ratio
of inmates per employees in confinement facilities
occurred among administrative employees (112
to 1).  In community-based facilities, there were
approximately 166 inmates for every educational 
employee. 

The number of inmates per employee highest in
private confinement facilities

Based on inmate population on June 30, 2000, the
highest number of inmates per employee was in
private confinement facilities (4.0 to 1), followed by
State community-based facilities (3.8 to 1). The lowest 
number was in State confinement institutions (2.9 to 1). 
In Federal confinement institutions the ratio was  3.4 
inmates per employee. 

On average, the number of inmates per correctional officer 
or other custody/ security employee in Federal confinement 
facilities was 9.0 inmates, nearly twice as many as in 
State confinement institutions (4.5 inmates) and 38% more 
than in State community-based facilities (6.2 inmates). 
The highest inmate-to-staff ratio across all facility types 
was among administrative employees (highest in State 
confinement facilities with a 126.1 to 1 inmate to employee 
ratio).  Each clerical, maintenance, and food service worker 
accounted for 22.5 inmates in State confinement, and 28.6 in 
State community-based facilities. 

Between 1995 and 2000, State confinement facility inmate-to-
employee ratios were fairly stable, with the overall ratio 
remaining 2.9 to 1 for 2000. Though the inmate-to-employee 
ratio in private community-based facilities (3.4 to 1) was
lower than that of State community-based facilities 
(3.8 to 1), and private confinement facilities (4.0 to 1), 
these private community-based facilities experienced the
largest change in the number of inmates relative to 
employees between the census years (2.5 to 1 in 1995 to 
3.4 to 1 in 2000). The number of inmates to clerical, 
maintenance, and food service employees doubled in these 
facilities in 2000, and there was a 73% increase in the
number of inmates to custody/security officers.

Private facilities increased in number and in size of
their inmate population during the 1990's 

The number of private correctional facilities
under contract to State or Federal authorities
increased 140% from 110 in 1995 to 264 in 2000. The
average daily number of inmates housed in
private facilities rose 455% from 16,426 in 1995
to 91,184 in 2000, or from approximately 1.7% to
7.1% of the average daily correctional population.
   
Facilities   Between 1995 and 2000, 72 additional
private confinement facilities were opened,
raising their number from 29 to 101; and 82 more
private community-based facilities began
operation, increasing from 81 to 163.  More than
a third of all private correctional facilities were
less than 10 years old. About 3 in every 4  had
low or minimum security, and a similar
proportion housed fewer than 500 inmates. In
more than half, the main function was work
release or prerelease.

Inmates  During the 5-year period ending June
30, 2000, the average daily number of inmates in
private confinement facilities increased from
12,534 to 76,170; and the private
community-based facility population grew from
3,892 to 15,014. Approximately two-thirds of all
private facility inmates were housed in facilities
less than 10 years old, and nearly all were held
under medium or minimum security. Nearly 9 in
every 10 served time in facilities with a main
function of general confinement or work
release/prerelease.

Less than half of 1% of inmates in State and private
facilities under age 18

State correctional facilities held a total of 4,095
inmates under the age of 18 on June 30, 2000,
about four-tenths of 1% of all State and private
facility inmates -- down from 5,309 in 1995.

Only two-tenths of 1% of all private facility
inmates were under age 18. The overwhelming
majority of youths who were in prison were in
State facilities (96%). There were no inmates
under 18 in federally run facilities.

All but 153 or 4% of prisoners under age 18 were
housed in confinement  facilities, including
nearly half (2,008) in maximum security
institutions. Most of the others (1,582) resided in 
medium security, and the remainder (505) in minimum 
or low security facilities. 

The Northeast had the highest proportion of
inmates under age 18 who were assigned to
maximum security prisons (60%), followed by the
South (53%), the Midwest (35%), and the West
(35%).

Rated capacity of prisons operating under State
authority expanded nearly 84% from 1990 to 2000 

The capacity of correctional facilities under State
authority, as measured by the number of beds or
inmates assigned by a rating official, rose 84%
from 650,600 in 1990 to 1,195,358 in 2000. During
this period the number of State prisoners grew
81% from 658,828 to 1,194,279. With minor
fluctuation, parity was maintained between
facility space and inmates.

The South experienced the largest 10 year
increase of 108%, followed by a 90% increase in
the west. The Midwest and Northeast
experienced smaller, but still substantial
increases in their rated capacities since 1995
(60% and 47%, respectively).

The most significant changes in regional rated
capacities occurred between 1990 and 1995. The
5-year period between 1995 and 2000 was
characterized by more stability in rated
capacities compared to the previous 5- year
period. The largest shift in the Nation's prison
space occurred in the South from 1990 to 1995
(increasing from 40% to 46%). The South
continued to represent 46% of the Nation's
prison capacity in 2000. The West's proportion of
prison capacity was virtually unchanged in the
10-year period, with 22% of capacity in 1990 and
23% in 2000.

Both the Northeast and the Midwest experienced
a decrease in their proportions of the Nation's
prison space. In 1990 the Northeast had 17% of
prison capacity, compared to 13% in 2000.

The Midwest's share declined from 21% to 18%
during the same period.    

Inmate growth continued to outstrip capacity in
the 1990’s as occupancy reached 101% in 1990
and 103% in 1995. But by midyear 2000 the
number of inmates and beds were about equal,
producing an occupancy rate of 100%. The most
recent census data of State facilities showed that
occupancy was highest in the Midwest (109%)and lowest 
in the South (95%).

Methodology

The 2000 Census of State and Federal Adult
Correctional Facilities was the sixth enumeration
of State institutions and the third of Federal
institutions sponsored by the Bureau of Justice
Statistics. Earlier censuses were completed in
1974, 1979, 1984, 1990, and 1995.

The facility universe was developed from the Census
of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities
conducted in 1995. Each department of correction
was contacted to identify new facilities and facilities
that had been closed since June 30, 1995.
Telephone follow-ups with data providers were
carried out in the fall of 2000 and resulted in a final
response rate of 100%.

Facilities were included in the census if they
were staffed with Federal, State, local, or private
employees; housed primarily State or Federal
prisoners; were physically, functionally, and
administratively separate from other facilities;
and were operational on June 30, 2000. The
census also included 264 private facilities under
exclusive contract to State governments or to the
Federal Bureau of Prisons to house prisoners.

The Census included the following types of State
and Federal adult correctional facilities: prisons,
prison farms; reception, diagnostic, and
classification centers; road camps; forestry and
conservation camps; youthful offender facilities
(except in California); vocational training
facilities; drug and alcohol treatment facilities;
and State-operated local detention facilities in
Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode
Island, and Vermont. (Of these six States only
Alaska had some locally administered correctional 
facilities.) 

Jails and other local regional detention facilities,
including those housing State prisoners, were
specifically excluded from the census, as were
private facilities not predominantly for State or
Federal inmates. Also excluded were facilities for
the military, Immigration and Naturalization
Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Marshals
Service, and correctional hospital wards not
operated by correctional authorities.

Correctional facilities were classified as
community-based if 50% or more of the residents
were regularly permitted to leave, unaccompanied,
to work or study. These facilities included halfway
houses, restitution centers, and prerelease, work
release, and study release centers.  Correctional 
facilities in which less than 50% of the inmates 
regularly left the facility unaccompanied were 
classified as confinement institutions.

Because the census was a complete enumeration, the 
results were not subject to sampling error. The census 
counted prisoners held in the facilities, a custody 
count. A jurisdictional count, more inclusive than a
custody count, includes all prisoners over whom 
correctional authorities exercised control.

For the purposes of comparability between the count of 
Federal facilities in 1995 and 2000, the 1995 count was 
adjusted to reflect the administrative merging of Federal 
camp facilities to 36 confinement facilities. This 
change in the accounting of the number of these facilities 
took place between 1995 and 2000.
