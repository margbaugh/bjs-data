---------------------------------------------------

From 2003 through 2009, a total of 4,813 deaths were reported
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics' (BJS) Arrest-Related
Deaths (ARD) program. Of these, about 6 in 10 deaths (2,931)
were classified as homicide by law enforcement personnel, and
4 in 10 (1,882) were attributed to other manners of death.
Suicide and death by intoxication each accounted for 11% of
reported arrest-related deaths, accidental injury for 6%, and
natural causes for 5% (figure 1).Deaths with manners
classified as undetermined or those in which manners were
unknown represented about 6% of reported arrest-related
deaths.

During the same period, the FBI estimated nearly 98 million
arrests in the United States. While men comprised about 76%
of reported arrests, they represented 95% of persons who died
during the process of arrest (figure 2). As a group, arrest
related decedents tended to be older than the arrest
population. Those under the age of 25 accounted for
45% of reported arrests but less than a quarter (22%) of
arrest-related deaths.

The ARD program is a national collection of persons who die
in the custody or under the restraint of state or local law
enforcement personnel. Deaths are reportable to the program
without considering whether physical custody had been
established or whether a formal arrest process had been
initiated prior to the time of death. Th e ARD collection
also includes the deaths of persons attempting to elude law
enforcement during the course of apprehension. Data collected
from January 2003 through December 2009 detail the percent
and type of arrest-related deaths, as well as the demographic
characteristics of decedents and the law enforcement
agencies involved in the death.

Arrest-related deaths are under-reported. BJS did not
attempt to estimate for partial or non-responding 
jurisdictions. Data are more representative of the nature
of arrest-related deaths than the volume at which they
occur. Due to variation in reporting, caution should be
used in comparing counts from year to year.

**********************************************
Highlights

Manner of death

* Homicide by law enforcement personnel accounted for
2,931(61%) of reported arrest-related deaths from 2003
through 2009 (table 1).

* Suicide and death by intoxication each accounted for about
11% of reported arrest-related deaths (table 2).

* Deaths due to natural causes were the least common type
of arrest-related death, comprising 5% (244) of all reported
deaths.

* Of all arrest-related deaths reported from 2003 through
2009, about 6% (273) had manners of death that were either
classified as undetermined or were unreported.

Decedent characteristics

* From 2003 through 2009, males comprised 95% of all
reported deaths during the process of arrest (table 4).

* Whites accounted for 42% of reported arrest-related
deaths, 32% were black, and 20% were Hispanic.

* More than half (55%) of all persons who died during the
process of arrest were between the ages of 25 and 44.

Manner of death and decedent characteristics

* Among reported arrest-related suicides, 60% of decedents
were white, 20% were Hispanic, and 15% were black (table 6).

* Of all arrest-related deaths by intoxication, blacks
were 41% of reported decedents, whites were 34%, and
Hispanics were 21%.

* Among males, homicide accounted for 62% of reported
arrest-related deaths. Of all females, homicide represented
49% of arrest-related deaths (table 7).

* A higher percentage of female arrest-related deaths than
male deaths were attributed to intoxication (16% compared
to 11%) and natural causes (12% compared to 5%).

* Adults between ages 25 and 44 represented 70% of all
reported arrest-related deaths due to intoxication.

* Juveniles (persons under the age of 18) comprised 3%
(127) of all arrest-related deaths reported from 2003
through 2009. Most juvenile deaths (78%) were homicides.

Incident circumstances

* The FBI estimated state and local law enforcement officers
made 97.9 million arrests from 2003 through 2009.
During the same period, 4,813 arrest-related deaths were
reported to BJS (table 12).

* Of reported arrest-related deaths, 45% of decedents
allegedly engaged in assault either immediately prior to or
during the process of arrest (table 13).

*No criminal charges were intended to be filed against 163
(3%) persons who died during the process of arrest.

*Among arrest-related deaths attributed to homicide, 75%
of decedents allegedly engaged in violent offenses (table
14).

Law enforcement agency characteristics

* Nationwide, 7% (1,187) of state and local law enforcement
agencies with 100 or more full-time sworn personnel
employed 64% of these law enforcement personnel and
accounted for 75% (3,613) of all reported arrest-related
deaths (table 15).

* State and local law enforcement agencies employing fewer
than 10 full-time sworn personnel (8,796) represented 49% of
all agencies nationwide, employed 5% (34,497) of all
full-time sworn personnel, and accounted for about 2%  (117)
of reported arrest-related deaths.

Methodology 

The Arrest-Related Deaths (ARD) data collection cycle begins
January 1 and ends December 31 of the calendar year. State
Reporting Coordinators (SRC) assist the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) in collecting information regarding
arrest-related deaths. The role of each SRC is to identify
deaths reportable to the ARD program, compile information
from valid sources regarding the circumstances related to the
death, complete CJ-11 and CJ-11A data collection forms
(http://www.bjs.gov), and submit data to BJS quarterly or
annually. Annual data are available from 2003 through 2009
in aggregate form. All information identifying individual
decedents is kept confidential.

Defining deaths "in the process of arrest"

Although the Deaths in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (DICRA),
Public Law 106-297, mandated that all in custody deaths be
counted, the legislation did not specify the meaning of the
phrase "in the process of arrest." BJS staff consulted with
the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), the
National Sheriffs' Association (NSA), and criminal justice
researchers to identify which circumstances involved an
arrest process. For this data collection, BJS defines -in
the process of arrest" to include all circumstances in which
a person is in the custody or under the restraint of
law enforcement officers. This definition includes situations
in which a formal arrest process was neither initiated nor
intended. It includes instances in which law enforcement
personnel actively pursues or attempts to apprehend a
criminal suspect, regardless of whether physical custody
was established. In addition, it includes deaths that
involved law enforcement assistance in restraining and
transporting individuals in need of medical or mental health
care.

Exclusions

Deaths that occurred in a jail or other long-term holding
facility and deaths that occurred in the custody of federal
law enforcement officers were outside the scope of the ARD
program and excluded from the analysis. All records submitted
to the ARD program were cross-referenced with records
submitted to BJS's Deaths in Custody Reporting Program -
Jails collection in order to ensure cases were not duplicated
across collections. If the death was recorded in both
collections, the Jails component took priority and the
record was removed from the ARD collection. The DICRA did not
apply to federal law enforcement agencies. Deaths occurring
in the presence of officers from federal agencies (i.e., FBI,
DEA, or Marshals Service) were only reportable to the ARD
program if an officer from either a state or local
law enforcement agency was also present during the event
causing the death. Arrest-related deaths that did not involve
either a state or local law enforcement agency were excluded
from the collection.

Role of State Reporting Coordinators

Participation in the ARD program is voluntary. SRCs may
select any methodology--or a combination of approaches--that
achieves a reliable measure of arrest-related deaths. Some
methods for identifying arrest-related deaths include
surveying all police departments in the state, surveying all
county medical examiners or coroner's offices in the state,
extracting data from other collections (i.e., FBI's Uniform
Crime Reports and CDC's National Violent Death Reporting
System), and conducting multi-media searches. BJS recommends
SRCs do not solely rely on a system of voluntary
self-reporting by state and local law enforcement agencies.

Once a reportable death is identified, the SRC is responsible
for obtaining information regarding the death and completing
an arrest-related death incident report (CJ-11A). Most SRCs
use multiple data sources to compile information required to
complete the CJ-11A incident reports. A survey of SRCs
conducted in 2007 indicated that of the 47 states
participating in the ARD program at some point between 2003
and 2006, 42 used multiple sources to obtain information on
arrest-related deaths, while 30 states reported at least 3
different sources of data.

State and local law enforcement agencies were the most common
source of data used by SRCs. Law enforcement agencies
voluntarily reported arrest-related deaths to 40 data
providers. In California and Texas, law enforcement agencies
were required by state law to submit arrest-related deaths.
The SRCs were asked to work with the law enforcement
agency involved in the death to collect the information
requested on the CJ-11A form. In instances where the law
enforcement agency involved in the death did not complete the
CJ-11A form, the SRC was asked to obtain information from
official source documents (such as a police report or
death certificate) or indirectly through oral communication,
press releases from the involved law enforcement agency or
medical office, legal proceedings, or other vetted sources of
information. Media accounts of the event and death were not
considered sources of official information.

Subsequently, SRCs were discouraged from using media accounts
of the event as their primary source of information when
completing the CJ-11A form. In the event that the SRC could
not obtain information from any other source, BJS authorized
the use of media accounts to supplement incomplete CJ-11A
forms.

Program Coverage

The ARD program was initiated in order to comply with
requirements set forth in the DICRA. The legislation required
the U.S Department of Justice to begin a quarterly collection
of individual death records for all persons incarcerated in
local jails, state prisons, juvenile correctional facilities,
as well as "any person who is in the process of arrest."
Since the expiration of the DICRA legislation in 2006, BJS
has continued to collect ARD data, but no longer requires
quarterly submissions.
                                         
As the statistical agency for the Justice Department, BJS
began implementing the ARD data collection in 2003. When the
DICRA was enacted, only California and Texas (each pursuant
to state law) conducted a statewide count of all
arrest-related deaths. In the remaining 48 states and
the District of Columbia, the ARD program was the first
attempt to perform a comprehensive count of all deaths
occurring during the process of arrest. The attorneys general
of California and Texas agreed to complete statewide reports
of arrest-related deaths for submission to BJS. In all other
jurisdictions, BJS worked with state officials to determine
which agency would collect arrest-related death reports.
During reporting year 2006, a state criminal justice
commission, commonly administered by the governor's office
was the most common data reporting contact (22    states),
followed by the state attorney general and state police
department (8 states each) (see appendix table 1). In five
states, the department of corrections took a lead role in
compiling records. In over 30 states, the reporting office
also served as a state criminal justice Statistical Analysis
Center (SAC).

While every state identified a data provider, three states--
Georgia, Maryland, and Montana--did not submit records during
the 2003-2009 collection periods. Forty-seven states and the
District of Columbia participated in the collection at some
point, but the participation of some states varied by year.
(See appendix table 2 for a summary of state reporting
participation.) Although a jurisdiction may not have
participated in the ARD program in a given year, arrest-
related deaths may have been identified and reported by BJS
staff.

In an effort to increase the ARD program's national coverage,
BJS began exploring the use of internet-based searches to
retrospectively identify arrest-related deaths occurring from
2007 through 2009. BJS staff conducted online media searches
based on 12 key terms and identified websites dedicated to
either in-custody deaths or deaths associated with the usage
of specific weapons, such as conductive energy devices. Once
an arrest-related death was identified, all available
information was sent to the appropriate SRC for verification
and follow-up. The SRC was asked to complete a CJ-11A form
using official source documents and then return the form to
BJS.
