NCVS estimates based on new methods

Violent and property crime rates in urban and suburban areas
of the United States remained stable between 2005 and 2006,
according to findings from the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS). Due to changes in survey methodology in 2006
that mainly affected rural areas, national-level estimates
were not comparable to estimates based on NCVS data from
previous years. Continuity between urban and suburban areas
in the sample for both years enabled year-to-year comparisons
for these areas.

In urban and suburban areas, U.S. residents age 12 or older
in 2006 experienced an estimated 3.7 million violent crimes
(rape or sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple
assault), 138,520 personal thefts (pocket picking and purse
snatching), and 12 million property crimes (burglary, motor
vehicle theft, and theft).***footnote 1: Estimates are based
on urban and suburban areas in the sample (continuing areas)
in both 2005 and 2006. See forthcoming Technical notes
for details on changes in sample design.*** The overall
violent crime rate in these areas was 23.3 victimizations per
1,000 persons age 12 or older; the property crime rate was
159.1 per 1,000 households.

The U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS), and a panel of outside experts extensively reviewed
the 2006 NCVS data and determined that there was a break in
series between 2006 and previous years that prevented annual
comparison of criminal victimization at the national level.
This was mainly the result of three major changes in the
survey methodology--

*introducing a new sample to account for shifts in population
and location of households that occur over time

*incorporating responses from households that were in the
survey for the first time

*using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). 

The introduction of the new sample affected the NCVS
estimates in areas that were added in 2006, especially
nonurban areas. The new sample required hiring and training a
large number of new interviewers in the new areas. In
addition, based on the experience of the U.S. Census Bureau
computer-assisted personal interviewing has been associated
with improved, but higher survey estimates.

The variation in the amount and rate of crime was too extreme
to be attributed to actual year-to-year changes. For areas
that were in both the old and new samples--primarily urban
and suburban areas--the data for 2006 were consistent with
data from previous years. Survey changes had the most impact
on estimates for rural areas. Eighty-three percent of rural
households were in new sampling areas, compared with 14% of
households in urban areas and 15% in suburban areas. 

Annual nationwide estimates of crime victimization can be
generated from NCVS for 2006. Overall U.S. residents age 12
or older experienced an estimated 25 million crimes of
violence and theft. The overall violent crime rate was 24.6
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older; for
property crimes it was 159.5 per 1,000 households.

Implementation of the methodological changes 
in the NCVS

The NCVS sample was redrawn to update representation of the
entire population of the United States based on more recent
Census counts. A selected number of households in the sample
that were based on the 1990 Decennial Census was replaced
with newly selected households based on the 2000 Census. In
general, interviews from households in NCVS for the first
time produce higher rates of victimization. Typically, these
first interviews are not included in the data for analysis
but are used as a reference (bounding interview) for
subsequent interviews. In 2006 BJS was required to use data
from these first-time interviews due to insufficient funding
(See forthcoming Technical notes for discussion of 
bounding interviews).

Similar to first-time interviews, automation of data
collections also typically produce higher rates of
victimization. In July 2006, NCVS replaced paper and pencil
interviews (PAPI) with CAPI because the Census Bureau
discontinued paper and pencil household surveys. While the
conversion to CAPI was expected to produce higher rates of
crime, BJS did not have sufficient funds to develop
procedures to evaluate the impact of the questionnaire
automation and generate statistical parameters to control for
the effects. 

Victimization estimates showed the effects of pre-
redesign and post-redesign adjustments in the past

When NCVS underwent a redesign in 1992, two comparable
samples were conducted. This made it possible to develop an
adjustment factor that showed what the victimization
estimates would have been if the redesigned survey had been
used from 1973 through 1992.***Footnote 2:See Effects of the
Redesign on Victimization Estimates (April 1997) 
at <http://www. ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/erve.htm>.*** 
When the adjustment ratio was applied to the data, violent
crime rates in 1992 increased from 32.1 to 47.8 per 1,000
persons (figure 1). For property crimes, in 1992 the rates
increased from 152.2 to 325.3 per 1,000 households (figure
2). The adjustments in the series between 1973 and 1992 for
violent and property crime permitted trend data to be
maintained. 

If it had been possible to conduct two comparable samples in
the 2006 redesign, there would have been a similar adjustment
factor to make the 2006 data comparable to 2005. While the
rates for both violent and property crime increased between
2005 and 2006, it is unknown how much of the increase was
caused by methodological changes rather than any real change
in crime trends. 

Estimates for urban and suburban areas in 2006 were
comparable to previous years

Some areas in the sample were included in both the old and
new sample designs. They were principally in urban and
suburban locations. Violent and property crime rates in these
locations remained unchanged between 2005 and 2006 (table 1).
 
In 2006 U.S. residents age 12 or older residing in continuing
urban areas experienced an estimated 8.3 million violent and
property crimes. These criminal victimizations included about
2 million violent crimes, 90,000 personal thefts, and 6.3
million property crimes. The rate of violent crime in
continuing urban areas, 30 victimizations per 1,000
individuals age 12 or older, was unchanged from 2005. The
rate of property crime victimization, 195 victimizations per
1,000 urban households, was also unchanged.

In 2006 U.S. residents age 12 or older residing in continuing
suburban areas experienced an estimated 7.7 million violent
and property crimes. These criminal victimizations included
an estimated 1.8 million violent crimes, 48,000 personal
thefts, and 5.9 million property crimes. In 2006 the rate of
violent crime (19 victimizations per 1,000 individuals age 12
or older) and property crime (133 per 100 households) were
unchanged from 2005. 

U.S. residents age 12 or older experienced an estimated 25
million violent and property crimes in 2006

While national-level estimates of criminal victimizations in
2006 cannot be compared to previous years, the data provide
an annual description of the nature of crime in the United
States. In 2006 U.S. residents age 12 or older experienced an
estimated 25 million violent and property crime
victimizations, according to the NCVS (table 2). These
criminal victimizations included an estimated 19 million
property crimes, 6 million violent crimes, and 174,000
personal thefts.

At the national level characteristics of victims remained the
same as in previous years

The break in the NCVS series shifted the relative magnitude
of victimization rates overall, but did not alter the
relative proportions of crimes experienced among various
demographic groups. In 1993 after the NCVS redesign, which
improved the ability to measure crimes, the relative risk of
victimization for certain groups remained the same. For
instance, males were still more likely to experience
victimization than females. In 2006 estimates of
characteristics of crime victims and incidents of crime
remained consistent with those of previous years.

Gender

In 2006 males experienced higher rates of victimizations than
females. During this time, males experienced 26 violent
victimizations per 1,000 males age 12 or older. The rate of
violent victimizations for females in 2006 was 23 per 1,000
females age 12 or older (table 3).

Age

Persons in older age groups generally experienced lower rates
of violent victimization than persons in younger age groups.
In 2006, households that were headed by persons age 65 or
older experienced lower rates of property victimization than
households headed by younger persons
(table 4).

Race

Black victims experienced higher rates of violence than
whites or persons of other races (table 5). The rate of
violent victimization for black individuals was 33
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older. In 2006
households headed by black individuals were at a greater risk
of property victimization than those headed by whites or
persons of other races. 

Victim and offender relationship

Of offenders victimizing males in 2006, 5% were described as
intimates and 47% as strangers (table 6). In contrast, of
offenders victimizing females 21% were described as intimates
and 29% as strangers. Males and females were equally likely
to be victimized by an offender they previously knew. 

Presence of weapons

In 2006 an estimated 25% of all violent crime incidents were
committed by an armed offender (table 7). The presence of a
firearm was involved in 9% of these incidents. 

In 2006 there were 499,890 incidents and 560,300 firearm
victimizations (not shown in table). There were 2.3
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older involving a
firearm. An incident is a specific criminal act involving one
or more victims and offenders while a victimization is a
crime that affects one individual person or household. 

Reporting to the police

During 2006, 49% of all violent victimizations and 38% of all
property crimes were reported to the police (table 8). Rape
or sexual assault was less likely to be reported to the
police than robbery and aggravated assault. Robbery and
aggravated assault were equally likely to be reported to the
police. Fifty-seven percent of robberies and 59% of
aggravated assaults were reported to the police in 2006. As
in previous years, motor vehicle theft was the property crime
most likely to be reported to the police. About 81% of these
victimizations were reported to the police in 2006.

Methodology

This Bulletin presents data on nonlethal violence and
property crimes from the National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS). Victimization rates are based on data collected
during the calendar year. In 2006, about 76,000 households
and 135,300 individuals age 12 or older were interviewed for
the NCVS. The response rate was 90.9% of eligible households
and 86.1% of eligible individuals. See the Technical Notes
Appendix for details on methodological changes to the 2006
survey.

Standard error computations

Comparisons of percentages and rates made in this report were
tested to determine if observed differences were
statistically significant. Differences described as higher,
lower, or different passed a test at the 0.05 level of
statistical significance (95% confidence level). Differences
described as somewhat, slightly, marginally, or some
indication  passed a test at the 0.10 level of statistical
significance (90% confidence level). Caution is required when
comparing estimates not explicitly discussed in this
Bulletin.
