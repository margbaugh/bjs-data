Highlights

Nation's prison population rose 1.6%; jail population, 4.7%

From midyear 2004 to midyear 2005 --

* The number of inmates in custody in local jails rose by
33,539; in State prison by 15,858; and in Federal prison 
by 6,584.

* The smaller State prison systems had the greatest percentage
increase: Montana (up 7.9%) and South Dakota (up 7.8%). 

On June 30, 2005 --

* A total of 2,266 State prisoners were under age 18. Adult
jails held a total of 6,759 persons under age 18.

* State and Federal correctional authorities held 91,117
noncitizens (6.4% of all prisoners), down from 91,815 at
midyear 2004.

* There were 129 female prison and jail inmates per 100,000
women in the United States, compared to 1,366 male prison
and jail inmates per 100,000 men.

* An estimated 12% of black males, 3.7% of Hispanic males, and
1.7% of white males in their late twenties were in prison or
jail.

* In three States--Iowa, South Dakota, and Wisconsin--black 
prison and jail inmates represented 4% of the black State 
population. Pennsylvania (with 1,714 Hispanic inmates per 
100,000 Hispanic residents) and Idaho(1,654) had the highest 
Hispanic incarceration rates.

* Local jails were operating 5% below their rated capacity. 
In contrast, at yearend 2004 State prison systems were between
1% below capacity and 15% above; the Federal prison system
was operating at 40% above rated capacity. 

* Privately operated prison facilities held 101,228 inmates
(up 2.7% since midyear 2004). The Federal system reported
the largest increase among inmates in private prisons (up
2,038).
---------------------------------------------------------

At midyear 2005 the Nation's prisons and jails incarcerated
2,186,230 persons. Prisoners in the custody of the 50 States 
and the Federal system accounted for two-thirds of the 
incarcerated population (1,438,701) inmates). The other third 
were held in local jails (747,529), not including persons in 
community-based programs.***Foot note 1: See box on page 7 for 
description of jail populations.***

On June 30, 2005, 1,512,823 prisoners were under Federal and
State jurisdiction, which includes inmates in custody and persons 
under the legal authority of a prison system but held outside 
its facilities. During the 12-month period ending June 30, 2005,
the number under State jurisdiction rose 1.2%, while the number 
under Federal jurisdiction rose 2.9%. Montana (up 7.9%), South
Dakota (up 7.8%), Minnesota (up 6.7%), and Kentucky(up 6.4%)had 
the largest percentage increases. Twelve States had decreases, 
including Vermont (-2.9%), Idaho (-2.8%), and New York (-2.5%). 

At midyear 2005 local jail authorities held or supervised 819,434 
offenders. Nine percent of these offenders (71,905) were supervised 
outside jail facilities in programs such as community service, 
work release, weekend reporting, electronic monitoring, and other 
alternative programs. 

Incarceration rate for Nation 
reaches 738 per 100,000 residents

On June 30, 2005, 1,431,468 inmates were in the custody of State 
and Federal prison authorities, and 747,529 inmates were in the 
custody of local jail authorities. In the first 6 months of 2005,
the Nation's prison population increased 16,622 (1.2%). These 
data were collected in the 2005 National Prisoner Statistics 
program and the 2005 Census of Jail Inmates. (See Methodology,
page 11, for a description of data collections.)

Since midyear 2004 the total incarcerated population has increased 
2.6%. Including inmates in privately operated facilities, the number 
of inmates in State prisons increased 1.3%; in Federal prisons, 3.9%; 
and in local jails, 4.7%. At midyear 2005 Federal prisons (including 
all secure and non-secure public and private facilities) held 8.4% 
of all inmates, up from 5.6% in 1995. 

In the decade between yearend 1995 and midyear 2005, the incarceration
population grew an average of 3.4% annually. During this period the 
Federal and State prison populations and the local jail population 
grew at the average annual rates of 7.4%, 2.5%, and 3.9%, respectively. 

In the 12 months before midyear 2005, the number of inmates in prison 
and jails rose an estimated 56,428 inmates, or 1,085 per week. 

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail in 2005 was 738
inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents--up from 725 at midyear 
2004. At midyear 2005, 1 in every 136 U.S. residents were in 
prison or jail. 

Federal system growth continues to 
outpace that of States

The rate of growth of the State prison population slowed
between 1995 and 2001 and then began to rise. During this 
time the percentage change in the first 6 months of each 
year steadily decreased, reaching a low of 0.6% in 2001, 
and then rose to 1.0% in 2005. The percentage change in the 
second 6 months of each year showed a similar trend, resulting 
in an actual decrease in State prison populations for the 
second half of 2000 and 2001. 

Since 1995 the Federal system has grown at a much higher rate 
than the States, peaking at 6.0% growth in the first 6 months 
of 1999. In the first 6 months of 2005, the number of Federal
inmates increased 2.3%, more than twice the rate of State
growth. 

Some of the Federal growth since 1999 has been the result of
the transfer of responsibility for housing sentenced felons 
from the District of Columbia (DC). The transfer to Federal 
facilities was completed by yearend 2001. Since then, the 
Federal system has continued to receive sentenced felons from 
DC Superior Court. 

In absolute numbers the total increase of 20,989 State and
Federal prison inmates between July 1, 2004, and June 30, 
2005, was significantly lower than the growth during the 
previous 12-month period (27,637 inmates). 

The percentage change from midyear 2004 to midyear 2005 (1.4%) 
was also smaller than the percentage change between 2003 and 
2004 (1.9%). The average annual growth from 1995 to 2005 was 
3.0%. 

Federal system accounts for over 
25% of inmate population increase

Twenty-five percent of the Nation's prison population growth
during the 12 months ending June 30, 2005, was accounted for 
by the 5,274 additional inmates under jurisdiction of the 
Federal system. During this 12-month period, several States 
also experienced substantial growth, including Montana (7.9%), 
South Dakota (7.8%), and Minnesota (6.7%). Twelve States 
experienced a decline in their prison population. Vermont had 
the largest percentage decrease (-2.9%), followed by Idaho 
(-2.8%) and New York (-2.5%). 

----------------------------------------------------
Prison incarceration rates continue to rise

The incarceration rate of State and Federal prisoners
sentenced to more than 1 year was 488 per 100,000 U.S.
residents on June 30, 2005, up from 486 per 100,000 
December 31, 2004. At midyear 2005, 10 States exceeded the 
national rate led by Louisiana with 824 sentenced prisoners 
per 100,000 State residents, Texas with 703, and Mississippi
with 682. Nine States had rates that were less than half of
the national rate including Maine (153), Minnesota and Rhode
Island (both 179), and New Hampshire (196). 

Overall, the State incarceration rate rose about 14% between
yearend 1995 and midyear 2005, from 379 to 433 prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents. At the same time the Federal
incarceration rate rose 72%, from 32 to 55 prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents. 

Since yearend 1995 the total number of sentenced inmates per
100,000 residents has risen from 411 to 488. During this
period prison incarceration rates rose most in the Midwest
(from 310 to 380), followed by the West (from 358 to 421)
and the South (from 483 to 542). The rate in the Northwest
decreased slightly from 301 to 298.          

A quarter of inmates in private facilities held for Federal
system

In the 12 months ending June 30, 2005, the number of prisoners 
held in privately operated facilities increased from 98,570 to 
101,228, an increase of 2.7%. Overall, private facilities held 
6.7% of all State and Federal inmates, up from 6.6% at midyear 
2004. The Federal system (26,544), Texas (15,414), Oklahoma 
(5,812), and Florida (5,423) reported the largest number of 
inmates in private facilities at midyear 2005. Four States, 
all in the West, had at least a quarter of their prisoners in 
private facilities. 
-----------------------------------------------

Female inmate population continues 
to rise at a faster rate than male 
inmate population

From June 30, 2004, to June 30, 2005, the number of women
under the jurisdiction of State and Federal prison 
authorities grew from 102,691 to 106,174, an increase of 
3.4%. The number of men rose 1.3%, from 1,389,143 to 
1,406,649. At midyear 2005 California, Texas, Florida, and 
the Federal system housed 4 of every 10 female inmates. 

Since 1995 the annual rate of growth in the number of female
inmates has averaged 4.7%, higher than the 3.0% average 
increase of male inmates. Women accounted for 7.0% of all 
inmates at midyear 2005, up from 6.1% at yearend 1995. 

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident population, men 
were over 14 times more likely than women to be incarcerated 
in a State or Federal prison. On June 30, 2005, the rate for
inmates serving a sentence of more than 1 year was 64 female
inmates per 100,000 women in the United States, compared to 
925 male inmates per 100,000 men. 

Number of State inmates under age 
18 continues to decline

A total of 2,266 State prisoners were under age 18 on June 30, 
2005, down from 2,485 at midyear 2004. The number of minors 
held in State prisons peaked in 1995 at 5,309 and has since 
decreased every year. Overall, 0.2% of all State prisoners 
were under age 18. 

Six States reported more than 100 prisoners under age 18 at
midyear 2005, led by Connecticut(383), New York(223), Florida 
(185), and North Carolina (169). Two of these States reported 
an increase in their under age 18 populations held in prison
during the 12 months ending June 30, 2005, while the rest 
experienced declines. 

Three States reported no inmates under age 18, and another
19 States had 10 or fewer inmates under age 18.             

At midyear 2005, 61% of noncitizen 
prisoners held in State facilities; 
39% in Federal facilities 

On June 30, 2005, 91,117 noncitizens were in the custody of
State or Federal correctional authorities, down from 91,815 
at midyear 2004. Overall, 6.4% of State and Federal inmates 
at midyear 2005 were not U.S. citizens. The noncitizen 
prisoner population increased between 1998 and 1999, and 
since then it has remained nearly stable, increasing about 
2.6% between midyear 1999 and midyear 2005. 

At midyear 2005, 35,285 Federal inmates were noncitizens,
representing about 19% of all prisoners in Federal custody. 
California(16,613), Texas(9,346), New York(7,444), Florida
(4,772), and Arizona (4,179) held over 75% of all
noncitizens confined in State prisons. Noncitizen prisoners 
accounted for over 10% of the prison populations of Arizona, 
New York, Nevada, and California. 

Growth continues as rising 
admissions outpace releases

From 2000 to 2004 admissions to State prison rose 11.5%(from 
625,219 in 2000 to 697,066 in 2004). During 2004, 672,202 
sentenced prisoners were released from State prisons, up from
604,858 in 2000 -- an increase of 11.1%. 

Admissions to the Federal prison system increased 21.2% between 
2000 and 2004 (from 43,732 to 52,982); releases increased 32.2% 
(35,259 to 46,624). The number of admissions to Federal prison 
in 2004 exceeded releases by more than 6,300 inmates. 

New court commitments on the rise

Prior to 1998 growth in prison admissions reflected increasing 
numbers of offenders returning for parole violations. Between 
1990 and 1998 the number of returned parole violators increased 
54% (from 133,870 to 206,152), while the number of new court
commitments increased 7% (from 323,069 to 347,270). 

However, since 1998, parole violators returned to prison increased 
by less than 6%, while new court commitments rose 18%.                      

At midyear the Nation's jails 
supervised 819,434 persons

Based on the 2005 Census of Jail Inmates, the Nation's local
jails held or supervised 819,434 offenders on June 30, 2005. 
Jail authorities supervised 9% of these offenders(71,905)in
alternative programs outside the jail facilities. A total of
747,529 persons were housed in local jails. 

-----------------------------------
Jail populations

As defined in this report, jails are locally operated
correctional facilities that confine persons before or 
after adjudication. Inmates sentenced to jail usually 
have a sentence of 1 year or less. Jails also -- 

* receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them
awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing

* readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and
absconders

* temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to juvenile
authorities

* hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to
appropriate mental health facilities

* hold individuals for the military, for protective custody,
for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses

* release convicted inmates to the community upon completion
of sentence

* transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other authorities

* house inmates for Federal, State, or other authorities
because of crowding of their facilities

* sometimes operate community-based programs as alternatives
to incarceration. 
-------------------------------------

Among persons under community supervision by jail staff in 2005, 
22% were required to perform community service (15,536) and 20% 
participated in a weekend reporting program (14,110). Sixteen 
percent of offenders in the community were under electronic 
monitoring; 21% were under other pretrial supervision; 3% were 
in a drug, alcohol, mental health, or other type of medical 
treatment program; and 10% were participating in a work release 
or other alternative work program. 

Number of jail inmates rose 33,539 
in 12 months ending June 30, 2005

Between July 1, 2004 and June 30, 2005, the number of persons held 
in local jail facilities grew 4.7%--from 713,990 to 747,529. The 
12-month increase was larger than the average annual growth(3.9%) 
from midyear 1995 to midyear 2005. The 4.7% growth in 2005 was the
largest annual growth since the 5.4% growth in 2002. In absolute 
numbers the total increase of 33,539 inmates in 2005 was the 
largest increase since 1997 (48,587 new inmates). 

Jail incarceration rates rose in the last 12-month period
Since 1995 the Nation's jail population on a per capita
basis has increased 31%. During this
period the number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents rose
from 193 to 252.

When individuals under community supervision by jail authorities 
are included with those in custody, the rate was 276 persons 
per 100,000 U.S. residents at midyear 2005. 

A total of 6,759 persons under age 18 were housed in adult jails 
on June 30, 2005. Approximately 85% of these young inmates had 
been convicted or were being held for trial as adults in criminal 
court. The average daily population for the year ending June 30, 
2005, was 733,442, an increase of 3.9% from 2004 and 43.9% from 
1995. 

Characteristics of jail inmate 
population changing gradually

Male inmates made up 87.3% of the local jail inmate population at
midyear 2005 -- 2.5 percentage points lower than at midyear 1995.
During the 12-month period ending June 30, 2005, the number of 
adult female inmates rose 8.0%, while the number of adult male
inmates increased 4.3%. On average the adult female jail
population has grown 6.2% annually in the past 10 years, while 
the adult male population has grown 3.7%.

At midyear 2005 nearly 6 in 10 persons in local jails were
racial or ethnic minorities. Whites made up 44.3% of the jail 
population; blacks, 38.9%; Hispanics, 15.0%; and other races 
(American Indians, Alaska Natives, Asians, Native Hawaiians,
and other Pacific Islanders), 1.7%. 

On a per capita basis, men were over 7 times more likely than 
women to have been held in a local jail on June 30, 2005. 
Blacks were nearly 5 times more likely than whites, nearly 3 
times more likely than Hispanics, and over 9 times more likely
than persons of other races to have been in jail. 

On June 30, 2005, 62% of the Nation's jail inmates were
awaiting court action on their current charge. An estimated 
284,400 inmates held in local jails were serving a sentence in 
jail, awaiting sentencing, or serving time for a probation or 
parole violation. As a percent of all jail inmates, the percent 
convicted has dropped from 44.0% at midyear 2000 to 38.0% at 
midyear 2005. 

At midyear 2005, 95% of jail capacity 
was occupied

In the 12 months ending June 30, 2005, fewer beds than inmates 
were added to the Nation's jails. At midyear 2005 the rated 
capacity of local jails was estimated at 789,001 beds, an 
increase of 33,398 in 12 months. In the same 12-month period, 
an additional 33,539 inmates were added to the local jail
population. 

Rated capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates
allocated by State or local rating officials to each jail 
facility. The growth in jail capacity during the 12-month 
period ending June 30, 2005, was larger (33,398) than the 
average growth of 24,229 beds every 12 months since midyear 
1995, and was the largest growth since 1999 (39,541). 

As of June 30, 2005, 95% of the local jail capacity was
occupied.***footnote 2: On December 31, 2004, State prison 
systems were between 1% below and 15% above capacity.
The Federal prison system was operating at 40% above
capacity. See Prisoners in 2004, October 2005, NCJ 210677.***  
As a ratio of all inmates housed in jail facilities to total 
capacity, the percentage occupied increased steadily since 
2001 (up 5 percentage points). 

A third of all jail inmates were held 
in 4 States at midyear 2005

On June 30, 2005, 4 States incarcerated more than a third of
all local jail inmates: California (82,138), Texas (66,534), 
Florida (63,620), and Georgia (44,965). The 10 States with the 
smallest jail populations each held fewer than 4,000 inmates. 
Collectively, jails in these States held only 3.1% of the 
Nation's total jail population.

The number of jail inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents totaled 
252 on June 30, 2005. Of the 21 States with rates greater than 
that the national average, 11 were in the South, 7 were in the 
West, 2 in the Midwest, and 1 was in the Northeast. States that
had the largest number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents 
were Louisiana (703), Georgia (496), New Mexico (442), Tennessee 
(406), and Kentucky (402). Five States--Maine (117), Iowa (123),
New Hampshire (132), and Minnesota and North Dakota (both 
137)--had rates that were less than 150 jail inmates per 100,000 
State residents. The District of Columbia, a entirely urban 
jurisdiction, had a rate of 645 jail inmates. 

Louisiana and Georgia held at least 
1% of their State population in 
prison or jail 

More than 1% of residents in Louisiana and Georgia were in 
prison or jail at midyear 2005. Louisiana led the Nation with 
1,138 prison and jail inmates per 100,000 State residents, 
followed by Georgia (1,021) and Texas (976). Maine (273), 
Minnesota (300), Rhode Island (313), and Vermont (317) held 
the fewest inmates relative to their State populations.  
 
Southern States had significantly higher total incarceration
rates than States in other regions. Ten of the 14 States with 
rates higher than the national total were in the South. Arizona 
(808 inmates per 100,000 residents), New Mexico (782), Idaho 
(784), and Nevada (752) were the only States outside of the 
South with rates above the national average. The combined prison 
and jail incarceration rates totaled 846 in the South, followed 
by 663 in the West, 563 in the Midwest, and 494 in the Northeast. 

States also varied in the percentage of inmates held in local 
jails. Among all States at midyear 2005, 37% of inmates were 
housed in local facilities. Louisiana (with the highest 
incarceration rate) also had the largest percentage housed in 
local facilities (62%). Local jails in Utah (59%), New Mexico 
(57%), Kentucky (56%), Tennessee (55%), Massachusetts (55%), and 
West Virginia (51%) also held more than half of their State's
inmates. Excluding States with integrated prison and jail 
systems, Missouri held the largest proportion of its inmates 
in its State prisons (75%), followed by Michigan (73%). 

An estimated 12% of black males in 
their late twenties were in prison or 
jail in 2005

When total incarceration rates are estimated separately by age 
group, black males in their twenties and thirties are found to 
have very high rates relative to other groups. Among the nearly 
2.2 million offenders incarcerated on June 30, 2005, an 
estimated 548,300 were black males between the ages of 20 and 
39. Of black non-Hispanic males age 25 to 29, 11.9% were in 
prison or jail, compared to 3.9% of Hispanic males and about 
1.7% of white males in the same age group. In general, the 
incarceration rates for black males of all ages were 5 to 7 
times greater than those for white males in the same age 
groups.

Female incarceration rates, though significantly lower than
male rates at every age, reveal similar racial and ethnic 
disparities. The incarceration rate for Black non-Hispanic 
females was 347 per 100,000 almost 22 times higher than the 
rate for Hispanic females (144 per 100,000) and 4 times
higher than the rate for white females (88 per 100,000).
These differences among white, black, and Hispanic females 
were consistent across all age groups. 

Black incarceration rate highest in 
South Dakota; Hispanic rate highest 
in Pennsylvania

When incarceration rates by State (excluding Federal inmates) 
are estimated separately by gender, race, and Hispanic origin, 
male rates are found to be 10 times higher than female rates;
black rates 5® times higher than white rates; and Hispanic
rates nearly 2 times higher than white rates. The largest 
differences in incarceration rates between men and women are 
in New York (16® times higher for men) and Rhode Island (16
times higher for men). The largest differences in rates 
between whites and blacks are in Iowa (14 times higher for 
blacks) and Connecticut, New Jersey, and Vermont (more than 
12 times higher for blacks), and between whites and Hispanics 
in Connecticut and Massachusetts (more than 6 times higher for
Hispanics).

South Dakota led the Nation with an estimated 4,710 black
prison and jail inmates per 100,000 black State residents, 
followed by Wisconsin (4,416), and Iowa (4,200). Pennsylvania 
with 1,714 Hispanic inmates per 100,000 Hispanic residents, 
Idaho (1,654), and Connecticut (1,401) had the highest Hispanic 
incarceration rates.

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), with the U.S. Census
Bureau as its collection agent, obtains yearend and midyear 
counts of prisoners from departments of correction in each 
of the 50 States and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 

The National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) distinguishes
prisoners in custody from those under jurisdiction. To 
have custody of a prisoner, a State must hold that person 
in one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction means that 
a State has legal authority over the prisoner. Prisoners 
under a State's jurisdiction may be in the custody of a 
local jail, another State's prison, or other correctional 
facility. Some States are unable to provide both custody 
and jurisdiction counts. 

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in locally
administered confinement facilities who are under the 
jurisdiction of local authorities. NPS counts include all 
inmates in State-operated facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, 
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which have 
combined jail-prison systems. NPS excludes inmates held by 
the District of Columbia (DC), which as of yearend 2001 
operated only a jail system. (See National Prisoner
Statistics jurisdiction notes, page 13, appended to the
report in portable document format(pdf) on the BJS website

Census of Jail Inmates, 2005

The 2005 Census of Jail Inmates was the eighth in a series.
Previous censuses of jails were conducted in 1970, 1972, 
1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1999. To reduce respondent burden 
and improve data quality and timeliness, the census was split
into two parts: the Census of Jail Inmates, 2005, and the 
Census of Jail Facilities, 2006, (to be conducted on March 31, 
2006). As in previous censuses, the U.S. Census Bureau was the
collection agent for BJS.

The 2005 Census of Jail Inmates included all locally 
administered confinement facilities (under the authority 
of 2,853 local jurisdictions). These facilities are 
intended for adults but sometimes hold juveniles. They 
hold inmates beyond arraignment and are staffed by municipal 
or county employees. The census also included 42 jails that 
were privately operated under contract for local governments 
and 65 multi-jurisdiction jails that were administered by 
two or more local governments. Included in the census, but 
excluded from this report due to lack of comparability
with previous survey years, were 13 facilities maintained 
by the Federal Bureau of Prisons and functioning as jails. 

Excluded from the census were temporary holding facilities,
such as drunk tanks and police lockups, that do not hold 
persons after they are formally charged in court (usually 
within 72 hours of arrest). Also excluded were State-operated
facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode 
Island, and Vermont, which have combined jail-prison systems. 

Fourteen locally operated jails in Alaska were included. 

All jail jurisdictions responded to the census, resulting in
a 100% response rate.
