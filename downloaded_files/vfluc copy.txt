Highlights

* From 1990 to 2002, 18% of felony convictions in 
the 75 largest counties were for violent offenses, 
including 7% for assault and 6% for robbery. 

* Six percent of those convicted of violent felonies 
were under age 18, and 25% were under age 21. Ten 
percent of murderers were under 18, and 30% were 
under 21.

* Thirty-six percent of violent felons had an active 
criminal justice status at the time of their arrest. 
This included 18% on probation, 12% on release 
pending disposition of a prior case, and 7% on 
parole.

* Seventy percent of violent felons had a prior arrest 
record, and 57% had at least one prior arrest for a 
felony. Sixty-seven percent of murderers and 73% of 
those convicted of robbery or assault had an arrest 
record.

* A majority (56%) of violent felons had a prior 
conviction record. Thirty-eight percent had a prior 
felony conviction and 15% had a previous conviction 
for a violent felony. 

* Forty-one percent of murder convictions occurred 
at a trial rather than through a guilty plea. Trial 
convictions accounted for 12% of rape and robbery 
convictions and 11% of assault convictions. 

* Eighty-one percent of violent felons were sentenced 
to incarceration with 50% going to prison and 31% 
to jail. Nineteen percent received a probation term 
without incarceration.

* Median prison sentences received included a maximum 
of 240 months for murder, 120 months for rape, 60 
months for robbery, and 48 months for other violent 
felonies.
-----------------------------------------------

Convicted violent felons are among the most serious 
offenders in the criminal justice system. They are 
convicted of violent offenses, such as murder, rape, 
robbery, and assault, and given the most severe 
sanctions. A BJS analysis of felony convictions in 
the 75 most populous counties found that a majority 
of those committing violent felonies had–-
    
* multiple prior arrests

* at least 1 prior felony arrest

* at least 1 prior conviction.

Additionally, the analyses found that most convicted 
violent felons were --   

* detained from arrest through conviction

* sentenced to incarceration upon conviction

* sentenced to a prison term of 10 years or more if 
convicted of murder or rape.

These findings are based on data from the BJS State 
Court Processing Statistics (SCPS) program. The multi-
year SCPS dataset includes a sample of felony cases 
filed during selected months in the 75 largest counties 
from 1990 through 2002. About half of all reported
 violent crimes nationwide occur in these counties. 
In 2002 these counties accounted for --
 
* 61% of robberies

* 51% of murders and non-negligent manslaughters

* 47% of aggravated assaults 

* 36% of forcible rapes.

This report presents data on approximately 9,000 
persons convicted of committing violent felonies.  
When weighted, these cases represent about 33,000 
violent felons including --  

* 12,950 (39.5%) convicted of aggravated assault 

* 10,120 (30.9%) convicted of robbery

* 1,987 (6.1%) convicted of rape

* 1,077 (3.3%) convicted of murder or non-negligent
manslaughter

* 6,650 (20.3%) convicted of other violent felonies.

The full SCPS dataset used for this report included 
a sample of 103,000 felony cases. These cases 
represent about 386,000 defendants when weighted 
according to the sample design(see Methodology on 
page 9). About 180,000 of these defendants were 
convicted of a felony and 18.2% of these were 
convicted of a violent felony. 

Of the total number of felony convictions, 7.2% 
were for assault, 5.6% for robbery, 1.1% for rape, 
and 0.6% for murder, including nonnegligent manslaughter. 
An additional 3.7% were for other violent felonies 
such as involuntary manslaughter, negligent homicide, 
and kidnaping (see Methodology for offense category 
definitions).

Demographic characteristics 

Gender

Overall, 91% of violent felons in the 75 largest 
counties were male, ranging from 89% of those 
convicted of felony assault to 99% of convicted 
rapists. Ninety-three percent of convicted robbers 
and 91% of convicted murderers were male.

Age

Six percent of violent felons were under age 18 at 
the time of their arrest, and 25% were under age 21. 
Fourteen percent were 40 years or older. The mean age 
was 29.

Half of convicted murderers were younger than 25; 
30% were under age 21 and 10% were under 18. Twelve 
percent were at least 40 years old. The mean age 
for those convicted of murder was 27.

A third of rapists were under age 25: 18% were 
under 21 and 4% were under 18. Nineteen percent 
were 40 or older. The mean age of those convicted 
of rape was 31.

A majority (56%) of robbers were under the age of 
25. About 3 in 8 were under the age of 21 and 1 in 
8 were under 18. Six percent were 40 years or older.

Among those convicted of assault, 4% were under 18, 
22% under 21, and 40% under 25. Sixteen percent were 
40 or older, and the mean age was 29.

Race and ethnicity

Forty-one percent of violent felons were black, non-
Hispanic , 30% were Hispanic, and 26% were white, 
non-Hispanic. Blacks (46%) comprised a higher 
percentage of murderers than Hispanics (27%) or 
whites (23%).

Whites(37%)and blacks(35%)accounted for higher 
percentages of rapists than Hispanics (23%). Blacks 
accounted for 54% of robbers, twice the percentage 
of Hispanics(27%)and about 3 times that of whites 
(17%).

Blacks (39%) accounted for about two-fifths of those 
convicted of felony assault, compared to about a third 
who were Hispanic (32%), and a fourth who were white 
(26%).

Blacks (55%) comprised a majority of the violent 
felons who were under age 18. Blacks accounted for 
about two-fifths of the total in each age category 
from 21 through 34. 

Whites accounted for 13% of the violent felons under 
age 18. The percentage of whites rose in each successive 
age category, and was about the same as for blacks in 
the 35 to 39 age category, and slightly higher in the 
40 or older category.

Hispanics accounted for 30% of violent felons under 
age 18, and about a third in each age group from 18 
to 29. The percentage of Hispanics was lower than 
that for both blacks and whites in the 35 and older 
age categories.

Criminal history

Criminal justice status at arrest

More than a third (36%) of violent felons had at 
least one type of active criminal justice status when 
arrested. Eighteen percent were on probation, 12% had 
been released pending disposition of a prior case, and 
7% were on parole when arrested.

Robbers(45%)were the most likely to have had a criminal 
justice status at the time of arrest. An estimated 20% 
were on probation, 17% had been released pending 
disposition of a prior case, and 11% were on parole.

Those convicted of murder(36%)or felony assault(35%)
were the next most likely to have had an active 
criminal justice status when arrested. Fifteen 
percent of murderers were on probation, 13% were 
on pretrial release, and 8% were on parole. Nineteen 
percent of those later convicted of assault were on 
probation when arrested, 11% on pretrial release, 
and 6% on parole. 

Rapists (23%) were the least likely among violent 
felons to have a criminal justice status when arrested. 
Ten percent were on probation, 6% were on pretrial 
release, and 6% were on parole at the time of their 
arrest.

Prior arrests

An estimated 70% of violent felons in the 75 
largest counties had been arrested previously. 
Seventy-three percent of those convicted of robbery 
or assault had an arrest record, as did 67% of 
murderers, and 53% of rapists. 

Sixty percent of violent felons had multiple prior 
arrest charges, including 40% with 5 or more, and 
23% with 10 or more. About a fourth of those 
convicted of robbery (26%) or assault (24%)had 10 
or more prior arrest charges, as did about a fifth 
of murderers (21%) and a tenth of rapists (10%).

A majority (57%) of violent felons had been arrested 
previously for a felony. The percentage with a 
felony arrest record ranged from 40% of rapists to 
63% of robbers. Fifty-nine percent of those 
convicted of assault and 58% of those convicted of 
murder had at least one prior felony arrest. 

Forty-four percent of violent felons had more than 
one prior felony arrest charge, and 22% had at least 
five. 

About half of those convicted of robbery (51%)had 
more than one prior felony arrest, as did nearly 
half of those convicted of assault(46%)or murder 
(44%). 

Twenty-eight percent of robbers had 5 or more prior 
felony arrest charges and 12% had at least 10. Among 
murderers, 21% had 5 or more prior felony arrest 
charges, and 10% had 10 or more. Rapists (12%) were 
least likely to have five or more prior felony arrest 
charges.

Prior convictions

Fifty-six percent of convicted violent felons in 
the 75 largest counties had been previously 
convicted of a felony or misdemeanor. About three-
fifths of those convicted of assault(60%)or robbery 
(59%) had at least one prior conviction. More than 
half of murderers (53%) had a conviction record as 
well. Rapists (42%) were the least likely to have 
already had a conviction record.

Three-fourths of the violent felons with a prior 
conviction record had been convicted on more than 
one charge. This included 21% with 5 or more prior
convictions, and 7% with 10 or more.

Nearly half of those whose current conviction was 
for assault (46%) or robbery (45%) had multiple 
prior convictions. An estimated 39% of murderers
and 29% of rapists had more than one prior 
conviction. 

Twenty-three percent of those convicted of robbery 
or assault had five or more prior convictions, 
about twice the percentage among murderers(13%)and 
rapists (11%). 

About 3 in 8 violent felons had at least one prior
conviction for a felony (38%). This included 43% 
of robbers, 40% of those convicted of assault,
and 38% of murderers. Rapists (27%) and those 
convicted of other violent felonies (29%)were less 
likely to have already had a felony conviction. 

Twenty-three percent of violent felons had more 
than one prior conviction for a felony, with
robbers(27%)about twice as likely as rapists(14%) 
to have such a conviction record. Nearly a fourth 
of those convicted of assault(23%)or murder(23%)
had multiple prior felony convictions. Five percent 
of violent felons had been convicted on five or 
more prior felony charges, including 7% of robbers.

Fifteen percent of those convicted of a violent 
felony during the current study had at least one
prior conviction for a violent felony. For 22% of
violent felons, the most serious prior conviction 
was a nonviolent felony, and for 19% a misdemeanor.

Pretrial release and detention

An estimated 38% of violent felons were released 
from custody pending disposition of the case
that resulted in their conviction. Fifty percent
were held on bail, and 11% were denied bail. 

Among violent felons who had a bail amount set, 
about two-thirds were released when their bail
was set at under $5,000, compared to just 4% when 
it was set at $100,000 or more.

About three-fourths (73%) of those eventually 
convicted of murder were denied bail or had their
bail set at $100,000 or more. One of these
conditions was applied to less than a fourth of 
other violent felons. 

As a result of these bail conditions, murderers 
(12%) had the lowest rate of pretrial release.
About two-fifths of those eventually convicted of 
assault (43%) or rape (38%) were released prior to 
case disposition, compared to about a fourth (28%)
of those eventually convicted of robbery. (See 
Felony Defendants in Large Urban Counties, 2002 at
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/fdluc02.htm> 
for more information on pretrial release.)

Pretrial misconduct

About 1 in 4 released violent felons committed one 
or more types of misconduct while in a release 
status. This misconduct usually involved a rearrest 
for a new offense (14%) or a failure to appear in 
court (13%). 

Thirty-five percent of those eventually convicted 
of robbery were charged with pretrial misconduct. 
This included 24% rearrested for a new offense
and 18% who failed to appear in court. Misconduct 
rates were next highest for those eventually 
convicted of assault (23%). The rate was 17% for 
murderers and 14% for rapists.

Adjudication

Eighty-eight percent of violent felons were convicted
through a guilty plea and 12% at trial. About two-
thirds of trial convictions resulted from jury 
verdicts. The other third occurred as bench trials 
where the verdict was determined by a judge.

Murder convictions (41%) were much more likely to 
occur at a trial than convictions for rape (12%), 
robbery (12%), assault (11%), or other violent
felonies (8%). This was consistent with the
greater likelihood of murder defendants (44%) 
going to trial than defendants charged with other
violent felonies (6%). (See Felony Defendants in 
Large Urban Counties, 2002 at
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/fdluc02.htm> 
for more information on the adjudication of felony 
defendants.) 

At the time of conviction, 59% of violent felons 
were represented by a public defender, 21% by a
private attorney, and 20% had legal representation 
assigned by the court. Murder (44%) and rape (46%) 
defendants were less likely to have a public 
defender than other violent felons (60%). Robbery 
defendants (16%) were the least likely to have a 
private attorney. 

Violent felons who pled guilty (60%)were more likely 
to have a public defender than those convicted at 
trial(49%). Assigned counsel and private attorneys 
were each used in about a fourth of trials and about 
a fifth of cases involving guilty pleas.

Sentencing

Eighty-one percent of violent felons in the 75 
largest counties were sentenced to incarceration. 
Half were sentenced to State prison and about a
third to a local jail (31%). Nearly all murder 
convictions (96%) resulted in a prison sentence.
About two-thirds of sentences for robbery (69%) or 
rape (62%) convictions were to prison and about a 
fifth were to jail. Felony convictions for assault 
resulted in equal percentages of jail and prison 
sentences (38%). 

The mean prison sentence for a violent felony 
conviction was 105 months and the median was 60
months. Mean prison sentences ranged from about
26 years for murder to about 61/2 years for assault. 

Median prison sentences were 20 years for murder, 
10 years for rape, 5 years for robbery and 4
years for assault and other violent felonies. Two 
percent of violent felons received a life sentence
including 22% of murderers and 4% of those convicted 
of rape. Seventy-five percent of murder sentences 
were either to a term greater than 10 years or to
life.

Among the 31% of violent felons who received a jail
sentence, the mean sentence was 8 months and the 
median was 6 months. 

About a third of all jail sentences were for 10 
months or longer, including 4% for more than 1 
year.

Among the 19% of violent felons who were sentenced 
to probation without incarceration, 7% received a 
probation term that exceeded 5 years. The mean 
probation sentence was 42 months and the median was 
36 months. 

When all sentences are considered, including those 
not involving prison or jail, the mean amount of 
incarceration received for violent felony 
convictions in the 75 largest counties was about 23
years for murderers, about 8 years for rapists, and 
about 6 years for robbers. For assault convictions, 
the overall mean amount of incarceration received was 
about 3 years, and for other violent felonies it was 
about 21/2 years.

The median amount of incarceration received at 
sentencing was 16 years for murderers, 4 years for 
rapists, and about 3 years for robbers. The overall
median amount of incarceration received was less 
than 1 year for those convicted of assault (9
months) or other violent felonies (7 months).

Methodology

Sample design

The SCPS sample is a 2-stage stratified sample, 
with 40 of the 75 most populous counties
selected at stage one and a systematic sample of 
State court felony filings (defendants) within
each county selected at stage two. The 40 counties 
were divided into 4 first-stage strata based on
court filings. 

The second-stage sampling (filings) was designed to
represent all defendants who had felony cases filed 
with the court during the selected month. The
participating jurisdictions provided data for every 
felony case filed on selected days during that
month. Depending on the first-stage stratum in which 
it had been placed, each jurisdiction provided filings 
data for 5, 10, or 20 randomly selected business days 
in May. Data from jurisdictions that were not required 
to provide a full month of filings were weighted to 
represent the full month. (See the individual reports 
in the Felony Defendants in Large Urban Counties
series for sampling information specific to each year 
of the data collection <http://www.ojp.
usdoj.gov/bjs/pubalp2.htm#fdluc>.)

Because the data came from a sample, a sampling 
error is associated with each reported number.
In general, if the difference between two numbers 
is greater than twice the standard error for that
difference, we can say that we are 95% confident 
of a real difference and that the apparent
difference is not simply the result of using a 
sample rather than the entire population.

Standard errors may be used to construct confidence
intervals around any percentage. For example, if the 
standard error for the percentage of violent felons 
sentenced to prison is 1.3%, then the 95% confidence 
interval is approximately 50% plus or minus 1.96 
times 1.3% (or 47.4% to 52.6%).

Offense categories

Felony offenses were classified into 18 categories 
for this report. These were further classified
into the four major crime categories of violent, 
property, drug, and public-order. The following
listings are a representative summary of the crimes 
in the violent category; however, these lists are 
not meant to be exhaustive. All offenses, except for
murder, include attempts and conspiracies to commit. 

Murder -- Includes homicide, nonnegligent 
manslaughter, and voluntary homicide. Excludes
attempted murder (classified as felony assault), 
negligent homicide, involuntary homicide, or
vehicular manslaughter, which are classified as other
violent offenses.

Rape -- Includes forcible intercourse, sodomy, or 
penetration with a foreign object. Does not include 
statutory rape or nonforcible acts with a minor or
someone unable to give legal consent, nonviolent 
sexual offenses, or commercialized sex offenses.

Robbery -- Includes unlawful taking of anything of 
value by force or threat of force. Includes armed, 
unarmed, and aggravated robbery, carjacking, armed
burglary, and armed mugging.

Assault -- Includes aggravated assault, aggravated 
battery, attempted murder, assault with a deadly 
weapon, felony assault or battery on a law
enforcement officer, and other felony assaults.
Does not include extortion, coercion, or intimidation.

Other violent offenses -- Includes vehicular mans-
laughter, involuntary manslaughter, negligent or
