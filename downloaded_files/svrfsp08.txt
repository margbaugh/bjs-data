Highlights
*************

Prevalence of sexual victimization

* An estimated 9.6% of former state prisoners reported one or
more incidents of sexual victimization during the most recent
period of incarceration in jail, prison, and post-release
community-treatment facility.

* Among all former state prisoners, 1.8% reported
experiencing one or more incidents while in a local jail,
7.5% while in a state prison, and 0.1% while in a
post-release community-treatment facility.  

* About 5.4% of former state prisoners reported an incident
that involved another inmate. An estimated 3.7% of former
prisoners said they were forced or pressured to have
nonconsensual sex with another inmate, including manual
stimulation and oral, anal, or vaginal penetration. 

* About 5.3% of former state prisoners reported an incident
that involved facility staff. An estimated 1.2% of former
prisoners reported that they unwillingly had sex or sexual
contact with facility staff, and 4.6% reported that they
"willingly" had sex or sexual contact with staff.

* Although the rate of sexual victimization in state prison
reported by former inmates (7.5%) was higher than the rate
reported by inmates in previous BJS surveys (4.8% in
2008-09), the difference may reflect longer exposure periods
(39.4 months and 7.9 months, respectively).

Coercion and physical injury 

* Among victims of inmate-on-inmate sexual violence, a
quarter had been physically held down or restrained, and a
quarter had been physically harmed or injured.

* Half of all victims of staff sexual misconduct said they
had been offered favors or special privileges; a third said
they had been persuaded or talked into it. 

* Approximately 16% of victims of unwilling sexual activity
with staff, compared to 2% of victims of "willing" sexual
activity, reported being physically injured by staff. 
 
Individual risk factors

* The rate of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization was at
least 3 times higher for females (13.7%) than males (4.2%).

* The rate of "willing" sexual activity with staff was higher
among males (4.8%) than females (2.6%), and the rate of
unwilling sexual activity was higher among females (2.5%)
than males (1.1%).

* Among heterosexual males, an estimated 3.5% reported being
sexually victimized by another inmate. In comparison, among
males who were bisexual, 34% reported being sexually
victimized by another inmate.  Among males who were
homosexual or gay, 39% reported being victimized by another
inmate.

* Female heterosexual inmates reported lower rates of
inmate-on-inmate victimization (13%) and staff sexual
misconduct (4%) than female bisexual inmates (18% and 8%,
respectively).
 
* Among female homosexual or lesbian inmates, the rate of
inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization was similar to that for
female heterosexual inmates (13%), while the rate of staff
sexual victimization was at least double (8%) that for female
heterosexual inmates (4%). 

* The rate of imate-on-inmate sexual victimization for males
was higher among non-Hispanic white inmates (5.9%) and
inmates of two or more races (9.5%) than non-Hispanic black
inmates (2.9%).

Among male former state prisoners, the rates of staff sexual
misconduct were higher for those of two or more races (11.3%)
and black non-Hispanics (6.5%) than for white non-Hispanics
(4.5%) and Hispanics (4.0%). 

* The rate of staff sexual misconduct was higher for male
inmates ages 20 to 24 (7.9%) than for male inmates ages 25 to
34 (5.2%), ages 35 to 44 (3.5%), and age 45 or older (2.0%). 

* Among female former state prisoners, rates of staff sexual
misconduct were lower for those ages 35 to 44 (3.1%) and age
45 or older (1.6%), compared to those ages 20 to 24 (6.7%).

* Most victims of staff sexual misconduct (87%) reported only
perpetrators of the opposite sex.

* Among victims of staff sexual misconduct, 79% were males
reporting sexual activity with female staff. An additional 5%
were males reporting sexual activity with both female and
male staff.

Facility characteristics

* Rates of sexual victimization did not vary among commonly
cited characteristics of facilities, including size of
facility, facility age, crowding, inmate-to-staff ratios, or
gender composition of staff.

* Among male former inmates, inmate-on-inmate and
staff-on-inmate victimization rates were higher in facilities
under a court order or consent decree, higher in facilities
reporting a major disturbance in the 12 months prior to the
most recent facility census, higher in facilities with medium
or greater security levels, and higher in facilities with a
primary function of housing general population than in
facilities without these characteristics.

* Among female former inmates, rates of inmate-on-inmate
victimization were lower in community corrections centers, in
facilities that permitted 50% or more of their inmates to
leave unaccompanied during the day, in minimum or low
security facilities, and in privately operated facilities
than in facilities without these characteristics.

* After controlling for multiple individual-level
characteristics 

**Inmate-on-inmate and staff-on-inmate victimization rates
among males were lower in reception and diagnostic centers
than in facilities that housed general population, and lower
in minimum security facilities than in facilities with higher
security levels. 

**Inmate-on-inmate victimization rates among females were
lower in facilities that permitted 50% or more of their
inmates to leave unaccompanied during the day than in other
confinement facilities, lower in medium security facilities
than in maximum or high security facilities, and higher in
facilities that had a major disturbance in the census year
than in facilities that did not.

Sexual victimization and its consequences

* Following their release from prison, 72% of victims of
inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization indicated they felt
shame or humiliation, and 56% said they felt guilt. 

* The majority of victims of staff sexual misconduct
involving unwilling activity said they felt shame or
humiliation (79%) and guilt (72%) following their release
from prison. More than half (54%) reported having difficulty
feeling close to friends or family members as a result of the
sexual victimization.

* Although the vast majority of victims of staff sexual
misconduct (86%) reported at least one incident that they
considered "willing," approximately a quarter said they felt
guilt (27%) or shame and humiliation (23%) after their
release from prison.

* Among former inmates who had been tested for HIV (90%),
those who had been sexually victimized by other inmates or by
staff had significantly higher percentages for HIV positive
(6.5% and 4.6%, respectively) than those who had not been
victimized (2.6%).

* Among former inmates under parole supervision, victims and
nonvictims did not differ in their current employment (64%
employed) or housing arrangements (92% in house, apartment,
trailer, or mobile home); however, victims (18%) were
somewhat more likely than nonvictims (14%) to be living
alone. 

Sexual Victimization Reported by Former State Prisoners, 2008

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducted the
first-ever National Former Prisoner Survey (NFPS) between
January 2008 and October 2008. NORC at the University of
Chicago, under a cooperative agreement with BJS, collected
the data. A total of 317 parole offices in 40 states were
randomly included in the survey sample. A total of 17,738
former state prisoners who were under active supervision
(i.e., required to contact a supervisory parole authority
regularly in person, by mail, or by telephone) participated
in the national survey. Interviews from an additional 788
former prisoners were included from the survey test sites.
These former inmates had been randomly selected from 16
offices sampled. Based on 18,526 completed interviews, the
survey achieved a 61% response rate. (See Methodology for
further details.)

The NFPS is part of the National Prison Rape Statistics
Program, which collects both administrative records of
reported sexual violence and allegations of sexual
victimization directly from victims. BJS has collected
administrative records annually since 2004. We collected
victim reports through surveys of adult inmates in prisons
and jails in the National Inmate Survey in 2007 (NIS-1) and
in 2008-09 (NIS-2) and through surveys of youth held in
juvenile correctional facilities in the National Survey of
Youth in Custody in 2008-09 (NSYC-1). 

The NFPS collects data on the totality of the prior term of
incarceration, including any time in a local jail, state
prison, or community correctional facility prior to final
discharge.  Because the survey is based on a sample of parole
offices and not a sample of prisons, the NFPS is not
conducive to providing facility estimates or rankings. The
NFPS is designed to encourage a fuller reporting of
victimization, by surveying only former inmates, who are not
subject to the immediate risk of retaliation from
perpetrators or a code of silence while in prison. The NFPS
may elicit reports of incidents that were unreported in the
previous NIS-1 and NIS-2 surveys of prisoners; however, some
reports may be untrue. At the same time, some former inmates
may remain silent about sexual victimization experienced
while incarcerated, despite efforts to assure victims that
their responses will be kept confidential. 

**************************************************
Other PREA data collections

The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA; P.L. 108-79)
requires the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to carry out,
for each calendar year, a comprehensive statistical review
and analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape. The
act further specifies that the review and analysis shall be
based on a random sample or other scientifically appropriate
sample of not less than 10% of all federal, state, and county
prisons and a representative sample of municipal prisons.  It
requires BJS to use surveys and other statistical studies of
current and former inmates. To fully meet these requirements,
BJS has developed a multiple measure, multi-mode data
collection strategy, in which the NFPS is one component.
                                   
National Survey of Youth in Custody (NSYC) provides
facility-level estimates of youth reporting sexual
victimization in juvenile facilities, as required under PREA.
The first NSYC (NSYC-1) was conducted in 2008-09; the second
(NSYC-2) is underway and will be completed by September 2012.
NSYC-2 will provide estimates for large facilities that house
adjudicated youth and for each of the 50 state systems and
the District of Columbia.

National Inmate Survey (NIS) gathers data on the incidence of
sexual assault in adult prisons and local jail facilities, as
reported by inmates. The first NIS (NIS-1) was conducted in
2007, the second (NIS-2) was conducted in 2008-09, and the
third (NIS-3) is underway and will be completed by May 2012.
Based on inmate allegations, the NIS provides facility-level
estimates used to rank facilities as required under PREA. 

Survey of Sexual Violence (SSV) collects data annually on the
incidence of sexual violence in adult and juvenile
correctional facilities. Based on administrative data only,
the SSV is limited to incidents reported to correctional
officials.  Begun in 2004, the SSV provides detailed
information on incidents that have been substantiated upon
investigation. 

Clinical Indicators of Sexual Violence in Custody (CISVC) In
2010 11, in collaboration with the National Institute of
Justice (NIJ) and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), BJS conducted a feasibility study using
medical indicators and medical surveillance methodologies. As
part of routine medical practice, medical staff in 19 prisons
and 11 jails completed a surveillance form for adult males
who either made an allegation of sexual violence or displayed
clinical conditions consistent with sexual victimization. 
Results of the 12-month pilot study are expected in 2012

Incidents of sexual victimization
**********************************

9.6% of former state prisoners reported one or more incidents
of sexual victimization during the most recent period of
incarceration in jail, prison, or a post-release
community-treatment facility

Among the 18,526 former state inmates participating in the
NFPS survey, 2,096 reported experiencing one or more
incidents of sexual victimization during their most recent
period of incarceration, including the combined time in local
jails, state prisons, or post-release community-treatment
facilities. Because the NFPS is a sample survey, weights were
applied to the sampled offices and offenders under their
supervision to produce national-level estimates. The
estimated number of former state prisoners experiencing
sexual victimization totaled 49,000, or 9.6% of all former
state prisoners under active supervision at midyear 2008
(table 1).

Among all former state prisoners, 1.8% reported experiencing
one or more incidents while in a local jail, 7.5% while in a
state prison, and 0.1% while in a post-release
community-treatment facility. An estimated 1.4% reported an
incident in a facility for which the type could not be
determined. 

5.4% of former inmates reported an incident with another
inmate; 5.3% reported an incident with staff

Among former state prisoners, 5.4% (or an estimated 27,300
prisoners nationwide at midyear 2008) reported an incident
that involved another inmate, and 5.3% (27,100) reported an
incident that involved facility staff. Some inmates (1.1%)
reported sexual victimization by both another inmate and
facility staff.

An estimated 3.7% of former prisoners said they had
nonconsensual sex with another inmate, including manual
stimulation and oral, anal, or vaginal penetration. An
additional 1.6% of former prisoners said they had experienced
one or more abusive sexual contacts only with another inmate,
including unwanted touching of the inmate's buttocks, thigh,
penis, breast, or vagina in a sexual way.

An estimated 1.2% of former prisoners reported that they
unwillingly had sex or sexual contact with facility staff. An
estimated 4.6% said they "willingly" had sex or sexual
contact with staff.

**************************************************************
National Former Prisoner Survey Protocol


Active post-custody supervision

Only people who had served time in a state prison, were age
18 or older at the time of the survey, and under active
post-release supervision were eligible to be part of the
NFPS. The survey includes some people who were under age 18
at the time of their incarceration. These people were
sentenced as adults and served time in adult facilities.

In 2008, approximately 85% of all persons under some form of
post-custody supervision were considered to be under active
supervision. Individuals who were ineligible for the survey
included those who had absconded, were re-incarcerated, were
in a halfway house or community-based treatment center, had a
warrant issued for their arrest, were in violator status, or
had been transferred to another parole office. Persons under
supervision in small offices (under 40 parolees) in remote
areas or in specialty offices (e.g., sex offender supervision
or treatment facilities) were also excluded from the survey.
Overall, the NFPS is a representative sample of approximately
510,800 former state prisoners under supervision at midyear
2008. (See Methodology for sampling information.)

Audio computer-assisted self-interview

The NFPS interviews, which averaged 23 minutes in length,
were conducted using computer-assisted personal interviewing
(CAPI) and audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI)
data collection methods. Survey interviewers initiated the
personal interview using CAPI to obtain demographic and
criminal history information. For the remainder of the
interview, respondents interacted with a
computer-administered questionnaire using a touch-screen and
synchronized audio instructions delivered via headphones.
Respondents completed the survey in private at the parole
office (or satellite office), with the interviewer in the
room but unable to see the computer screen. (See Methodology
for further description of the survey protocol.)

Voluntary participation with incentives

Before the interview, respondents were informed verbally and
in writing that participation was voluntary and that all
information provided would be held in confidence.  They were
also informed that if they agreed to participate, they would
receive $50 as a token of appreciation for participating in
the survey.  A second automated consent protocol was
administered at the beginning of the ACASI portion of the
interview to confirm that the respondent had been properly
informed that participating in the survey was voluntary and
that they were "ready to continue with the interview."

Measuring sexual victimization

The NFPS first screened for inmate-on-inmate sexual touching
"when they didn't want this to happen" and sexual activity
"in which they did not want to participate." Respondents were
then asked about the specific sexual activity, including
oral, anal, or vaginal penetration, and about the specific
contact, including touching of buttocks, thighs, breasts,
penis, or vagina in an attempt to hurt or arouse the victim
or the perpetrator. (See appendix A and B for specific survey
questions.) Reports of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization
were classified as either nonconsensual sexual acts or
abusive sexual contacts.

The NFPS also asked about staff sexual activity, including
staff sexually harrassing the inmate, staring inappropriately
at the inmate, and forcing the inmate to undress or brushing
private parts when "it was not required by their job." Former
inmates were then screened for sexual contact with staff,
"whether it was willing or not," or "whether you wanted to
have it or not." These contacts may have included oral, anal,
or vaginal penetration and other forms of sexual stimulation
through rubbing the penis and touching other private parts.
(See appendix C and D for specific survey questions.)
 
Reports of staff sexual misconduct involving physical force,
threat of force, fear of bodily injury, and being pressured
or made to feel they had no choice were classified as
"unwilling." Other reports of staff sexual misconduct in
which former inmates reported willingly having sex or sexual
contact with staff were classified as "willing" even though
any sex or sexual contact between inmates and staff is
illegal. (See Definition of terms on page 13.)

**************************************************************

Former prisoners reported a wide variety of other sexual
experiences with staff that were inappropriate:

* An estimated 8.9% reported that staff had hassled or
harassed them in a sexual way.

* 27.9% said that staff had stared or watched them at
inappropriate times (e.g., while the inmate was dressing or
taking a shower). 

* 13.5% said that staff had forced them to undress in their
presence or had brushed against their private parts when
"they did not think it was an accident or it was not required
by their job."

Nearly a third (32.4%) of all former inmates reported one or
more of these types of experiences. While inappropriate,
these lesser forms of staff sexual misconduct were not
included in the analysis unless combined with reports of
"willingly" or unwillingly having sex or sexual contact with
staff. (See appendix D for survey items related to
staff-on-inmate sexual victimization.)

Few former inmates reported experiencing sexual victimization
while in a community-based correctional facility

Correctional facilities are typically classified as
community-based if 50% or more of the residents are regularly
permitted to leave unaccompanied by facility staff to work or
study in the community. Community-based facilities include
entities such as halfway houses, residential treatment
centers, restitution centers, and pre-release centers.
Although community-based correctional facilities are covered
by the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), little data have
been available on the rate of sexual victimization in these
facilities. Despite the large number of such facilities (529
of the 1,719 state correctional facilities in 2005), they
hold few inmates on any single day (54,233 inmates at yearend
2005, or approximately 4% of all state inmates held
nationwide) (See Census of State and Federal Correctional
Facilities, 2005, October 2008, BJS Web, NCJ 222182, appendix
tables 2 and 10.) As a result of their small size (an average
of 102 inmates per facility) and the relatively short length
of stay for most inmates while in community-based facilities,
inmates held in these facilities have been excluded from
previous PREA-related inmate surveys.

The NFPS provides the first systematic data available on
sexual victimization in community-based facilities. An
estimated 66,400 former state prisoners (13%) said they had
served some time in a community-based treatment facility or
halfway house after release from prison. Among those inmates
who had served time in such a facility, 0.9% reported
experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization
while in the facility (table 2). Among all former state
prisoners, 0.1% said they had been sexually victimized while
in a post-release community-treatment facility.
Approximately 65,500 former inmates (13%) reported spending
time in a community-based facility before their release from
prison. During the time they had been placed in such a
facility, 2.0% reported experiencing one or more incidents of
sexual victimization: 0.7% reported inmate-on-inmate sexual
victimization, while 1.4% reported staff-on-inmate
victimization.

Sexual victimization rates differed from those previously
reported in the NIS-1 and NIS-2 

The rate of sexual victimization reported by former state
prisoners (9.6%) was substantially higher than the rates
reported in the previous BJS National Inmate Surveys which
were based on confined state and federal inmates (e.g., 4.5%
in the NIS-1 conducted in 2007 and 4.4% in the NIS-2
conducted in 2008-09). The differences may largely reflect
longer average exposure time among former inmates. 

Unlike NFPS, the NIS-1 and NIS-2 provide facility-specific
estimates of the prevalence of sexual victimization. As
required under the PREA of 2003, these surveys are designed
to provide a list of prisons and jails ranked by the
prevalence of sexual victimization. To eliminate experiences
that may have occurred in other facilities or in the distant
past and to control for the varying length of stay, the NIS-1
and NIS-2 asked inmates to provide the most recent date of
admission to the current facility. To provide comparative
rates, if the date of admission was at least 12 months prior
to the date of the interview, inmates were asked questions
related to their experiences during the past 12 months. If
the admission date was less than 12 months prior to the
interview, inmates were asked about their experiences since
they arrived at the facility. 

As a consequence, the average exposure period among state
prisoners participating in the NIS-2 was 7.9 months, compared
to the average of 39.4 months that the former inmates in the
NFPS had served in state prisons prior to their release
(excluding time served in a local jail or post-release
community-treatment facility). (See Methodology for
differences in coverage between NFPS and NIS.)

**********************************************************
Criminal history and supervision profile of former inmates

In addition to collecting data on the sexual experiences of
former state inmates during their most recent period of
confinement, the NFPS gathered information on their criminal
histories and their current supervision (table 3). Results
from the survey include the following:

* Among former state inmates under active supervision, 47%
had been on parole or community supervision for less than 12
months, 24% for 12 to 23 months, 12% for 24 to 35 months, and
17% for 36 months or more.

* About a third of the former inmates under active parole
supervision had served time for a violent offense (33%) or a
drug offense (30%), a quarter for a property offense (25%),
and an eighth for a public-order offense (12%).

* Nearly 21% of the former inmates under active supervision
had served time for a probation violation; 21% for a parole
violation.  
  
* Nineteen percent of the former state prison inmates had
served less than 12 months in prison or jail before their
release from prison; 25% had served 12 to 23 months; 16%, 24
to 35 months; 17%, 36 to 59 months; and 23%, 60 months or
more.

* More than half of those under supervision (56%) had been
released as a result of a parole board decision.

* As a condition of their release, more than 90% of the
parolees were required to submit to drug testing; 78% were
required to be employed. 

* Participation in a treatment or counseling program was also
required of 53% of the parolees for drugs; 39% for alcohol;
and 26% for issues other than drugs or alcohol. 

* Nearly 80% of parolees said they had a face-to-face meeting
in the last month with their parole officer in the parole
office; 57% said they had a face-to-face meeting outside of
the office (at home, at work, or elsewhere); and 48% said
they had been contacted by mail, e-mail, or telephone.

****************************************************************

**************************************
Type of coercion and physical injury
**************************************
  
Among victims of inmate-on-inmate sexual violence, a quarter
had been physically held down or restrained and a quarter had
been physically harmed or injured 
  
Incidents of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization involved a
wide array of acts with differing levels of coercion and
force to get the victim to participate. Although many of the
victims were not raped, all of the victims had been sexually
abused. 

Force or threat of force or harm was reported by 59% of
victims of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization about 3.2%
of former state prisoners overall (not shown in table). An
estimated 53% said they had been threatened with harm or a
weapon; 28% had been physically held down or restrained, and
25% had been physically harmed or injured. (table 4).

The most common form of coercion other than force or threat
of force was being "persuaded or being talked into it" (34%)
against their will. A quarter of victims (26%) said the
inmate perpetrator had given them a bribe or blackmailed
them, and a quarter (24%) said they had been offered or given
protection from other inmates. In addition, some victims had
been given drugs or alcohol to get them drunk or high (9%),
and some had sexual contact to pay off or settle a debt that
they owed (8%). Overall, 52% of victims reported one or more
of these types of coercion.

Among victims of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization, the
most common injuries were anal or vaginal tearing, severe
pain or bleeding (12%) and chipped or lost teeth (12%).
Although 29% of all victims reported bruises, black eyes,
sprains, cuts, scratches, swelling, or welts from one or more
incidents involving another inmate, nearly a quarter (23%)
also reported more serious injuries

Half of victims of staff sexual misconduct said they had been
offered favors or special privileges; a third had been
persuaded or talked into it; a quarter had been bribed or
blackmailed

Most victims of staff sexual misconduct said they "willingly"
had sex or sexual contact with staff; however, many of these
victims also reported sexual contact or activity with staff
that involved some form of coercion. Among the estimated
23,300 former prisoners who reported some type of "willing"
activity with staff, 11% (2,500) also reported unwilling
sexual activity with staff. The most common form of coercion
reported by the 23,300 "willing" victims was offers of favors
or special privileges by staff (49%), followed by being
persuaded or talked into it by staff (34%) and being given a
bribe or blackmailed (24%). Overall, 62% of inmates who had
engaged in "willing" sex or sexual activity with staff
reported some type of coercion or offer of favors, special
privileges, or protection by staff.

An estimated 6,300 former state prisoners (1.2%) reported
unwilling sexual activity with staff during their most recent
period of incarceration. These unwilling victims (48%) were
more likely than "willing" victims of staff sexual misconduct
(5%) to report having been physically forced or threatened by
staff. An estimated 44% of unwilling victims said they had
been threatened with harm or a weapon, 19% said they had been
physically held down, and 15% said they had been physically
harmed or injured. 

Nearly 7 of every 8 inmates who reported unwilling sexual
activity with staff said that staff had employed other forms
of coercion to engage them in sexual activities or have
sexual contact. In specific, 72% of the victims were offered
favors or special privileges, 72% were persuaded or talked
into it, 60% were given bribes or blackmailed, 34% were
offered protection from other staff, and 21% were given drugs
or alcohol.

These reports suggest that these former inmates experienced a
wide array of pressures from staff to have sexual contact
against their will. More than 80% of victims who reported
force and threat of force also reported one or more of these
other forms of coercion (not shown in table). 

Four percent of victims of staff sexual misconduct reported
that they were physically injured

Approximately 16% of victims of unwilling sexual activity
with staff, compared to 2% of victims of "willing" sexual
activity, reported being physically injured by staff. Among
victims of unwilling activity, the most commonly reported
injuries were bruises, black eyes, sprains, cuts, scratches,
swelling or welts (11.8%). Most of these victims of unwilling
sexual activity also reported more serious injuries,
including anal or vaginal tearing (8.8%), loss or chipping of
teeth (6.3%), and receiving internal injuries (4.9%). Though
few victims of "willing" sexual activity with staff reported
being injured, some (1.6%) reported a serious injury.

***********************************************************

Definition of terms 

Sexual victimization all types of unwanted sexual activity
with other inmates (e.g., oral, anal, or vaginal penetration,
hand jobs, or touching of the inmate's buttocks, thighs,
penis, breasts, or vagina in a sexual way), abusive sexual
contacts with other inmates, and both willing and unwilling
sexual activity with staff.

Nonconsensual sexual acts unwanted contact with another
inmate or any contact with staff that involved oral, anal,
vaginal penetration, hand jobs, and other sexual acts.

Abusive sexual contacts only unwanted contact with another
inmate or any contact with staff that involved touching of
the inmate's buttocks, thighs, penis, breasts, or vagina in a
sexual way.

Unwilling activity incidents of unwanted sexual contact with
another inmate or staff.

Willing activity incidents of willing sexual contacts with
staff. These contacts are characterized by the reporting
inmates as willing; however, all sexual contacts between
inmates and staff are legally nonconsensual.

Staff sexual misconduct all incidents of willing and
unwilling sexual contact with facility staff, and all
incidents of sexual activity that involved oral, anal or
vaginal penetration, hand jobs, and other sexual acts with
facility staff.

*********************************************************

***************************************
Circumstances surrounding victimization
***************************************

Inmate-on-inmate victimization occurred most often in the
victim's cell; staff-on-inmate victimization occurred most
often in a closet, office, or other locked room
In the NFPS victims were asked to provide additional
information about the circumstances surrounding their
victimization, including the number of times it had happened,
the number of different perpetrators, when each incident
occurred, and where it occurred in each facility.

Data provided by inmates who reported sexual victimization by
another inmate revealed that 

* Victimization was more common in the evening (between 6
p.m. and midnight) (52%) than at any other time (table 5).
* Almost two-thirds (62%) of the victims said at least one
incident took place in their cell or room, and a quarter said
an incident took place in another inmate's cell or room
(24%).

* An estimated 46% of inmate-on-inmate victims had been
victimized by more than one perpetrator.
About 42% had been victimized once; 31% had been victimized 3
or more times.

Most victims (86%) of staff sexual misconduct reported more
than one incident; 47% reported more than one perpetrator
Data provided by inmates who had been sexually victimized by
facility staff also revealed that 

* Reports of staff sexual misconduct were more common between
midnight and 6 a.m. (54%) than at any other time.

* More than two-thirds (70%) of the victims said at least one
incident had occurred in a closet, office, or other locked
room; half (54%) of the victims said an incident had occurred
in a work area; and a third (35%) in a shower or bathroom.

* Reports of when and where incidents had occurred were
similar among willing and unwilling victims.

***************************************
Variations by sex of former inmates
***************************************

Past BJS surveys of confined prison inmates have consistently
found higher rates of inmate-on-inmate victimization among
females than males. In the National Inmate Survey, 2008-09,
4.7% of the surveyed female inmates and 1.9% of the male
inmates reported being sexually victimized by another inmate.
This difference was found to be statistically independent and
largely unexplained by covariation with other demographic
characteristics (e.g., an inmate's race or Hispanic origin,
age, education, marital status, and weight). (See Sexual
Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates,
2008-09, tables 6 and 7.) The reports of former prisoners
confirm the large and statistically significant difference
between male and female rates of inmate-on-inmate sexual
victimization (table 6). 

The rate of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization among
former state prisoners was 3 times higher among females
(13.7%) than males (4.2%)

When the rate of sexual victimization was limited to
nonconsensual sexual acts including only incidents of manual
stimulation and oral, anal, or vaginal penetration, the
difference between females and males was large. An estimated
10.5% of females reported such incidents with other inmates,
compared to 2.7% of males. 

The rate of "willing" sexual activity with staff was higher
among males (4.8%) than females (2.6%), and the rate of
unwilling sexual activity was higher among females (2.5%)
than males (1.1%)

Most victims of staff sexual misconduct (87%) reported only
perpetrators of the opposite sex (table 7). Same-sex
victimization was more likely to be reported by victims of
unwilling staff sexual misconduct than by victims of
"willing." Approximately a quarter of the reports of
unwilling sexual activity with staff involved male inmates
with male staff only (23%) and female inmates with female
staff only (3%).

****************************************************
Variations by other individual-level characteristics
****************************************************

Large differences in sexual victimization were found among
former inmates based on their sexual orientation

An estimated 3.5% of male heterosexual former inmates
reported being sexually victimized by another inmate, and
5.2% reported being victimized by staff (table 8). In
comparison, 34% of male inmates who were bisexual reported
being sexually victimized by another inmate, and 18% reported
being sexually victimized by staff. Thirty-nine percent of
male inmates who were homosexual or gay indicated they had
been victimized by another inmate and 12% by staff.

* Bisexual female former inmates reported a higher rate of
inmate-on-inmate victimization (18%) than heterosexual
inmates (13%) and lesbian inmates (13%).

* Lesbian inmates and bisexual female former inmates had
rates of staff sexual misconduct that were at least double
(8%) the rate among heterosexual female former inmates.

Rates of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization among males
varied by race and Hispanic origin. Rates of inmate-on-inmate
victimization for males were higher among white non-Hispanic
inmates (5.9%) and multi-racial inmates (9.5%) than among
black non-Hispanic inmates (2.9%). Among females, rates of
inmate-on-inmate victimization did not vary significantly
across other demographic characteristics.

Patterns of staff sexual misconduct among male former
prisoners varied among multiple demographic characteristics.
Rates of staff sexual misconduct were higher for those of two
or more races (11.3%) and lower for white non-Hispanic
inmates (4.5%) and Hispanic inmates (4.0%), when compared to
black non-Hispanic inmates (6.5%). Rates of staff sexual
misconduct were also higher among younger male inmates (under
age 25) than among older male inmates; higher among those
with less than a high school education than those who
completed high school; and higher for those who were married
than those who were widowed, divorced, separated, or never
married. 

Among female former prisoners, rates of staff sexual
misconduct were significantly lower among those ages 35 to 44
(3.1%) and age 45 or older (1.6%), compared to those ages 20
to 24 (6.7%). The only other statistically significant
difference among female inmates was that 11.9% of
multi-racial inmates reported staff sexual misconduct, which
was approximately 2 to 3 times the rate of victimization
reported by white non-Hispanic inmates (4.5%), black
non-Hispanic inmates (4.2%), and Hispanic inmates (3.8%).

Violent, male sex offenders reported high rates of
inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization (13.7%)

Consistent with findings in previous BJS data collections
based on inmates held in prisons and local jails, male former
state prisoners whose most serious offense was a violent sex
offense reported significantly higher rates of
inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization than other inmates
(table 9). The rate among male sex offenders (13.7%) was more
than twice the rate among other violent male offenders
(4.9%), 3 times the rate of property offenders (4.4%), 5
times the rate of public-order offenders (2.6%), and 6 times
the rate of drug offenders (2.0%). Among female former
inmates, no differences were found in rates of
inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization by type of offense for
which they had been sentenced.

Rates of sexual victimization increased with the length of
time that former inmates had served

Rates of sexual victimization by other inmates and staff
increased with the length of time the former inmate had
served during the most recent incarceration in jail, prison,
or post-release community-treatment facility. Among males,
rates for former inmates who had served 5 years or more were
at least 3 times higher than for those who had served less
than a year. Among males who had served 10 years or longer,
12% reported having been sexually victimized by other inmates
and 17% by staff. Among females who had served 5 to 10 years
before their release, 21% reported having been sexually
victimized by other inmates and 11% by staff. A quarter of
the females who had served 10 years or more reported
experiencing staff sexual misconduct.

Male inmates with no prior incarceration experience had a
higher rate of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization (6.6%)
compared to those with one or more prior incarcerations
(3.7%). Rates of staff sexual victimization for males and
rates for both inmate and staff sexual victimization for
females did not vary by prior incarceration history. 

Former state prisoners who had served time in 5 or more
facilities during their most recent confinement reported the
highest rates of staff sexual misconduct 

Staff sexual misconduct rates varied by the number of
facilities in which male and female inmates had served time
during their most recent period of incarceration.
Approximately 25% of the male former state prisoners and 10%
of the female state prisoners had served time in five or more
facilities before their release. These inmates reported
significantly higher rates of staff sexual misconduct (6.7%
or more among males and 7.7% or more among females) than
those who had served in three or fewer facilities (4.0% or
less among males and females). 

These differences are consistent with the practice of
transferring victims to other facilities in response to
substantiated incidents of staff sexual misconduct. In 2006,
based on reports by correctional authorities of all
substantiated incidents of sexual victimization, nearly a
third of the victims of staff sexual misconduct were
transferred to another facility 19% of victims in prisons and
48% of victims in jails. (For further details, see Sexual
Violence Reported by Correctional Authorities, 2006, April
2007, BJS Web, NCJ 218914, table 12.) The increase in sexual
victimization rates by number of facilities may also reflect
covariation with total time served, with inmates who serve
longer sentences being placed in more facilities.

Difference in findings after BJS performed multivariate
logistic regressions

Among male former prisoners, after controlling for the
effects of other individual-level factors 

* Inmate-on-inmate victimization was higher for white
non-Hispanic inmates, persons of two or more races, those age
24 or younger, non-heterosexuals, sex offenders, and those
who served 5 years or more than for inmates with other
characteristics (table 10)

Staff sexual misconduct was higher for black non-Hispanic
inmates, persons of two or more races, those age 24 or
younger, non-heterosexuals, those with one or more prior
incarcerations, and those who served 12 months or more than
for inmates with other characteristics.

Among female former prisoners, after controlling for the
effects of other individual-level factors 

* Inmate-on-inmate victimization was higher for inmates of
two or more races, those age 24 or younger, those with some
college education, those with one or more prior
incarcerations, and those who had served a year or more but
less than 10 years than for inmates with other
characteristics.

* Staff sexual misconduct was higher for white non-Hispanic
inmates, inmates of two or more races, those age 24 or
younger, those with one or more prior incarcerations, and
those who served 3 years or more than for inmates with other
characteristics.

* Sexual victimization either by other inmates or by staff
was unrelated to sexual orientation.

For both male and female former prisoners, the number of
facilities in which the inmate had served time was no longer
related to reports of staff sexual misconduct. For male
former inmates, education levels and marital status were no
longer correlated with reports of staff sexual victimization.

**************************************************************

BJS used multivariate logistic regression models to determine
which inmate characteristics were significant predictors of
whether the inmate would be sexually victimized in prison

Multivariate logistic regression estimation is a modeling
technique used to determine what characteristics are
statistically significant for predicting a dichotomous
outcome (e.g., an inmate is victimized or not victimized)
while controlling for all the other characteristics in the
model. 

BJS used this technique to determine which inmate
characteristics were statistically significant for predicting
sexual victimization. Based on four separate models, each
representing the type of sexual victimization and sex of the
former inmate, the variations in rates of sexual
victimization by demographic characteristic, sexual
orientation, and criminal justice status were found to be
largely statistically independent of one another.  

Estimates are displayed in terms of the conditional marginal
probabilities, which represent the probability that a former
male or female inmate with a particular characteristic has
experienced a specific sexual victimization outcome
conditional on the former inmate having the mean value for
all other predictors in the model. For example, based on
models with demographic and criminal justice status
characteristics only, a white male former inmate had a 4.0%
chance of having been sexually victimized by another inmate,
and a female former inmate had a 12.2% chance (conditional on
the inmate having the mean value on all of the other
characteristics in the model). For characteristics that are
categorical, which is the case for every variable in these
logistic regression models, the mean value is a weighted
value of the joint distribution of all other characteristics
in the respective model. (See Methodology for a discussion of
logistic regression

**************************************************************

****************************************************** 
Variations by selected facility-level characteristics 
******************************************************

To understand more fully the correlates of sexual
victimization and circumstances surrounding that
victimization, BJS included survey questions to identify each
of the state facilities in which the inmates had served time
during their most recent period of incarceration and asked if
the inmates had been sexually victimized (by type of
victimization) within each facility. (See appendix E for
specific survey questions.) Data collected in prior BJS
censuses of state prison facilities (conducted in 1990, 1995,
2000 and 2005) were linked to these reports to determine
whether any facility characteristics were associated with
variations in rates of sexual victimization. Although data on
local jails and post-release community-treatment facilities
were also collected, they have been excluded from this
analysis. (See Methodology for details on linkage of prison
census data.)

Three-quarters of former inmates had served time in more than
one prison facility; nearly 1 in 8 had served time in 5 or
more prison facilities before their release 

During their period of incarceration, inmates typically
served time in more than one facility. Covering only the last
continuous period of incarceration, the 18,526 former
prisoners interviewed in NFPS reported 63,813 separate
placements. Of these, 16,073 involved jail placements (either
prior to prison, as an interim stop or as the only placement
for some). In addition, 2,422 placements were to post-release
local facilities, and 1,525 were to out-of-state facilities.
When weighted by the inverse of the probability of selection,
the eligible prison-only placements represented more than 1.3
million separate placements (table 11).

Overall, an estimated 500,400 former prisoners (98%) had
served time in a prison facility in the state in which they
were currently under parole or post-custody supervision,
excluding 10,400 prisoners who had served time only in a
local jail. Approximately three-quarters of these inmates had
served time in more than one prison facility; nearly an
eighth had served time in five or more prison facilities.

Nearly 44% of male victims and 74% of female victims reported
that sexual victimization had occurred in the first prison
facility they had entered 

Based on the self reports of victims in the NFPS, sexual
victimization frequently occurred in the first facility to
which the inmates had been admitted. Among victims, nearly
half (49%) said they were victimized in the first prison they
had entered (table 12). Female victims (74%) were much more
likely than male victims (44%) to report having been
victimized in the first prison entered. This difference in
victimization may be partially explained by differences among
males and females in the likelihood of serving time in more
than one facility. An estimated 78% of males, compared to 57%
of females, had served time in two or more prison facilities
before their release; nearly 25% of males, compared to 7% of
females, had served time in four or more prison facilities
(not shown in table).

Among victims, sexual victimization by other inmates was more
likely than sexual victimization by staff to have occurred in
the first facility the inmates had entered. More than half
(57%) of the estimated 18,800 prisoners who reported sexual
victimization by another inmate indicated that it occurred in
the first prison facility they entered. Fewer than half (42%)
of the 23,800 victims of staff sexual misconduct indicated it
occurred in the first facility. 

Reports of sexual violence did not vary by size of facility,
facility age, crowding, inmate-to-staff ratios, or sex
composition of staff

Further analysis of prison placements provided a detailed
risk profile of facility-level characteristics in conjunction
with reported sexual victimization. Overall, few measurable
differences at the 95% level of statistical confidence
emerged among commonly cited facility risk factors (table
13). Sexual victimization rates (defined by type of
victimization and sex of inmate) did not increase with 

* increased size of the facility (based on the average daily
population during the 12 months prior to the census closest
in time to the inmate's placement)

* increased age of the facility (based on year of original
construction)
* facility overcrowding (based on the ratio of the number of
inmates the facility actually held to the official rated
capacity)

* increased inmate-to-staff ratios in the facility (based on
the number of inmates held to the total number of payroll,
non-payroll, and contract staff)

* decreased proportion of female to male staff.

Sexual victimization rates varied by type and primary
function of the facility and by indicators of facility
disorder

Among male former state prisoners, inmate-on-inmate and
staff-on-inmate victimization rates were higher in
facilities 

* under a court order or consent decree (to limit the number
of inmates, to address crowding, or in response to the
totality of conditions at the time of the census) than in
other facilities

* reporting a major disturbance (involving five or more
inmates and which resulted in serious injury or significant
property damage) in the 12 months prior to the census than in
other facilities

* with medium or greater security levels than in facilities
with minimum or low security levels 

* with a primary function of housing general population than
in facilities with specialized functions (e.g., reception or
diagnostic centers, community corrections centers, medical
treatment, and alcohol or drug treatment).

Among female former state prisoners, reports of
inmate-on-inmate victimization were lower in community
corrections centers (1.3%) and facilities that permitted 50%
or more of their inmates to leave unaccompanied during the
day (1.3%), than in facilities holding general population
(5.3%) or in general confinement facilities (5.0%).
Inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization rates were also lower
in minimum or low security facilities (3.0%) than in medium
security facilities (5.6%) and lower in privately operated
facilities (2.0%) than in state facilities (5.0%). 

Reports of staff sexual misconduct among female former state
prisoners did not vary significantly across facility
characteristics, except for being lower in minimum or low
security facilities (1.0%) than in medium security facilities
(3.0%) and higher in facilities under a court order (6.3%)
than in other facilities (2.0%). 

Whether a facility was publicly operated or privately
operated was an inconsistent predictor of victimization.
While reports by male former state prisoners of staff sexual
misconduct were higher in privately operated facilities
(4.6%) than in state facilities (2.5%), reports by female
former prisoners did not differ statistically between state
and privately operated facilities. Rates of inmate-on-inmate
victimization among women, but not among men, were lower in
privately operated facilities than in state facilities.

When an inmate had been placed in the facility was a strong
predictor of sexual victimization among male former
prisoners. As measured by the census year closest to the time
of placement, male former state inmates were nearly 4 times
more likely to report victimization by another inmate and 3
times more likely to report victimization by staff if they
had entered the facility around the 1990 census than if they
had entered around the 2005 census. Female inmates who
entered the prison facility around 1990 were nearly 8 times
more likely to report staff sexual misconduct (12.5%) than if
they had entered around 2005 (1.6%). However, rates of
inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization among females did not
differ by year of placement.

****************************************************
Prison placements and individual-level risk factors
****************************************************

While individual-level factors related to sexual
victimization have been examined by type of victimization and
sex of inmate for the entire period of incarceration, they
may also be examined for each prison placement. Such a
placement-based examination takes into account the risk of
victimization related to individual-level factors, regardless
of the duration of time served during a specific prison
placement, and permits analysis of the independent
contribution of individual-level and facility-level factors.
Unlike the earlier analysis based on individuals (510,800
former inmates nationwide), the placement analysis is based
on prison placements (more than 1.25 million prison
placements). Individuals are represented multiple times,
based on their number of separate prison placements (up to a
maximum of 15 times per inmate). 

An incident of sexual victimization was reported in 4.0% of
prison placements

Among the estimated 1.15 million placements of male inmates,
1.6% involved inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization and 2.6%
involved staff-on-inmate victimization (table 14). Among the
estimated 102,500 placements of female inmates, 4.8% involved
sexual victimization by another inmate and 2.4% involved
sexual victimization by staff. Overall, in 4.0% of the more
than 1.25 million prison placements, former prisoners
reported at least one experience of sexual victimization by
another inmate or facility staff.

These rates of victimization among all prison placements are
similar to those reported by inmates in NIS-2 based on the
current facility (during the last 12 months or since
admission, if shorter). Based on the NIS-2, 2.0% of currently
confined male inmates reported sexual victimization by
another inmate and 3.2% by staff; 5.1% of currently confined
female inmates reported sexual victimization by another
inmate and 2.3% by staff. 

Patterns of sexual victimization based on prison placements
also resembled those observed for individuals based on their
entire period of incarceration in NFPS, except that the rates
were somewhat lower across categories defined by demographic
and criminal justice characteristics:

* Large differences in sexual victimization during prison
placement were found among inmates based on their sexual
orientation (table 15).

* Among male former inmates, reports of inmate-on-inmate
sexual victimization during prison placement varied by race
and Hispanic origin. Reports were higher among white
non-Hispanic inmates (2.4%) and multi-racial inmates (4.0%)
than among black non-Hispanic inmates (0.9%). 

* Among male inmates, violent sex offenders reported higher
rates of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization (5.9%) than
other violent offenders (1.4%), property offenders (1.7%),
public-order offenders (1.0%), and drug offenders (0.8%).

* Among male former inmates, those with a prior incarceration
(1.4%) were less likely to be victims of other inmates than
those with no prior incarceration (2.5%).

* Among female former inmates, rates of inmate-on-inmate
victimization during prison placement did not significantly
vary across demographic characteristics, except among inmates
of two or more races.

* Among placements of male former prisoners, reports of staff
sexual misconduct were higher among black non-Hispanic inmates
(3.3%) than among white non-Hispanic inmates (2.0%) and
Hispanic inmates (1.7%). The rates were also higher among
younger male inmates (under age 25) than among older male
inmates (age 35 or older). 

* Among placements of female former prisoners, rates of staff
sexual misconduct were significantly lower among those ages 35
to 44 (1.5%) and age 45 or older (1.1%), compared to those
ages 20 to 24 (4.0%). 

* The only other statistically significant difference among
placements of female former inmates was that 8.1% of
multi-racial inmates reported staff sexual misconduct,
compared to 2.4% or lower among inmates who were white, black,
or Hispanic.

**************************************************
Independent contributions of individual-level and
facility-level factors to victimization
**************************************************

Variations in rates of sexual victimization among groups of
inmates based on the characteristics of facilities in which
they were placed overlap somewhat with variations based on
individual risk factors. Multivariate regression models were
developed to incorporate selected individual-level and
facility-level factors. Models for each type of sexual
victimization were developed separately for male and female
former prisoners based on prison placements 
(table 16). 

In each of the logistic regression models, the conditional
probabilities represent the probability that a former inmate
during a prison placement with a particular individual or
facility characteristic experienced sexual victimization,
conditional on the inmate having the mean value for all other
predictors in the model. For example, based on the final
multivariate model, a male former state prisoner who served
time for a violent sex offense had a 2.2% chance of having
been sexually victimized by another inmate during a prison
placement, given that he was at the mean of the joint
distribution of other individual characteristics (i.e., race
or Hispanic origin, marital status, sexual orientation, and
time served) and facility characteristics (i.e., type,
security level, census year closest to placement, and
placement order).

Variations in sexual victimization rates were strongly related
to sexual orientation after controlling for other factors

An inmate's sexual orientation remained an important correlate
of victimization, except for staff sexual misconduct reported
by females. Male inmates who identified themselves as bisexual
were at least 13 times more likely to report being sexually
victimized by another inmate and 4 times more likely to report
being sexually victimized by staff than male inmates who
identified themselves as straight or heterosexual. 

After controlling for other factors, an inmate's race or
Hispanic origin remained an important predicator of sexual
victimization.  Based on the multivariate placement models for
male former inmates 

* White non-Hispanic inmates (1.4%) and inmates of two or more
races (2.0%) had higher rates of inmate-on-inmate
victimization than black non-Hispanic and Hispanic inmates
(each 0.6%).

* Black non-Hispanic inmates (2.0%) had higher rates of
staff-on-inmate victimization than white non-Hispanic (1.4%)
and Hispanic inmates (1.2%).

Based on the multivariate placement models for female former
inmates 

* Inmate-on-inmate victimization rates were lower for black
non-Hispanic inmates (2.8%) than for white non-Hispanic
inmates (3.9%), Hispanic inmates (4.6%) and inmates of two or
more races (8.7%)

* Staff-on-inmate victimization rates were higher for inmates
of two or more races (6.1%) than for white non-Hispanic
(1.7%), black non-Hispanic (1.1%) and Hispanic inmates (1.1%).

Facitily-level factors remained significant after controlling
for inmate characteristics 

* Among male former inmates, inmate-on-inmate and
staff-on-inmate victimization rates were lower in reception or
diagnostic centers than in facilities that housed general
population. For inmate-on-inmate victimizations, rates were
lower in minimum security facilities than in facilities with
higher security levels. 

* Among female former inmates, the inmate-on-inmate
victimization rate was lower in facilities that permitted 50%
or more of their inmates to leave unaccompanied during the day
(than in other confinement facilities), lower in medium
security facilities (than in facilities with maximum, close,
or high security levels), higher in facilities that had been
built before 1951 or after 1985 (than in facilities built
between 1951 and 1985), and higher in facilities that had a
major disturbance in the census year (than in those that did
not).

* Among female former inmates, few facility-level factors were
linked to staff sexual misconduct. Rates were lower in minimum
or low security facilities than in medium security facilities,
and lower in facilities built between 1951 and 1985 than in
facilities built before 1951.

The final regression models confirm that the best predictor of
staff sexual misconduct among female former inmates was length
of time served, with the rate of staff sexual misconduct
during prison placements generally increasing with total time
served. 

***********************************
Reporting of sexual victimization
***********************************

In addition to identifying key individual-level and
facility-level risk factors associated with variations in
sexual victimization rates, the former inmate survey provided
data on the responses of victims and the impact on victims
while they were still in prison and after their release from
prison. The survey included questions about reporting
victimization to facility staff and persons other than
facility staff, reasons for not reporting and what happened if
they did report to facility staff, and the continued impact on
the victims following their release from prison.

Two-thirds of victims of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization
said they reported at least one incident to facility staff or
someone else

Detailed data suggest that victims of inmate-on-inmate
victimization were most likely to have reported at least one
incident to another inmate (49%), followed by having reported
to a family member or friend outside the facility (28%) and to
correctional officers (24%). Few victims (1.4%) had reported
their experience on a telephone hotline (table 17). 
An estimated 37% of victims of inmate-on-inmate sexual
victimization reported at least one incident to facility
staff 58% of those injured, compared to 29% of those not
injured (not shown in table). Reporting to medical and
healthcare staff was even less common (14% of the victims said
they reported an incident to medical personnel). Among those
physically injured by another inmate, a third (33%) said they
reported to medical staff (not shown in table).

22% of unwilling victims of sexual activity with staff,
compared to 3% of "willing" victims, said they had reported an
incident to facility staff or someone else

"Willing" sexual activity with staff was rarely reported to
any facility staff (2%) or to other persons (2%). When sexual
activity with staff was reported, it was typically unwilling
and divided nearly equally between reporting to staff (21%)
and someone other than staff (20%). 
                              
Most common reasons for not reporting sexual victimization by
other inmates linked to embarrassment, shame, and not wanting
others to know

Victims who never reported their experience of sexual
victimization to anyone at the facility were asked their
reasons for not reporting. The most common reason for victims
not reporting sexual victimization by another inmate was that
they "didn't want anyone else to know about it" (70%),
followed by feeling "embarrassed or ashamed that it happened"
(68%) (table 18). The most common reasons for not reporting
staff sexual misconduct were that they "had the sex or sexual
contact willingly" (80%) and they "didn't want the staff
person to get in trouble" (71%). Almost 40% of victims of
inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization and staff sexual
misconduct said they were afraid of being punished by staff.
Nearly a quarter of inmates victimized by another inmate or by
staff said they were afraid of being charged with making a
false report.

37% of victims who reported being victimized by other inmates
said facility staff did not respond

Among victims who reported inmate-on-inmate sexual
victimization to authorities 

* 34% were moved to administrative segregation or protective
housing, 24% were confined to their cell, 14% were assigned a
higher level of custody, and 11% were placed in a medical unit
or hospital.

*18% were offered a transfer to another facility.

* More than a quarter (29%) said they were written up; and 28%
said they spoke to an investigator (table 19).

Though few in number, 86% of the victims who reported staff
sexual misconduct to authorities said the facility responded:
more than half (54%) of the victims spoke to an investigator,
and nearly half (46%) said that they were "written up" for the
incident. More than 40% said they were moved to administrative
segregation or protective housing.

****************************************
Post-release responses to victimization
****************************************

Following their release from prison, victims of
inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization 

* had feelings of shame or humiliation (72%) and guilt (56%)
(table 20)

* discussed their victimization with intimate partners (27%)
or friends (26%)

* saw a therapist or counselor (15%), participated in a
self-help group for emotional or mental health problems (14%),
or enrolled in a treatment program other than counseling (8%).

Victims of staff sexual misconduct that involved unwilling
activity reported many similar feelings or thoughts about
their victimization following their release from prison:

* 79% said they felt shame or humiliation.

* 72% said they felt guilt.

* 54% reported having difficulty feeling close to friends or
family members.

Although the vast majority of victims (86%) of staff sexual
misconduct said they had at least one incident that they
considered "willing," more than a quarter (27%) said they felt
guilt and 23% said they felt shame or humiliation after their
release from prison.

************************
HIV testing and results
************************

The former inmate survey also provided self-report data on HIV
testing and outcomes for victims of inmate-on-inmate and
staff-on-inmate sexual victimization.

* Among former inmates tested for HIV, a significantly higher
percentage of those who had been sexually victimized by other
inmates (6.5%) or by staff (4.6%) were HIV-positive, compared
to those who had not been victimized (2.6%) (table 21).

* Among all victims tested for HIV, 5.1% of males and 3.9% of
females were HIV-positive (not shown in table).  

* Among all victims tested for HIV, 15.5% of non-heterosexual
inmates were HIV-positive, compared to 3.8% of heterosexual
victims (not shown in table). 

Although the rates of HIV infection are high among former
prisoners, when these inmates contracted HIV is unknown. 
Inmates were not asked if they became HIV-positive while
incarcerated. 

Through the National Prisoner Statistics program, BJS has
collected data on the number of inmates HIV-positive and the
number with confirmed acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS) since 1991. At yearend 2008, 20,499 inmates in state
prisons (or 1.6% of all inmates in custody) were known to be
HIV-positive or had confirmed AIDS. (See HIV in Prisons,
2007-08, NCJ 228307, BJS Web, December 2009.) Data are not
available on the percentage of inmates who were HIV-positive
when they were admitted to prison.

*****************************************
Current employment, housing, and living 
arrangements of former inmates
*****************************************

Following their release from prison, victims and nonvictims
did not differ in their employment and housing arrangements,
but victims were more likely than nonvictims to be living
alone 

The NFPS asked former prisoners about their current employment
status, housing, and living arrangements while on post-release
supervision. Except for a slightly higher percent of victims
living alone (18%) than nonvictims (14%), few differences were
reported in their current employment status or housing
arrangements:

* Two-thirds of both victims and nonvictims were employed; at
least half of each group were employed full-time.

* A quarter of victims and nonvictims were looking for work.

* More than 90% of victims and nonvictims were currently
living in a house, apartment, trailer or mobile home.

* An estimated 2% of victims and nonvictims said they were in
a shelter, homeless, or on the street (table 22).

************           
Methodology
************

The National Former Prisoner Survey (NFPS) was conducted
between January 2008 and October 2008. The data were collected
by the NORC at the University of Chicago under a cooperative
agreement with the Bureau of Justice Statistics. A total of
317 total parole offices in 40 states were included in the
survey sample. Within each of the sampled offices, respondents
were selected at random from rosters of eligible former
prisoners. A total of 17,738 former state prisoners under
active supervision participated in the survey. An additional
788 former prisoners were included from survey test offices.
These former inmates had been randomly selected from 16
sampled offices. Based on 18,526 completed interviews, the
survey achieved a 61% response rate.

The interviews, which averaged 23 minutes in length, were
conducted using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI)
and audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) data
collection methods. Survey interviewers initiated the personal
interview using CAPI to obtain demographic and criminal
history information. For the remainder of the interview,
respondents interacted with a computer-administered
questionnaire using a touch-screen and synchronized audio
instructions delivered via headphones. Respondents completed
the survey in private at the parole office (or satellite
office), with the interviewer in the room but unable to see
the computer screen.

The interviews were completed in 13 rounds of data collection.
The survey was typically scheduled for 2 weeks at each parole
office. Approximately 2 to 3 weeks before each round of
interviews, sampled respondents were contacted by mail. The
respondents were introduced to the survey, provided an
approximate data collection date, informed of the nature of
the survey, and given a toll-free number to set up an
appointment. Two weeks prior to the interview period, NORC
appointment setters called respondents to set up interview
appointments with those respondents who had not used the toll-
free number. 

Before the interview, respondents were informed verbally and
in writing that participation was voluntary and that all
information provided would be held in confidence. They were
also informed that if they agreed to participate, they would
receive $50 as a token of appreciation for participation in
the survey. A second automated consent protocol was
administered at the beginning of the ACASI portion of the
interview to confirm that the respondent had been properly
informed that participation in the survey was voluntary and
that they were "ready to continue with the interview."
Interviews were conducted in either English (99.4%) or Spanish
(0.6%). Twenty interviews (0.1%) were lost because the sample
parolee could not speak English or Spanish.

Sample design 

The NFPS used a multistage stratified sample design with
probabilities of selection proportionate-to-size (PPS). The
sampling frame was developed based on the 2006 Census of State
Parole Supervising Agencies, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau
on behalf of BJS. The original sampling frame consisted of two
subframes: a field office group (FOG) level frame of 800 field
office groups and a district level frame of 101 districts. Each
of these subframes was sampled separately to produce the sampled
offices. A two-stage stratified sample design was used for
selection from the office subframe, while a three-stage design
was used for the district subframe. 

Sampling from the field office subframe

Prior to selection of offices, the field office sampling frame
was modified:

* 40 offices were considered ineligible and deleted, including
administrative offices not actively supervising parolees;
specialty offices, such as those supervising sex offenders
only; and offices supervising only individuals committed to
treatment or other confinement facilities.

* 8 offices in the District of Columbia were deleted, as most
parolees had served time in federal facilities; 10 offices in
Alaska and 4 offices in Hawaii, except for the largest in each
state, were deleted.

* 34 offices, with a parolee population under 40 and that had
no other in-state office within 75 miles, were deleted.
  
* 27 offices included in the sample frame for the NFPS pretest
were excluded. (See page 36 for details on the inclusion of
pretest sample data in the final survey.)

* Offices with a parolee population under 40 were combined
with another office within 75 miles for sampling purposes to
form FOGs. 

Field offices and FOGs were selected from the remaining frame
of 800 offices using a PPS sampling procedure: 

* 34 FOGs were selected with certainty, due to their large
size, and allocated a sample size of 260 parolees.

* 117 FOGs were selected with non-certainty and allocated a
sample size of 130 for offices with populations of 130 or
greater, or the actual population sizes for offices with
populations of less than 130.

* 37 additional FOGs were selected as reserve offices and
activated in order of selection as needed to offset office
refusals and potential ineligible offices on the frame.

A total of 151 FOGs (including 7 involving combined offices)
were selected. Data collection was completed in 157 FOGs
(after exclusion of 4 ineligible administrative offices and
inclusion of 10 reserve sample offices.) All eligible sampled
offices agreed to participate.

Sampling from the district office sub-frame

The 2006 census provided data only at the district or regional
office in 19 states. A total of 50 districts were selected
from the list of 101 offices using PPS sampling procedures
(including 35 certainty and 15 non-certainty districts). An
additional 20 reserve districts were selected to offset
potential refusals and ineligible listings. Eleven of the
districts on the reserve list were activated. All sampled
state offices granted approval to participate in the survey;
however, one sampled district was excluded due to lateness of
the request.

Following selection of district offices, field offices and
population sizes within each selected district were
enumerated. The same grouping and elimination criteria as
listed above for parole offices were used for FOGs within each
district, except that the distance cutoff was increased to 120
miles. Offices with fewer than 40 parolees were only
eliminated if there was no other office with 120 miles for
grouping. Three offices were deleted due to the distance and
size criteria. Access to one office was denied by the district
and was replaced by another randomly selected office within
that district.

The remaining eligible FOGs within each sampled district were
selected using PPS sampling procedures. A total of 81 FOGs
were selected (including 21 with combined field offices). 

Parolee selection

After approvals from states and offices were received, a
roster was requested of eligible former prisoners under
active supervision by the parole office. Only persons who had
served time in a state prison and were age 18 or older were
eligible. Individuals who had absconded, were reincarcerated
or committed, were in a halfway house or community treatment
center, had a warrant issued for their arrest, were in
violator status, or had been transferred to another parole
office were ineligible.

Prior to sample selection, each roster was sorted by sex.
Males and females were then randomly selected for inclusion in
the survey. The target sample size was 260 (196 males and 64
females) in large field offices and 130 (98 males and 32
females) in smaller offices. Female former prisoners were
sampled at a higher rate than males to ensure that sufficient
numbers were included to provide reliable national estimates.
For offices with 130 or fewer eligible parolees, all former
prisoners were selected. In total, 34,782 former prisoners
were selected.

Response rates

Of the total number of former prisoners selected for the
national survey, 17,738 eligible and available respondents
completed the CAPI and ACASI portions of the interview: 

* 4,318 (12.4%) refused to participate in the survey for
reasons such as work, no transportation to the office,
unwillingness to discuss prison experiences, wanting to avoid
the parole office, dissatisfaction with the system, in
trouble, health issues, and other unknown reasons.

* 5,664 (16.3%) could not be reached due to absence of working
phone numbers, wrong phone numbers, failure to return phone
messages, or lack of interest communicated by the parole
officer or another person.

* 3,338 (9.6%) were found to be ineligible for reasons such as
death; deportation; under age 18; not on parole; under warrant
or absconder status; transferred to another office;
incarcerated at time of sample selection; or under warrant,
violator or absconder status after sample selection.

* 2,151 (6.2%) were unavailable due to change in status after
sample selection, primarily due to incarceration, transfer, or
completion of parole supervision. 

* 1,571 (4.5%) did not participate for other reasons,
primarily due to missing scheduled appointments.

Overall, 60.6% of eligible and available sampled former
prisoners participated in the survey.

Inclusion of pretest sample sites and respondents

Due to the extensive and burdensome nature of the pretest, and
the similarities in the pretest and national survey design and
content, data from the pretest were included in the final
survey results. PPS sampling methods were employed: 

* 16 offices from a list of 29 offices responsible for
supervision of post-release offenders were selected using PPS
sampling methods. 

* The initial protocol called for randomly sampling 75 cases
from each office, with a goal of obtaining 50 completed
interviews per office.

* A reserve sample of 50 former prisoners per office was drawn
for activation in case of high numbers of ineligible cases and
non-response.

* After interviewing in 8 offices, the initial sample sizes
were increased to 100 to address the large numbers of
ineligible cases on the office rosters.

* Sample sizes varied from 100 to 135 across 15 of the sampled
offices. One office, with a population of 67, had a sample
size equal to its population.

In total, 1,745 former prisoners were selected in the pretest.
Interviews were completed by 788 parolees (representing 64.5%
of the 1,222 eligible sampled cases).

Weighting and non-response adjustments

Responses from interviewed former prisoners were weighted to
provide national-level estimates. The construction of parolee
base weights took into account the probability of selection at
each stage, reflecting two stages in the field office subframe
and three stages in the district subframe: 

* Within the district sample, selection probabilities were
adjusted at the district and office levels for non-response.
 
* Within the field office sample, all selected FOGs
participated.

* Probabilities of selection from each subframe took into
account the impact of certainty and non-certainty districts
and offices. 

* Within selected FOGs in both subframes, males and females
were selected at different rates; consequently, the
probabilities of selection were computed separately.

* The final parolee base weights in the district sample
represent the inverse of the product of the non-response
adjusted probabilities from the district and FOG stages times
the probability of selection of male and female parolees
within field offices. The base weights in the field office
subframe represent the inverse of the product of the
probability of selection at the FOG and parolee stages.

A series of adjustments were applied to the initial base
weights to compensate for non-response among sampled parolees.
To produce final weights, the initial weights given to sampled
parolees who did not respond to the survey were distributed to
responding cases. A response propensity model was constructed
and used to form adjustment cells within which these weights
were reallocated:
 
* Variables used in the non-response adjustments were race,
age, years in prison, years since release, and required number
of office visits per month.

* Predicted probabilities obtained from the model were used to
construct five non-response groupings, based on the quintiles
of the probability distribution.

* Subsequent weight adjustment was done within each group, so
that the weights of nonresponding individuals within a range
of propensities were allocated to like individuals. 

Following procedures to address undesirably large weights,
final post-stratification was introduced to adjust the weights
to known control totals. All states in the sample frame were
divided into seven strata, and control totals for each stratum
were produced based on the midyear 2008 parolee counts.

The final weights in the national survey (including pretest
offices) averaged 27.57, resulting in a national estimate of
approximately 510,800.

Standard errors and confidence intervals

As with any survey estimates, the NFPS estimates are subject
to error arising from the fact that they are based on a sample
rather than a complete enumeration. A common way to express
this sampling error is to construct a 95%-confidence interval
around each survey estimate. Typically, multiplying the
standard error by 1.96 and then adding or subtracting the
result from the estimate produces the confidence interval.
This interval expresses the range of values that could result
among 95% of the different samples that could be drawn. 

To facilitate the analysis, rather than provide the detailed
estimates for every standard error, differences in the
estimates of sexual victimization for subgroups in these
tables have been tested and notated for significance at the
95%-level confidence. For example, the difference in the rate
of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization among female
prisoners (13.7%), compared to male prisoners (4.2%), is
statistically significant at the 95% level of confidence. (See
table 6 on page 15.) In all tables providing detailed
comparisons, statistically significant differences at the 95%
level of confidence or greater have been designated with two
asterisks (**).
 
Measurement of sexual victimization

The survey of sexual victimization relied on former inmates
reporting their direct experience, rather than reporting on
the experience of other inmates. Questions related to inmate-
on-inmate sexual activity were asked separately from questions
related to staff sexual misconduct.

The ACASI survey began with a series of questions that
screened for general unwanted sexual activities with other
inmates. To fully measure all sexual activities, a question
related to touching of specific body parts in a sexual way was
followed by a general question regarding any sexual activity
with another inmate in which the respondent did not want to
participate. (For specific screening questions, see appendix
A.) 

Respondents who answered "yes" to either of the sex-specific
screener questions were then asked questions related to the
touching of body parts in a sexual way and questions related
to acts of oral, anal, and vaginal sex. (For survey items
related to specific inmate-on-inmate victimization categories,
see appendix B.) The nature of coercion (including physical
force, pressure, and other forms of coercion) was measured for
each type of reported sexual activity.

ACASI survey items related to staff sexual misconduct were
asked somewhat differently. Respondents were first asked if
during their confinement staff had sexually harassed them,
watched them at an inappropriate time while dressing or taking
a shower, or forced them to undress or touched their private
parts in an inappropriate way. (See survey items in appendix
C.) 

Regardless of the responses to the initial questions, all
respondents were then asked two screener questions to
determine if they ever "willingly" or unwillingly had sex or
sexual contact with any facility staff. Respondents who
answered "yes" to either of the screener questions were then
asked questions related to "willing" and unwilling sex or
sexual contacts, the nature of coercion, and the specific
types of sexual contacts including oral, anal, and vaginal
sex. (For survey items related to specific staff-on-inmate
victimization categories, see appendix D.) 

Based on their responses to the survey items, victims were
classified in each of four general variables: (1) inmate-on-
inmate nonconsensual acts, (2) inmate-on-inmate abusive sexual
contacts only, (3) staff sexual misconduct unwilling; and (4)
staff sexual misconduct willing. 

The entire ACASI questionnaire (listed as the National Former
Prisoner Survey) is available on the BJS website at
http://www.bjs.gov.

Prison placements

In order to assess the impact of facility factors on the
likelihood of a former prisoner reporting inmate-on-inmate
sexual victimization and staff sexual misconduct, a separate
record for each prison placement was constructed. Overall, the
18,526 former prisoners in the survey reported entering
separate prison facilities 45,318 times during the period of
incarceration prior to their release from custody. Depending
on the number of state prisons entered, each respondent is
represented between 0 and 15 times. Facility-level data from
BJS prison censuses conducted in 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005
were merged to each placement record, based on the census
closest to the period of incarceration. 

Individual-level victimization variables and other individual-
level characteristics reported in the survey were included
with each placement. Of all 45,318 prison placements, 96% were
matched to an appropriate census data file. When weighted to
reflect initial probabilities of selection and non-response
adjustments, data were available for 1,254,998 of the prison
placements (approximately 94% of all placements). Local jail
placements (prior to prison, as an interim stop, or as the
only placement) were excluded. Placements in hospitals and
out-of-state facilities were also excluded.

Linkage of placements to prison census data

Prison facilities were identified from an initial list
provided by the 2000 Census of State and Federal Correctional
Facilities. Information on these facilities was enhanced by
the 1990 and 1995 censuses and contacts in departments of
correction in each state. The final list was programmed to
appear in the CAPI portion of the survey prior to the start of
ACASI. If the respondent provided a facility name that could
not be identified on the list after attempts to locate the
facility by name of city, the interviewer added the facility
to the list.

Initial rules were used to define the most appropriate census
file for linking the facility information. Each inmate
provided admission and release dates for the most recent
period of incarceration, not for individual facilities. The
following rules were applied to determine the reference year
for linkage, either the year of admission or the average year
(i.e., the midpoint between the admission and release date):

* If the victim was placed in only one facility, the average
year was used.

* If the victim was in multiple facilities, the admission year
was used for the first facility placement and the average year
for all other placements.

If the reference year was--
 
* 1992 or earlier, facility characteristics were drawn from
the 1990 census

* 1993-1997, facility characteristics were drawn from the 1995
census

* 1998-2002, facility characteristics were drawn from the 2000
census

* 2003 or later, facility characteristics were drawn from the
2005 census.

All unmatched facilities from the interviewer entry list were
identified and linked to an appropriate census file.

Logistic regression models

Multivariate logistic regression estimation is a modeling
technique used to determine what characteristics are
statistically significant for predicting a dichotomous outcome
(e.g., victimized or not victimized) while controlling for all
the other characteristics in the model. 

NFPS used this technique to determine what inmate-level
characteristics were significant predictors of inmate-on-
inmate sexual victimization and staff sexual misconduct over
the entire period of confinement. For each type of
victimization, and for males and females separately, selected
parolee characteristics were examined, including demographic
characteristics, sexual orientation and history, and criminal
justice status and history. For each type of victimization, a
logistic model was iteratively run under a backwards selection
technique until only predictors that were significant at the
95% level of confidence remained. (See table 10 on page 19.)

NFPS also used this technique to determine what facility-level
and inmate-level characteristics were significant predictors
of inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization and staff sexual
misconduct in each of the state prisons where the former
inmates had served time. Based on a separate record for each
prison placement for the 18,526 former prison inmates
interviewed, logistic regression models were developed to
model the effects of individual and prison-level
characteristics. For each type of victimization, a logistic
model was developed to isolate specific individual and
facility factors that remain significant at the 95% level of
confidence. (See table 16 on page 28.) 

Conditional marginal probabilities

In each of the logistic regression models, the conditional
marginal probability representsthe probability that an inmate
with a particular characteristic has experienced sexual
victimization (by type) conditional on the inmate having the
mean value for all other predictors in the model. For example,
based on a combination of individual characteristics only, a
white male former prisoner had a 4.0% chance of being
victimized by another inmate given that he was at the mean of
the joint distribution of age, sexual orientation, offense, and
total time served. 

For purposes of estimating the conditional marginal
probabilities, the overall log odds of incurring the event for
a given level of race/Hispanic origin was calculated from the
estimated linear model by specifying the value of the
race/Hispanic origin variable as the level of interest and
then specifying all other variables in the model to be the
weighted mean in the population. For example, the simple
logistic model for the binary variable Y (experienced sexual
victimization or not) is

where, i is the parameter of the race/Hispanic origin
category for the individual i ( i=1  n, n is the total number
of respondents). 

To calculate the log odds for a specific race/Hispanic origin
= r; use fixed r  and  x,

where,    .

For other categorical covariates x except race/Hispanic
origin, the mean value for each dummy variable is the weighted
percentage of the corresponding level. 

Based on the obtained log odds, the conditional marginal
probability was then calculated for the specific level of the
race/Hispanic = r as

These estimates (Mr) represent the expected risk of
victimization for a former inmate, conditional on the inmate
belonging to a particular group (defined by each
characteristic in the model) and having the mean value on all
of the other characteristics in the model. The conditional
marginal assumes that  x is constant, and the variance is due
to the variances of  . 

Significance tests

For each of the regression models, variances for the estimates
took into account the NFPS sample design. These variances were
computed with weighted data in SUDAAN using the Taylor
Linearization method.Wald F-statistics were calculated to test
for statistical significance of the effects of each
individual-level and facility-level characteristic (appendix
tables 3 and 4). The Wald F-statistics were used to test the
null hypothesis that all regression coefficients are equal to
zero for each characteristic (i.e., the probability of
experiencing victimization is the same across all categories
of the selected characteristic), conditional on all other
inmate or facility-level characteristics being included in the
model.

NFPS and NIS sample differences
 
Findings in the NFPS are limited to persons released from
state prison to a period of post-custody supervision
(including parole, probation following incarceration,
community supervised release, or other form of supervision).
Approximately 24% of all sentenced state prisoners released in
2008 were released unconditionally.  These former inmates,
some of whom may have experienced sexual victimization while
in prison, were not surveyed. Because these former inmates
were not subject to post-custody supervision, and correctional
authorities lacked their current addresses or phone numbers,
they could not be easily contacted and interviewed after their
release from prison. 

The NFPS findings should not be generalized to all former
prisoners. Based on selected demographic characteristics
reported in BJS's National Corrections Reporting Program in
2008, inmates released conditionally were similar to those
released unconditionally. Nearly the same percentage were male
(89.2% compared to 89.4%), under age 30 (34.9% compared to
35.2%), age 50 or older (10.1% compared to 10.2%), and
sentenced for a violent offense (25.4% compared to 26.6%).
However, inmates released unconditionally had served
significantly longer in prison than those released
conditionally. An estimated 23.2% of inmates released
unconditionally had served more than 3 years, compared to
15.9% of inmates released conditionally. In addition, 12.5% of
unconditional releases had served fewer than 6 months,
compared to 32.5% of conditional releases.

Caution is also recommended when comparing NFPS findings with
NIS-1 and NIS-2 findings, due to differences in coverage and
differences in composition among former and current inmates. 
In contrast with the NIS sample, the NFPS sample does not
include inmates who may never be released. (Based on data from
the 1997 Survey of Inmates in State Prison, approximately 5%
of all inmates in state prison were not expected to ever be
released.) In addition, the cross-section of former inmates is
comprised of less serious offenders with shorter maximum
sentences than the cross-section of inmates in the NIS sample.
For example, 33% of former inmates in NFPS had served time for
a violent offense, compared to 56% of state inmates in NIS-2
who were serving time for a violent offense.
