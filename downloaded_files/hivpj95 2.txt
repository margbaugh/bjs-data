Based on jurisdictions with more than 700 HIV-positive inmates.

*New York held more than a third of all inmates (9,500 inmates)
known to be HIV positive at yearend 1995. 

*Of all HIV-positive prison inmates, 21% were confirmed AIDS
cases.  

In State prisons, 21% of HIV-positive inmates had AIDS; in
Federal prisons, 16%.

*The overall rate of confirmed AIDS among the Nation's prison
population (0.51%) was more than 6 times the rate in the U.S.
population (0.08%).

Inmates in local jails, who have been tested for HIV, report
similar HIV-infection rates:

*Jail officials in the last national Census of Jails (conducted
in 1993) reported that 6,711 inmates were known to be HIV
positive and 1,888 had confirmed AIDS.  The infection rate was
highest in the largest jail jurisdictions.

At yearend 1995, 2.3% of all State and Federal prison inmates
were reported by prison authorities to be infected with the
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  In State prisons 23,404
inmates were HIV positive (2.4% of the total), and in Federal
prisons, 822 (0.9%).  Of all inmates in U.S. prisons, 5,099
prisoners (0.5%) had confirmed AIDS, and 18,165 prisoners were
HIV positive without having confirmed AIDS.

In 1995, 1,010 State inmates died of AIDS-related causes, up
from 955 in 1994.  For every 100,000 State inmates in 1995, 100
died of AIDS-related causes. Between 1991 and 1995 about 1 in 3
inmate deaths were attributable to AIDS-related causes.   

Based on personal interviews conducted from October 1995 through
March 1996 in the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, almost 6 in
10 jail inmates reported ever being tested for HIV.  Of those
tested, 2.2% reported being HIV positive.  Among female inmates,
2.4% said they were HIV positive; among  male inmates, 2.1%. An
estimated 1.6% of tested jail inmates who said they never used
drugs were HIV positive, as were 2.3% who ever used drugs, 3.0%
who used drugs in the month before arrest, 4.0% who used needles
to inject drugs, and 6.3% who shared needles.

Data sources
*************

Data on HIV/AIDS for prison inmates were provided by the
departments of corrections in 50 States and the District of
Columbia and by the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Since 1991
respondents have reported their HIV-testing policies and the
number of HIV-infected inmates in their custody at yearend. 
Those inmates are reported to be asymptomatic, symptomatic, or
with confirmed AIDS.   Respondents have also reported for each
year the number of inmate deaths from HIV-related infections as
well as other causes.

Data on HIV/AIDS and demographics for jail inmates were
calculated from the 1993 Census of Jails and the 1995-96 Survey
of Inmates in Local Jails.  Through personal interviews
conducted from October 1995 through March 1996, inmates held in
locally operated jails were questioned about current offenses,
prior drug use and treatment, personal characteristics, and
other aspects of their life.  Questions on whether inmates had
ever been tested for HIV and the results of the test were
included in the interviews.  

The 1993 Census of Jails provides the latest complete count of
HIV-positive jail inmates and AIDS-related deaths as well as an
overview of HIV testing policies in jail facilities.  When
combined with estimates from the 1995-96 survey of inmates, the
jail census provides the most up-to date information available
on HIV/AIDS in local jails.

Trends in HIV infection in U.S. prisons
****************************************

At yearend 1995, 24,226 inmates in State and Federal prisons
were known to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV). In 1993, 20,516 State prisoners were HIV positive; in 1995, 
23,404 were HIV positive, a 14% increase. The Federal Bureau of 
Prisons held 959 HIV-positive inmates in 1993 and 822 in 1995, 
a 14% decrease.

***************************************************************************

Between 1991 and 1995 the number of HIV-positive inmates grew at
about the same rate as the overall prison population (38%
compared to 36%). HIV-positive inmates comprised 2.3% of the
State prison population in 1991 and 2.4% in 1995. In Federal
prisons, HIV-positive inmates were 1.0% of all prisoners in 1991
and 0.9% in 1995.

HIV-infected inmates are concentrated in a small number of
States.  New York and Florida house the largest number of
HIV-positive inmates.  In 1995 these two States held a little
less than half of all HIV-positive inmates in the Nation.  New
York had the highest percentage of inmates known to be HIV
positive (13.9%), followed by Connecticut (5.1%), Rhode Island
(4.4%), Massachusetts (3.9%), and New Jersey (3.7%).

Eight States reported having 10 or fewer cases of HIV-positive
inmates in their prisons.  Vermont reported no HIV-positive
inmates. Twenty-seven States reported that fewer than 1.0% of
their inmate population were HIV positive. 

New York reported the largest growth in the number of
HIV-positive inmates, from 8,000 in 1993 to 9,500 in 1995. 
Substantial increases were also reported in Texas (an increase
of 678 inmates) and Florida (413).

Confirmed AIDS cases
in U.S. prisons
**********************

At the end of 1995, 5,099 confirmed AIDS cases were in U.S.
prisons--4,965 State inmates and 134 Federal inmates. 
Of the remaining HIV-positive inmates, 3,058 showed symptoms of
HIV infection and 15,107 were asymptomatic.

----------------------------------------

Note:  Care should be exercised when comparing the number of
reported cases over time.  In January 1993 the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention revised the HIV classification
system and expanded the surveillance case definition for AIDS to
include specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte criteria and three additional
clinical conditions--pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent
pneumonia, and invasive cervical cancer.  This expansion
resulted in a substantial increase in the number of reported
AIDS cases during 1993.  See Methodology.

*******************************************

The States with the largest number of confirmed AIDS cases were
New York (1,182), Florida (692), and Texas (495), which
accounted for 48% of all confirmed AIDS cases in State prisons. 
Eighteen States reported having fewer than 10 inmates with
confirmed AIDS in their prison systems.

Confirmed AIDS cases comprised a half of one percent of all
inmates in State and Federal prisons. Of those HIV-positive
inmates in prison,about a fifth were confirmed AIDS cases. 

As a percentage of the total prison population in each State,
the highest number of confirmed AIDS cases was in New York (1.7%
of inmates in the State), followed by Massachusetts, New Jersey,
and Rhode Island (each 1.5%).  In 16 States, confirmed AIDS
cases comprised 0.1% or less of State inmates.

******************************************
Comparison to the U.S. resident population 
******************************************

At the end of 1995, the rate of confirmed AIDS in State and
Federal prisons was more than 6 times higher than in the total
U.S. population.  Approximately 0.51% of all prisoners had
confirmed AIDS, compared to 0.8 of the population.

-----------------------------------------
Note:  The percent of the general population with confirmed AIDS
in each year may be overestimated due to delays in death
reports.  Care should be exercised when comparing percentages
over time, because of changes in the case definition for AIDS. 
See Methodology.
*******************************************

In every year after 1991 the rate of  confirmed AIDS was
significantly higher among prison inmates than 
in the general population.  In 1992 the rate of AIDS was nearly
10 times higher for prisoners than the general population.  In
1993, following a revision of the HIV classification system and
an expansion of the case definition for AIDS, the rate of
confirmed AIDS increased 1 1/2 times among prisoners and doubled in
the general population.  After the adoption of these new
measures, the incidence of AIDS grew  somewhat faster in the
general population (from 0.06% in 1993 to 0.08% in 1995) than in
prison (from 0.50% to 0.51%). At yearend 1995, the rate of
confirmed AIDS was over 6 times higher in prisons than in the
general population.

AIDS-related deaths in State prisons
**************************************

In 1995, 1,010 State inmates died of Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia, Kaposi's sarcoma, or other AIDS-related diseases.  
These AIDS-related deaths comprised about a third of
all deaths of State prisoners.

Note: In each year some States did not report complete data on cause of death.  
To calculate the rate of death, the number of inmates under State jurisdiction 
on June 30 of each year was used as an approximation of the average population 
exposed to the risk of death during the year.  Inmates in States that did not report 
data on inmate deaths were excluded in 1993 and 1994.  All States reported data 
on inmate deaths in 1995.
***********************************************************************************

The rate of death because of AIDS is about 3 times higher in the
prison population than in the total U.S. population age 15 to
54.  Between 1991 and 1995 about 1 in every 3 prisoner deaths
were attributable to AIDS-related causes, compared to about 1 in
10 deaths in the general population.  

From 1991 to 1995 "AIDS-related causes" was the second leading
cause of death for State prisoners behind "illness and natural
causes."  For every 100,000 State inmates in 1995, 109 died of
AIDS-related causes.  The number of AIDS-related
deaths in prison increased 94% from 1991 to 1995.

In 1995 AIDS-related causes accounted for over half of all
inmate deaths in New York (65%), Florida (59%), Connecticut
(57%), and South Carolina (54%).  Seventeen States reported
having no AIDS-related deaths, and 4 States reported only 1
AIDS-related death.

HIV infection of male and female 
State inmates
*********************************

At the end of 1995, there were 20,690 male and 2,182 female
State inmates infected with HIV--2.3% of all male and 4.0% of
all female State inmates.  The rate of HIV infection
was higher for women than men in every region and in most States.

In five States, all in the Northeast, more than 10% of female
inmates were known to be HIV positive--New York (22.7%), Rhode
Island (14.5%), Connecticut (13.4%), New Hampshire (11.4%), and
Massachusetts (10.5%).  New York (13.4%) was the only State in
which more than 10% of the male inmates were known to be
infected with HIV.

*********************
HIV-testing policies
*********************

Each State, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Bureau of
Prisons test their inmates for HIV based on certain criteria. 
Most jurisdictions (45 out of 52) test inmates if
they have HIV-related symptoms or if the inmates request a test.
Twenty-four States test inmates after they are involved in an
incident, and 15 States test inmates who belong to specific
"high-risk groups."

HIV infection of local jail inmates
*************************************

At midyear 1993, when the last national census of local jails
was conducted, 1.8% of the inmates were known to be HIV
positive.  Among jails reporting data, a total of 6,711 inmates
were HIV positive and 1,888 had confirmed AIDS.

*******************************************

The infection rate was highest in the largest jail
jurisdictions.  Almost 3% of the inmates in the Nation's largest
jurisdictions were reported to be HIV positive.  Among the
remaining jurisdictions, the larger the size, the greater the
percentage of inmates with HIV/ AIDS.  In jurisdictions with 500
or more inmates, 1.6% were infected; in jurisdictions with 250
to 499 inmates, 1.2% of the inmates; and in jurisdictions
holding fewer than 250 inmates, 1% or less of the inmates.

HIV test results for local jail inmates, 
by inmate characteristic
****************************************

More detailed data, based on interviews of a national sample of
inmates in local jails, are available from the 1995-96 Survey of
Inmates in Local Jails. Conducted between October 1995 and
March 1996, the survey provides national estimates of the numbers 
of jail inmates tested for HIV/AIDS and the percent HIV positive.

An estimated 62% of all respondents in the survey said they had
ever been tested for HIV. Of those who had been
tested and reported HIV test results (289,991), 2.2% said they
were HIV positive. Among men, 2.1% said they were HIV positive;
among  women, 2.4%.  An estimated 2.6% of black non-Hispanic
inmates, compared to 1.4% of white non-Hispanic inmates, said
they tested HIV positive.

***********************************************************************

Among male inmates, black non-Hispanics (66%) were more likely
to have been tested for HIV than white non-Hispanics (62%) and
Hispanics (54%).  Among those tested, black male inmates (2.5%)
were nearly twice as likely as white male inmates (1.3%) to
report being HIV positive.

Among female inmates, black non-Hispanics (75%) were also more
likely to have ever been tested for HIV than white non-Hispanics
(66%).  Although the percent who said they were HIV positive was
higher among black females than white or Hispanic female
inmates, the differences were not statistically significant. 
(See Methodology  for sample design and accuracy of the survey
methods.)

Inmates in the age groups 25 to 34 and 35 to 44 were more likely
to report having been tested for HIV than inmates in other age
groups.  Inmates age 24 or younger had the lowest rates of HIV
positive (0.7%), while those 35 to 44 had the highest rates
(3.8%).

Inmates with a GED (69%) and those who completed high school
(67%) were more likely to have ever been tested for HIV than
inmates who had not completed high school (58%).  Inmates who
had completed high school were as likely as those who had not
completed high school to say they tested HIV positive (2.3%).

Percent HIV positive among jail inmates, 
by offense and prior drug use
****************************************

Among jail inmates who said they had been tested for HIV/AIDS,
those held for drug offenses were the most likely to be HIV
positive (3.3%).  Drug offenders were twice as likely as violent
offenders (1.5%) to report that they tested positive for HIV. 
property and public-order offenders reported somewhat lower
rates--2.2% and 1.7%, respectively.

The percentage of jail inmates reporting that they were HIV
positive varied by level of prior drug use.  An estimated 2.3%
of inmates who had ever used drugs, 3.0% of convicted inmates
who used drugs in the month before their current  offense, 4.0%
of  inmates who said they had used needles to inject drugs, and
6.3% of those who had shared a needle with someone else were HIV
positive.

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics
------------------------------

The National Prisoner Statistics series (NPS-1) includes an
annual yearend count of prisoners by jurisdiction, sex, race,
Hispanic origin, and admissions and releases during the year. 
The series consists of yearly reports to BJS from the
departments of corrections of the 50 States and the District of 
Columbia and from the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 

Since 1991 respondents have been asked to indicate their
policies for testing for HIV and to provide the number of
HIV-infected inmates in their custody on the last day of the
calendar year.  

AIDS in the U.S. resident population
-------------------------------------

The number of persons with confirmed AIDS in the U.S. general
population (age 13 and over) was derived from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HIV/AIDS Surveillance
Report, yearend editions 1991-95.  For each year the number of
active AIDS cases in the United States was calculated by
subtracting the number of cumulative AIDS deaths for people age
15 or older at yearend from the cumulative number of total AIDS
cases for people age 13 or older at yearend as listed in the
HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report.

The data for the U.S. general population, excluding persons
under age 13, for 1991 to 1995 were taken from U.S. Population
Estimates, by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin: 1990 to 1995.
Population Projections Branch, Population Division:  U.S. Bureau
of the Census, February 14, 1996, PPL-41.

The rate of confirmed AIDS cases in the U.S. resident population
was calculated by dividing the annual totals for individuals
with AIDS by the population estimates for the U.S. resident
population of individuals age 13 or older.

The classification system for HIV infection and the case
definition for AIDS were expanded in 1993.  This expansion
improved estimates of the number and characteristics of persons
with HIV disease, but complicated interpretation of AIDS trends.

The increase in reported AIDS cases in 1993 was largely the
consequence of the added surveillance criteria.  (See CDC,
Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Vol. 43, No. 45, November
18, 1994.)

AIDS-related deaths in the United States
------------------------------------------

The number of AIDS-related deaths for persons age 15-54 was
derived from the CDC, HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, yearend
editions 1994 and 1995.  Deaths in the U.S. population for
persons age 15-54 were taken from the CDC, Monthly Vital
Statistics Report, Vol. 42, No. 2(S); Vol. 43, No. 12; Vol. 43,
No. 6(S); and Vol. 45, No. 3(S).  

AIDS-related deaths as a percentage of all deaths in the U.S.
population were calculated by dividing the national estimate of
AIDS deaths of persons age 15-54 by the national mortality
estimates of persons age 15-54 in a given year.

Data on jail inmates
----------------------

A jail is defined as a confinement facility administered by a
local government agency that holds persons detained pending
adjudication and persons committed after adjudication, usually
for sentences of a year or less.  Convicted jail inmates are
either awaiting sentencing, serving sentences to jail
confinement, awaiting transfer to a prison, or serving a prison
sentence in jail by arrangement with prison authorities. 
Unconvicted inmates are those who have been unable to obtain
pretrial release, those detained pending trial, those on trial
at the time the survey was being conducted, and those held for
other governmental entities.   

Census of Jails
----------------

The 1993 Census of Jails included all locally administered
confinement facilities (3,287) that held inmates beyond
arraignment and were staffed by municipal or county employees. 
The census also included 17 jails that were privately operated
under contract for local governments.  

Excluded from the census were temporary holding facilities, such
as drunk tanks and police lockups, that do not hold persons
after being formally charged in court (usually within 72 hours
of arrest).  Also excluded were State-operated facilities in
Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and
Vermont, which have combined jail-prison systems.

Survey of Inmates in Local Jails
---------------------------------

The 1995-96 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails was conducted for
BJS by the U.S. Bureau of the Census.  Through personal
interviews conducted from October 1995 through March 1996, data
were collected on individual char-acteristics of jail inmates,
current of-fenses, sentences and time served, criminal
histories, jail activities, conditions and programs, prior drug
and alcohol use and treatment, and health care services provided
while in jail.  Similar surveys of jail inmates were conducted
in 1972, 1978, 1983, and 1989.

Sample design
---------------

The sample for the 1995-96 survey was selected from a universe
of 3,328 jails that were enumerated in the 1993 Census of Jails.

The sample design was a stratified two-stage selection.  In the
first stage six separate strata were formed based on the size of
the male and female populations.  In two strata all jails were
selected--those jails housing only females, and those with
either more than 1,000 males or more than 50 females or both. 
In the remaining four strata a systematic sample of jails was
selected. Each jail within a stratum had an equal probability
of selection. Equal probabilities were used instead of
probability proportional to size because jail populations were
likely to change between 1993 and 1995.  Overall, 462 jails were
selected.  Interviews were conducted in 431 jails; 19 refused, 8
were closed, and 4 were on the universe list in error.

In the second sampling stage, interviewers visited each selected
facility and systematically selected a sample of male and female
inmates using predetermined procedures.  As a result,approximately 
1 in every 100 males were selected in 4 strata and 1 in 83 in the 
other male stratum.  Depending on the stratum, 1 in 50, 25, 24, or 
21 females were selected.  A total of 6,133 inmates were interviewed, 
and 738 refused to participate, for a second stage nonresponse of 10.8%.
The total nonresponse from
both stages was 13.7%.

Based on the completed interviews, estimates for the entire
population were developed using weighting factors derived from
the original probability of selection in the sample.  These
factors were adjusted for variable rates of nonresponse across
strata and inmate characteristics.  Further adjustments were
made to control the survey estimates to counts of jail inmates
obtained from the 1993 Census of Jails and the 1995 Annual
Survey of Jails.

Accuracy of the survey estimates
-----------------------------------

The accuracy of the estimates from the 1995-96 Survey of Inmates
in Local Jails depends on two types of error:  sampling and
nonsampling.  Sampling error is variation that may occur by
chance because a sample rather than a complete enumeration of
the population was conducted.  Nonsampling error can be
attributed to many sources, such as nonresponse, differences in
the interpretation of questions among inmates, recall
difficulties, and processing errors.  In any survey the full
extent of the nonsampling error is never known.

The sampling error, as measured by an estimated standard error,
varies by the size of the estimate and the size of the base
population.  Estimates for the percentage of inmates ever tested
for HIV and the percentage who tested HIV positive have been
calculated (see appendix table).  These standard errors may be
used to construct confidence intervals around percentages.  For
example, the 95-percent confidence interval around the
percentage of males who were HIV positive is approximately 2.1%
plus or minus 1.96 times 0.33% (or 1.5% to 2.7%).

These standard errors may also be used to test the statistical
significance of the difference between two sample estimates by
pooling the standard errors of the estimates (that is, by taking
the square root of the sum of the squared standard errors for
each sample estimate).  All comparisons discussed in this report
were statistically significant at the 95-percent confidence
level.

Other reports on HIV/AIDS 
----------------------------

HIV/AIDS-related data are collected through regularly scheduled
BJS censuses and surveys of correctional agencies and offenders
under correctional supervision.  Annual publications provide
only the most recently obtained information.  See previous BJS
reports for HIV/AIDS data in local jails and HIV test results
reported by State prisoners  (HIV in U.S. Prisons and Jails,
NCJ-143292; HIV in Prisons and Jails, 1993, NCJ-152765; and HIV
in Prisons 1994, NCJ-158020). 

The data published from the BJS collections complement those
collected in surveys sponsored by the National Institute of
Justice (NIJ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC).  The most recent report by Theodore M. Hammett and
others, 1994 Update: HIV/AIDS and STDs in Correctional
Facilities (December 1995, NCJ-156832), contains detailed
reporting about the prevalence, testing, education, and
prevention for HIV and AIDS in Federal, State, and 29 large
city/county correctional systems.  The 1994 update provides
cumulative total inmate deaths by region, total current AIDS
cases, and HIV-seroprevalence data by both jurisdiction and type
of testing policy.  

Currently, the NIJ and CDC are working on the ninth national
survey of HIV/AIDS in Correctional Facilities.  The survey
sample will include the Federal Bureau of Prisons, all 50 State
departments of corrections plus Puerto Rico, all 50
State-operated juvenile commitment facilities, 50 of the largest
jail systems, 30 of the largest region- or county-based juvenile
detention centers, 50 State health departments, and other public
health agencies in the United States as identified by CDC.  In
addition, 50 adult correctional facilities and 50 juvenile
facilities within the surveyed Federal, State, and regional/
county jail systems will be included in the survey sample to
validate system responses related to policy issues.

The NIJ-CDC study will also collect information  on the impact
of infectious disease on correctional policy-related questions
and related legal issues, prevalence of HIV/AIDS and TB,
confirmed AIDS case rates, and AIDS-related deaths among
correctional populations.
