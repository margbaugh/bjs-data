Highlights
***********

* National Crime Victimization Survey violent crime 
rates declined 7%, and property crime rates fell 12% 
from 1997 to 1998.  The 1998 rates are the lowest
recorded since the survey's inception in 1973. 
(Note:  After adjusting rates following the 1992 
NCVS redesign.)

* Based on preliminary FBI data, the number of murders
dropped about 8% between 1997 and 1998.

* The overall 1-year decline in violent crime resulted 
from a slight yet significant decline in aggravated 
assault rates.  From 1997 to 1998 no significant changes 
in rates of rape or sexual assault, robbery, or simple 
assault occurred.  

* Every major type of crime measured -- rape or sexual 
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, simple assault, 
burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft -- decreased 
significantly between 1993 and 1998. 

* For virtually every demographic category considered, 
violent victimization decreased between 1993 and 1998.  
Male violent victimization rates fell 39%, and black 
violent victimization rates fell 38%. 

* Property crime rate declines occurred across all 
demographic groups between 1993 and 1998.  Overall 
property crime rates declined at least 31% for white, 
black, urban, and suburban households. 

* In 1998 males were victimized at significantly 
higher rates than females, and blacks were victimized 
at somewhat higher rates than whites.  Non-Hispanics 
and Hispanics were victimized at about the same rate. 

* About half the violent crime victims knew the 
offender(s) in 1998.  Over 7 in 10 rape or sexual 
assault victims knew the attacker(s), and 5 in 10 
aggravated assault victims knew the offender(s).

* Offenders used a weapon in about a fourth of 
violent victimizations in 1998.  About 4 in 10
robbery victims faced a weapon, as did fewer than
1 in 10 rape or sexual assault victims.

* From 1993 to 1998, almost half of all violent 
victimizations were reported to the police.  
Females and blacks reported violent victimizations 
in higher percentages than males and whites, while 
no reporting differences emerged between non-Hispanics 
and Hispanics during the same period.

**************************************************

Americans age 12 or older experienced approximately 
31 million violent and property victimizations according 
to National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data.  
Overall criminal victimizations included about 22.9 
million property crimes (burglary, motor vehicle theft, 
and household theft), 8.1 million violent crimes (rape 
or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault,
and simple assault), and about 0.3 million personal 
thefts (pocket picking and purse snatching).  
          
The 31 million criminal victimizations in 1998 represent 
a decline from 35 million victimizations in 1997 and 
continue a downward trend that began in 1994.  Criminal 
victimization estimates from 1998 are the lowest recorded 
since 1973, when approximately 44 million victimizations 
occurred.  

Between 1993 and 1998 violent crime rates fell 27%, 
from 50 to 37 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older. 
The 1998 personal theft rate was equal to the 1997 
rate but lower than the 1993 theft rate.  

Property crime decreased 12% from 1997 to 1998 and 
32% from 1993 to 1998.  The 1998 rate of 217 property 
crimes per 1,000 households is lower than both the 
1997 and 1993 levels.  

Every major NCVS violent and property crime rate fell 
from 1993 to 1998.  Almost every demographic group had 
lower rates of violent and property victimization during 
the same period.

Violent crime
*************

The NCVS collects data on nonfatal violent crimes against 
persons age 12 or older, both reported and not report-
ed to the police.  The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) 
Program of the FBI collects data on murder and nonnegligent 
manslaughter.

**********************************          
Violent crime measured by the NCVS
**********************************

Overall violent victimization includes rape, sexual 
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault 
(table 1).  The 7% decrease in violent crime between 1997 
and 1998 from 39 to 37 victimizations per 1,000 persons 
was marginally significant.  While 1998 completed violence 
rates did not change from 1997 values, attempted or 
threatened violent crime fell somewhat (27 to 25 
victimizations per 1,000 persons).

Overall rates of assault, aggravated assault, and 
aggravated assaults involving threats with a weapon 
decreased somewhat from 1997 to 1998.  Overall robbery 
rates remained unchanged, although completed robberies 
with injury declined slightly.  

Rape or sexual assault, simple assault, and personal 
theft rates remained unchanged from 1997 levels.             

Several demographic groups were less vulnerable to 
violent victimization in 1998 than the year before.  
For blacks the violent victimization rate fell from 
49 to 42 victimizations per 1,000 blacks, while rates 
for Hispanics fell from 43 to 33 victimizations per 1,000 
Hispanics.

Urban violent victimization decreased marginally between 
1997 and 1998. Declines in violent victimization of blacks 
resulted from decreases in simple assault (28 to 22 simple 
assaults per 1,000 blacks).  Hispanic rate declines
came from decreases in aggravated assault (10 versus 
6 aggravated assaults per 1,000 Hispanics).  Because of 
small sample sizes, determining specific sources of 
declines for other demographic groups was not possible.

Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter 
measured by the FBI
**********************************

Preliminary estimates from the Uniform Crime Reporting 
(UCR) program of the FBI suggest that the murder rate 
declined about 9% between 1997 and 1998. The number of 
murders in the United States decreased 8%. Similar 
declines occurred across all population categories of 
cities and all regions in the Nation, according to the 
preliminary data.

**************
Property crime
**************

The NCVS defines property crime as a composite of burglary, 
motor vehicle theft, and theft.  Overall property crime 
rates fell 12% from 248 to 217 incidents per 1,000 households 
between 1997 and 1998. 

Burglary rates fell 14%, from 45 to 39 victimizations per 
1,000 households, between 1997 and 1998.  Rates for all 
categories of burglary except attempted forced entry 
decreased from 1997.  

Motor vehicle theft rates fell 22% from 1997 to 1998 
because of a 20% decline in completed motor vehicle 
theft (from 10 down to 8 completed motor vehicle thefts 
per 1,000 households), and a decrease of 27% in attempted 
motor vehicle theft (from 4 to 3 attempted motor vehicle 
thefts per 1,000 households).  

Household theft rates decreased 12% from 1997 to 1998 
(from 190 to 168 thefts per 1,000 households) because 
of decreases in completed thefts (down 11%), theft of items 
valued at less than $50 (down 16%), theft of items valued 
between $50 and $249 (down 10%), and a slight decline in 
thefts of items valued at $250 or more (down 8%).  Attempted 
household theft rates declined 21% from 1997 to 1998. 

Except for the categories described below, households of 
all races, ethnicities, incomes, regions, and statuses of 
home ownership experienced declines in overall property 
crime rates from 1997 to 1998.  Overall property crime rates 
fell slightly for rural households.  Households headed by an 
Asian or American Indian ("other races"), households with an 
annual income between $7,499 and $15,000, and households in 
the Midwest had no change in the property crime rate from 
1997 to 1998.
  
The overall property crime rate for white households 
fell because of decreases in every type of property crime 
measured: burglary, motor vehicle theft, and household theft.  
The overall property crime rate for black households declined 
because of a decrease in household theft only.

Non-Hispanic households had a rate decline in all categories 
of property crime.  Declining property crime rates for 
Hispanic households resulted from decreasing burglary and 
household theft rates and a slight decrease in the rate of 
motor vehicle theft.

Characteristics of violent crime 
victims, 1998
************************************

Victimization research consistently has found that victimization 
rates are related to individual demographic characteristics 
(table 2).  Analyses demonstrate that demographic groups which 
were historically susceptible to victimization continue to be 
the most susceptible to victimization in 1998.

***********************End of table 2**************************


****************
Gender of victim
****************

For overall violent crime and simple assault, the rates for 
males were 30% greater than those for females in 1998.  Males 
were twice as likely as females to be victims of aggravated 
assault (11 versus 5 victimizations per 1,000 persons), while 
females sustained rape or sexual assault at a rate 14 times 
that of males (2.7 versus 0.2 victimizations per 1,000 persons).
Males had slightly greater robbery victimization rates than 
females in 1998 (5 incidents versus 4 incidents per 1,000 persons).  

**************
Race of victim
**************

Blacks had marginally higher overall violent crime rates than 
whites and significantly higher rates than persons of other races 
in 1998.  Whites and persons of other races differed in the rates 
of violent victimization overall, robbery, and simple assault in 1998.  
Blacks and whites did not differ significantly in the rates of 
victimization by robbery, simple assault, and rape or sexual 
assault.

*******************
Ethnicity of victim
*******************

Non-Hispanics and Hispanics experienced similar rates of 
overall violent crime in 1998.  Non-Hispanics had higher 
rape or sexual assault rates and somewhat higher simple 
assault rates than Hispanics.  Robbery rates were higher 
for Hispanics than for non-Hispanics (6 versus 4 
incidents per 1,000 persons).  No difference in aggravated 
assault or personal theft rates was found between the groups.  

*************
Age of victim
*************

In general, the younger the person, the greater the overall 
violent victimization rate in 1998.  Persons age 16-19 
sustained violent victimizations at higher rates than 
persons in other age categories.  Persons age 12-15 were 
raped or sexually assaulted at 4 times the rate of persons 
50 or older; those age 16-24, at a rate 5 times that of 
persons age 50 or older.  

****************
Household income
****************

Violent crime rates increased as household income decreased 
in 1998 (table 3).  Persons in households with annual 
incomes greater than $35,000 had lower violent crime 
rates than persons in households at any other income 
level, while persons in households with incomes of less 
than $7,500 experienced a higher violent crime rate than 
other households.

***********************End of table 3**************************

**************
Marital status
**************

In 1998 those who had never married were the most likely 
to be violent crime victims.  Those who were divorced or 
separated were more likely to be victimized than married 
individuals. In turn, married individuals had higher 
victimization rates than widowed persons.  Those who had 
never married became violent crime victims at 10 times 
the rate of widowed persons and at over 3 times the rate 
of married persons.  

**************
Region
**************

Western residents had higher violent victimization rates 
than people in other regions in 1998 (47 victimizations 
per 1,000 persons).  Violent victimization rates were 
marginally higher for Midwesterners (40 per 1,000) than 
for Southern and Northeastern residents (31 per 1,000 
for each region).  

**************
Urbanization
**************

Urban residents were victimized by violent crime overall 
at a higher rate than suburban residents, and suburban 
residents experienced violent victimization at a higher 
rate than rural residents in 1998.  This pattern also 
emerged for the rates of aggravated assault and personal 
theft.  Rates of robbery among suburban and rural residents 
did not differ significantly but were lower than those for 
urban residents.  The urban rate of simple assault was 
slightly higher than the suburban rate, which was 
significantly higher than the rural rate.  No 
significant difference between urban, suburban, and 
rural rates for rape or sexual assault occurred in 1998.  

****************************
Victim-offender relationship
****************************

Over half of violent crime victims knew the offender(s)
in 1998 (table 4).  Rape or sexual assault victims were
most likely to know the offender(s) (74%), and robbery
victims least likely to know the offender(s) (41%).
Victims identified intimates (current or former 
spouses, boyfriends, and girlfriends) as offenders 
in 12% of overall violent crimes, robbery, and simple 
assault.  Ten percent of aggravated assault victims and 
18% of rape or sexual assault victims were victimized by 
an intimate.

a/Based on 10 or fewer sample cases. 

***********************End of table 5********************

When an offender had a weapon, it was most likely to be a 
firearm or an object used as a weapon such as a rock, club, 
or a blackjack.  Over a third of all armed assaults were 
committed by an offender using an object as a weapon, and 
slightly less than a third by an offender with a firearm.  
Offenders with a firearm committed 21% of all serious 
victimizations (rape, sexual assault, robbery, and 
aggravated assault).  About half of armed robberies 
(53%) and armed rape or sexual assaults (44%) were 
committed by an offender using a firearm.

Race of household head
********************** 

Black households were property crime victims at a 
higher rate than white households (248 versus 213 
crimes per 1,000 households, see table 6).  Households 
with an Asian or American Indian head (collectively 
called "other race") experienced 225 property crimes 
per 1,000 households, not significantly different from 
black or white households.

***********************End of table 6******************

Households headed by blacks sustained burglaries and 
motor vehicle thefts at higher rates than households 
headed by whites and persons of other races.  Theft 
rates were comparable among households headed by whites, 
blacks, and persons of other races in 1998.  

***************************
Ethnicity of household head
***************************

Hispanic households were characterized by significantly 
greater overall rates of property crime, motor vehicle 
theft, and theft, and marginally greater rates of burglary 
than non-Hispanic households in 1998.  Hispanic headed 
households were more than twice as likely to be victims 
of motor vehicle theft than non-Hispanic headed households 
(22 versus 10 motor vehicle thefts per 1,000 households). 

************************************
Region, urbanization, and home ownership
************************************

Western households had the highest rate of overall 
property crime, motor vehicle theft, and theft rates 
of all regions in 1998.  Western, Southern and Mid-
western households experienced similar burglary rates, 
and North-eastern households had the lowest burglary 
rate in the Nation. Urban households were the most 
vulnerable to overall property crime and burglary in 
1998.  Suburban households were least likely to experience 
motor vehicle theft.  Households in rented housing were 
more vulnerable to overall property crime, burglary, motor 
vehicle theft, and household theft than those that owned 
their home. 

****************
Household income
****************
     
In general, the higher the annual household income, 
the higher the theft rate in 1998.  Households with 
annual incomes greater than $50,000 experienced about 
30% more household thefts than those with incomes less 
than $15,000.  Household income was unrelated to motor 
vehicle theft rates in 1998.  

Burglary rates increased as annual household income 
decreased.  Households with incomes of less 
than $15,000 annually had twice the burglary rate 
of households with annual incomes of greater than $35,000. 

***********************    
Reporting to the police
***********************

Victims reported about half of all violent crimes 
(46%) and about a third (35%) of property crimes to 
the police in 1998.  Among violent crimes, victims 
reported robberies most often (62%) and rape or 
sexual assaults least often (32%).  Victims notified 
authorities in approximately a third of personal 
theft victimizations.  Among property crimes, motor 
vehicle thefts continued to be the property crime most 
often reported (80%).

Female victims reported a higher percentage of violent 
crime to the police than did male victims in 1998 (51% 
versus 42%).  Black victims reported violent victimizations 
in higher percentages than white victims (52% versus 44%).  
Violent victimization reporting to police was equal for 
Hispanic and non-Hispanic victims, as well as for urban, 
suburban, and rural victims.  Southern victims reported 
violent victimizations to the police in somewhat higher 
percentages than Northeastern victims and in higher 
percentages than victims in the West.

males in 1998 (37% versus 33%).  Non-Hispanic households 
reported property crimes to police at a higher rate than 
did Hispanics (36% versus 32%).  Black and white households, 
and urban, suburban, and rural households reported property 
crimes to police in similar percentages (not all shown in 
a table).  Southern households reported property victimization
to the police in somewhat higher percentages than Northeastern
households and in higher percentages than Western households.

Trends in violent victimization
*******************************

Because the National Crime Victimization Survey relies on 
a sample of households, the rates and numbers from it are
estimates and are not exact.

The figure shows trends in the violent victimization rate:
Each bar shows the range within which the true victimization
rate is likely to fall for the indicated year, and the line
represents the best estimate, the most likely value for the
rate in each year, which is the published number. There is a
greater likelihood that the true rate will fall near the best
estimate, and the bars reflect that likelihood:  The darker the
bar segment, the greater the likelihood.

Because the estimates are based on samples, their precision
depends on the sample size:  The larger the sample, the better
the estimate and the smaller the range bars.  Some year-to-year
changes are so large that contiguous bars do not touch (1980-81,
1982-83, 1990-91, 1994-95, and 1995-96), suggesting statistically
significant increases and decreases.  Where there is a lot of
overlap(1973-76 and 1986-90), the year-to-year changes may be too
small to be statistically significant. 
            
Even though the victimization rates have a range of possible values,
general trends are readily apparent. Violent crime rates increased
from the early 1970's to the early 1980's, then fell until around 1986.
For several years in the late 1980's, violent crime rates were stable,
but increased in the early 1990's and fell after 1994 through 1998.

Victimization Survey, NCJ 167881.

Murder and nonnegligent 
manslaughter
****************************

According to preliminary UCR data, the rate and 
overall number of murders in the United States in 
1998 appear to be continuing the steady decline 
that began in 1993.  

************************* Box on murder ***************

************************************
Murder in the United States, 1998
************************************

Statistics on murder are compiled from over 16,000 
city, county, and State law enforcement agencies 
as part of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports.  In 1997 
the UCR program stated that 18,210 murders occurred 
in the United States.  Preliminary 1998 UCR data 
suggest about an 8% drop in the number of murders and 
a 9% drop in the murder rate from 1997.  

The FBI defines murder in its annual Crime in the 
United States as the willful (nonnegligent) killing 
of one human being by another.  The incidence of murder 
varies across victim characteristics.  While the number 
of homicides has decreased since 1993, the pattern of 
characteristics of homicide victims has remained 
relatively unchanged year after year.

*  In general, three-fourths of murder victims are male.

*  Whites and blacks each make up about half of 
murder victims.

*  Approximately 1 in 8 murder victims are under age 18

*  Firearms are used in about 70% of murders.

*  The homicide rate tends to be highest in the South and 
lowest in the Northeast.

*  The homicide rate tends to be higher in metropolitan 
cities than in smaller cities and rural areas.

Violent crime
*************

Between 1993 and 1998 the overall violent crime rate 
fell 27% from 52 to 38 incidents per 1,000 persons.  
Over the same period the rate of robbery declined 33%; 
aggravated assault 38%; simple assault 20%; and rape or 
sexual assault rates 40%. 

**************
Personal theft
**************
                                                  
Personal theft rates decreased 44% between 1993 and 1998.  
The 1998 rate of 1.3 personal thefts per 1,000 persons 
was about half of the 2.3 personal thefts per 1,000 
persons recorded in 1993. 

**************
Property crime
**************

The rate of every type of property crime decreased 
between 1993 and 1998.  Household burglary decreased 
34%; motor vehicle theft decreased 43%; and theft 
decreased 31%.  

**************************
Characteristics of victims
**************************

Of the demographic categories considered, virtually all 
experienced a decrease in violent victimization between 
1993 and 1998.  For example, male violent victimization 
rates fell 39%, and black violent victimization 
rates fell 38%.  

Decreases in property crime rates occurred between 1993 
and 1998 in every demographic group considered (tables 8 
and 9).  The overall property crime rate declined at least
31% for white, black, urban, and suburban households.

Survey methodology
******************                          

Except for homicide data obtained from the FBI's Uniform 
Crime Reporting program, this Bulletin presents data from 
the NCVS.  The NCVS collects data on nonfatal crimes against
persons age 12 or older, reported and not reported to the 
police, from a nationally representative sample of households 
in the United States.  The NCVS provides information about 
victims (age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, income, 
and educational level), offenders (gender, race, approximate 
age, and victim-offender relations), and criminal offenses 
(time and place of occurrence, use of weapons, nature of 
injury, and economic consequences). 

In 1998 approximately 43,000 households and 80,000 people 
age 12 or older were interviewed.  For the 1998 NCVS data 
presented here, the response rate is 94% of eligible 
households and 89% of eligible individuals.  

The data in this Bulletin were collected during the calendar 
year being estimated.  Because of the retrospective nature 
of the survey, the estimates include some incidents that 
actually occurred during the previous year.  Analyses 
comparing the victimization information collected in a calendar 
year (termed a collection year) to that obtained about 
victimizations experienced in the same calendar year 
(called a data year) show only a small difference between 
the two methods.   For example, for 1995 the violent crime 
rate based on data year victimization was 44.5 per 1,000 
persons age 12 or older, compared to 46.6 based on the 
collection year method.  The differences will be greater 
during periods of changing crime rates and less during 
periods of stable rates.  

***************************
Standard error computations
***************************

Comparisons made in this Bulletin were tested to determine 
if observed differences were statistically significant. 
Differences described as higher, lower, or different in 
this Bulletin passed a hypothesis test at the .05 level 
of statistical significance (95% confidence level).  That 
is, the tested difference was greater than twice the standard 
error of that difference.  For comparisons which were 
statistically significant at the 0.10 level of statistical 
significance (90% confidence level), the terms somewhat 
different, marginally different, and slight difference are 
used to note the nature of the difference.  

Caution is required when comparing estimates not explicitly 
discussed in the bulletin text.  What may appear to be large 
differences may not test as statistically at the 95% or even 
the 90% confidence level.  Significance testing calculations 
were conducted at the Bureau of Justice Statistics using 
statistical programs developed specifically for the NCVS by 
the U.S. Bureau of the Census.  These programs consider the 
complex NCVS sample design when calculating generalized  
variance estimates.
