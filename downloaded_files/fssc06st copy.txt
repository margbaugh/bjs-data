The National Judicial Reporting Program
(NJRP) compiles detailed information on the
sentences that felons receive in state courts
nationwide and on characteristics of the felons.
The survey excludes federal courts and state or
local courts that do not adjudicate adult felony
cases. NJRP surveys have been conducted every
2 years since 1986. This publication presents
findings from the 2006 survey.

The 2006 NJRP was based on a sample of state
courts in 300 counties selected to be nationally
representative. The survey included offenses that
state penal codes defined as felonies. Felonies are
widely defined as crimes with the potential of
being punished by more than 1 year in prison.

In 2006, state courts sentenced an estimated
1,132,290 persons for a felony conviction. That
total represents a 37% increase from the number
of felony offenders sentenced in 1990. The number
of sentenced felons in 2006 per 100,000 adult
residents (18 or older) in the United States was
503. The corresponding rate in 1990 was 447.

During this 16-year period, state courts experienced
a rise in the average age of persons sentenced
for a felony, a trend that is reflected in the
overall U.S. population. In 1990, persons age 30
or older accounted for 74% of U.S. adult residents
and 42% of felony offenders in state courts
(not in table). By comparison, persons age 30 or
older comprised 78% of the adult U.S. population
in 2006 and 53% of felons sentenced in state
courts that year. The average age of sentenced
felons rose from 29 years in 1990 to 33 years in
2006.

Highlights

*In 2006 an estimated 69% of all persons convicted of a felony in state
 courts were sentenced to a period of confinement&ndash;41% to state prison
 and 28% to local jails.

*State prison sentences averaged 4 years and 11 months in 2006.

*Men (83%) accounted for a larger percentage of persons convicted of a felony,
 compared to their percentage (49%) of the adult population (not shown in table).

*Most (94%) felony offenders sentenced in 2006 pleaded guilty.

Section 1. Felony Sentences in State Court

*State courts sentenced an estimated 1,132,290
persons for a felony in 2006, including 206,140
(or 18% of all felony convictions) for a violent
felony (table 1.1). A drug crime was the most
serious conviction offense for about a third of
felons sentenced in state courts that year.

*In 2006 an estimated 69% of all persons convicted
of a felony in state courts were sentenced
to a period of confinement—41% to state
prison and 28% to local jails (table 1.2). Jail
sentences are usually a year or less in a county
or city facility, while prison sentences are usually
more than a year and are served in a state
facility.

*Among persons sentenced for a felony in state
courts nationwide in 2006, an estimated 27%
received a probation sentence with no jail or
prison time. Four percent of felons were not
sentenced to any incarceration or probation,
but received a sentence that included fines, restitution,
treatment, community service, or some other penalty
(for example, house arrest or periodic drug testing).

*State prison sentences averaged 4 years and
11 months in 2006 (table 1.3). Persons convicted
of a violent felony received the longest
prison sentences in 2006, compared to property,
drug, weapon, and other felonies.

*Felony sentences to jail averaged 6 months
(table 1.3). Among felons who were sentenced
in state courts to probation and no incarceration,
the average probation sentence was
3 years and 2 months.

*Life sentences accounted for less than 1%
(0.3%) of the 1.1 million felony sentences in
state courts during 2006 (table 1.4). However,
among the estimated 8,670 persons sentenced
for murder or nonnegligent manslaughter that
year, 23% received life in prison.

*Among the estimated 460,000 persons sentenced
to prison via state courts, 0.8% received
life sentences (table 1.4).

*In 2006 an estimated 38% of persons sentenced
for a felony in state courts were ordered to pay
a fine as part of their sentence (table 1.5).
Approximately 1 in 4 property offenders was
ordered to make restitution and 23% of offenders
convicted of drug possession were sentenced
to treatment. Approximately 1 in 5 rape
offenders was sentenced to treatment.

*State courts accounted for the vast majority of
all felony sentences in the United States during
2006. According to the BJS Federal Justice Statistics
Program, federal courts sentenced about
73,000 persons for a felony in 2006, which represented
about 6% of the combined state and
federal total (table 1.6).

*The average felony sentence to incarceration
(prison or jail) in state courts was about 3 years
in 2006, compared to almost 5 years and
6 months in federal courts (table 1.6). Federal
felony drug offenders received incarceration
terms (7 years and 3 months) that were more
than twice the length of incarceration terms of
state felony drug offenders (2 years and 7
months).

Section 2. Felony Offenses in State Court

*In 2006 an estimated 93% of convicted felons
were sentenced for a completed offense, and
7% were sentenced for an attempted offense
(table 2.1). By definition, murders were completed
crimes.

*About 3 out of 4 felons sentenced in 2006
(77%) were sentenced for a single offense
(table 2.2). An estimated 15% were sentenced
for two felony offenses, and 7% were sentenced
for three or more felonies. The overall number
of conviction offenses totaled about 1.5 million
for which 1,132,290 felons were sentenced in
2006 (not in table).

*In 2006 the likelihood of receiving a state
prison sentence was 37% for persons convicted
of one felony, increasing to 51% for two felonies
or 63% for three or more felonies (table 2.3).

*The mean sentence to state prison in 2006
increased from 4 years and 2 months for those
convicted of one felony to 6 years and 6 months
for those convicted of two or more felonies (table 2.4).

Section 3. Felony Offenders in State Court
*In 2006 persons in their twenties accounted for
40% of convicted felons, which was more than
double their percentage of the U.S. adult population
(18%) (table 3.1). The average age of persons
sentenced for a felony in state courts in
2006 was 33 years.

*Men (83%) accounted for a larger percentage of
persons convicted of a felony (table 3.2), compared
to their percentage (49%) of the adult
population (not shown in table). Whites comprised
82% of adults in the U.S. population,
compared to 60% of persons convicted of a felony.
Blacks comprised 12% of the adult population,
but 38% of convicted felons.

*Females comprised a relatively large proportion
of persons sentenced for a property crime
in 2006—about 1 in 4—compared to the proportion
of female felons sentenced for other
crimes (table 3.2). Approximately 1 in 5 drug
offenders and 1 in 10 violent offenders was
female.

*In 2006 an estimated 72% of males convicted of
a felony in state courts were sentenced to either
prison or jail, compared to 60% of females
(table 3.3).

*In 2006 similar proportions of whites (66%)
and blacks (72%) convicted of a felony in state
courts were sentenced to a period of confinement
(table 3.4).

*In 2006 men sentenced to state prison nationwide
had an average sentence length of 5 years
and 1 month, while women had an average
prison sentence of 3 years and 9 months
(table 3.5).

*Among felony offenders sentenced to state
prison during 2006, the average sentence
received by blacks (5 years and 3 months) was
not significantly different from the average sentence
received by whites (5 years) (table 3.6).

*Among females sentenced in state courts to
straight probation with no jail or prison time to
serve, the average probation term received by
white and black offenders in 2006 was about
3 years (table 3.7).

Section 4. Felony Adjudication in State Court
*Most (94%) felony offenders sentenced in 2006
pleaded guilty (table 4.1). The rest were found
guilty by a jury (4%) or by a judge in a bench
trial (2%). Persons convicted of murder were
the least likely to have pleaded guilty (61%) and
the most likely to have been convicted in a
trial (39%).

*During 2006 an estimated 89% of persons who
were convicted of a violent felony either by a
jury or judge were sentenced to time in prison
or jail, compared to 76% of violent offenders
who pleaded guilty (table 4.2).

*Prison sentences imposed in state courts were
longer for felons convicted in a trial (8 years
and 4 months) than for felons who pleaded
guilty (3 years and 11 months) in 2006
(table 4.3).

*Among persons convicted of murder or nonnegligent
manslaughter, sentences to life in
prison or death occurred more often in trial
convictions (47%) than in guilty pleas (13%) in
2006 (table 4.4).

*Among felons sentenced in state courts during
2006, an estimated 4% were sentenced within
1 month following their arrest, 14% were sentenced
within 3 months of their arrest, 33%
were sentenced within 6 months of their arrest,
and 67% were sentenced within 12 months of
their arrest (table 4.5). The median time from
arrest to sentencing for all felony convictions
was 265 days. The median days from arrest to
sentencing was longest for murder (505 days)
and sexual assault (348 days) convictions.

Methodology

Targeted population
Through a nationally representative sample of
state courts, the 2006 National Judicial Reporting
Program (NJRP) compiled individual-level
data on felony sentences that occurred in calendar
year 2006. Because the year of conviction
was not a defining characteristic, some cases in
the sample were of persons convicted before
2006 but not sentenced until 2006. If the same
person was sentenced for a felony more than
once during the reporting period, then each
event was counted separately.

The survey targeted and recorded initial sentences
imposed during 2006. If a person received
prison but the judge suspended that sentence on
the same day, the sentence was coded as probation
because that was the actual sentence. Any
change to a sentence after the initial sentencing
date (such as probation revocation) was ignored.

Sampling

The same sample of 300 counties drawn for the
2002 survey was used in the 2004 and 2006 surveys.
While there were 3,141 counties or county
equivalents in the nation in 2002, 36 reported
their NJRP data in combination with another
county or county equivalent. This left 3,105
jurisdictions to be divided into 20 strata. Each
county was assigned to one stratum by meeting
the conditions for that stratum.

The survey used a stratified cluster sampling
design. The largest 75 counties in the United
States (as defined by the 2000 resident population)
were separated from the 3,105 jurisdictions
(appendix table). Each state was then assigned a
cost-factor (1, 3, or 5) which reflected the overall
cost of collecting their 2000 NJRP data. Counties
in states where data collection is not costly were
assigned a 1. Counties in states where data collection
is moderately costly were assigned a 3.
Counties in states where data collection is costly
were assigned a 5.

Counties in each cost-factor group were then
separated into categories based on the size of
their 2000 population. Among the nation's largest
75 counties, those assigned a cost-factor 1
were separated into 2 strata (defined by year
2000 population size), cost-factor 3 counties
remained in one stratum, and cost-factor 5
counties were separated into 2 strata (defined by
year 2000 population size). Among counties that
were not one of the nation's largest 75, those
assigned a cost-factor of 1 were separated into
5 strata (defined by year 2000 population size).
Cost-factor 3 counties were separated into
4 strata (defined by year 2000 population size),
and cost-factor 5 counties were separated into
5 strata (defined by year 2000 population size).
Because the 75 largest counties account for a disproportionately
large amount of serious crime in
the Nation, they were given a greater chance of
being selected than the remaining counties.

Altogether, 58 out of the 75 largest counties were
sampled. All 36 counties in strata 0, 11, and 12
were selected for the sample. Strata 31, 51, and
52 consisted of the remaining 22 counties sampled
from the largest 75 counties. Strata 111, 112,
113, 114, 115, 131, 132, 133, 134, 151, 152, 153,
154, and 155 included 242 counties sampled
from among the 3,030 not among the 75 largest.

The final sample thus included 300 counties
(58 out of the 75 largest counties, and 242 out of
the remaining 3,030 counties). Seven of the
300 counties did not participate and were
replaced by other counties. The 300 included at
least one county from every state except, by
chance, Nevada, South Dakota, and Wyoming.
Two of the 300 had no felony convictions during
the 2006 survey period. In total, the 2006 survey
obtained case-level data on 494,055 convicted
felons in 300 counties selected to represent the
estimated 1,132,292 persons convicted of a felony
in state courts that year. Of these sampled
cases, 344,147 were in the 75 largest counties.

The 36 sampled counties in strata 0, 11, and 12
were self-representing only, and their sampled
cases therefore had a sampling weight of 1. The
remaining strata were selected to represent their
respective strata so that the sampled felony conviction
cases had weights greater than 1.

Sampling error

NJRP data were obtained from a sample and not
from a complete enumeration; consequently,
they are subject to sampling error. A standard
error, which is a measure of sampling error, is
associated with each number in these statistical
tables. In general, if the difference between two
numbers is at least twice the standard error of
that difference, there is at least 95% confidence
that the two numbers do in fact differ; that is, the
apparent difference is not simply the result of
surveying a sample rather than the entire population.
All differences discussed in this report
were statistically significant at or above the 95%
confidence interval.

Sources of data

State courts were the source of NJRP data for
about 44% of the 300 counties sampled. For
other counties, sources included prosecutors'
offices, sentencing commissions, and statistical
agencies.

For 298 of the 300 counties sampled, individuallevel
NJRP records were obtained in electronic
format. The other two jurisdictions provided
data through photocopies of official documents.
All data were collected and processed by the U.S.
Census Bureau.

Resident population estimates were obtained
from the National Center for Health Statistics.
Bridged-race intercensal estimates for 1990
through 1999 for United States resident population
by county, single-year of age, sex, race, and
Hispanic origin, were prepared by the U.S. Census
Bureau with support from the National Cancer
Institute. Data are available on the Internet at
<http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/dvs/
popbridge/popbridge.htm> (released on July 26,
2004). Estimates of the resident population of
the United States for 2000 through 2007, by year,
county, age, bridged race, Hispanic origin, and
sex (vintage 2007) were prepared under a collaborative
arrangement with the U.S. Census
Bureau; released August 7, 2008. Data are available
on the Internet at: <http://www.cdc.gov/
nchs/about/major/dvs/popbridge/popbridge.
htm> (accessed September 5, 2008).

Missing data

Not all jurisdictions were able to provide data for
2006. Data from 12 Minnesota counties for the
2006 survey pertain to sentences imposed in
2005. Fifteen additional counties were unable to
provide complete data files for the 2006 survey—
San Bernardino, Sonoma, and Ventura
Counties, California; Boulder, Colorado; Duval,
Florida; DuPage, Illinois; Cumberland, Maine;
Belknap, New Hampshire; Putnam, West Virginia;
and Canadian, Comanche, McClain, Rogers,
Tulsa, and Washington Counties, Oklahoma.
Consequently, the latest available data for these
jurisdictions were used in place of the 2006 data.
For 14 of the 15 counties, files submitted for the
2004 NJRP were used for the 2006 survey. Data
submitted for the 2002 NJRP were used for San
Bernardino County.

Sentencing data obtained from Montgomery
County, Ohio, were not submitted electronically
and required manual coding. To expedite data
processing, a systematic sample of cases was
drawn from the court records.

Percentages are based on reported data only.
However, estimated numbers in table 1.2.1 are
adjusted for cases missing a designation of sentence
type. The proportion of cases with valid
data are presented in the footnotes of each table
