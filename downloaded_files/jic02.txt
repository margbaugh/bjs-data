On June 28, 2002, a total of 70 jails, confinement facilities,
detention centers, and other correctional facilities were
supervising 2,080 persons in Indian country, up 2% from the
previous year. At midyear 2001, 2,030 persons were under the 
supervision of jails in Indian country.

Indian country facilities held 2,006 inmates at midyear 2002, up 
from 1,912 at mid-year 2001. Jail authorities also supervised 74 
offenders under community supervision programs. New admissions to 
jail increased from 9,697 in June 2001 to 11,822 in June 2002, a 
22% increase.  

The 70 facilities had a rated capacity to hold 2,177 persons, up 
4% since 2001. On June 28, 2002, the jails were operating at 92% 
of capacity, up from 91% at midyear 2001. On an average day in June 
2002, the jails were operating at 79% of capacity. On their peak 
day in June 2002, the 70 jails were operating at 126% of capacity, 
unchanged from 2001. The number of inmates on the peak day in June 
has increased 19% since 1998.  

At midyear 2002 more than a third of the offenders were held
for a violent offense, 15% specifically for domestic violence.
Eleven percent of all offenders (226) were being held for
DWI/DUI.

These data are based on the 2002 Survey of Jails in Indian Country 
(SJIC). The survey includes all jails, confinement facilities, 
detention centers, and other correctional facilities located in 
Indian country and operated by tribal authorities or the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. Department of the Interior.

Tribes retain jurisdiction over many crimes 
by American Indians and Alaska Natives in 
Indian country

Thirty-three States contain approximately 300 Indian land areas or
reservations. Generally, the local governing authority on Indian 
lands is a tribal government or council. Jurisdiction over crimes in 
Indian country depends on several factors, including the identity of 
the victim and the offender, the severity of the crime, and where the 
crime was committed. (See box below.) Tribal authority to sentence
offenders is limited to 1 year of imprisonment and a $5,000 fine or 
both (25 U.S.C. sec 1302(7)). 

City or county jails held 3 times as many American Indians as jails 
in Indian country. (American Indians in this report includes Alaska 
Natives.) At midyear 2002 local jails held an estimated 6,000 
American Indians, some of whom may have been adjudicated by a tribal 
criminal justice system and housed in jails under contract with tribal
governments.  Overall, State, Federal, local, and tribal authorities 
were supervising 47,724 American Indians. Most were under community
supervision (25,479).

A total of 22,245 American Indians were in custody at midyear 2002, 
most of whom were held in State prison (12,924).

victim, type of offense, and where the crime was committed.
-------------------------------------------------------------

On July 1, 2002, 2,752,158 American Indians and Alaska Natives lived 
in the Unites States (U.S. Census Bureau, National Populations 
Estimates, table NA-EST2002-ASRO-04). American Indians account for 
under 1% of the U.S. resident population and around 1% of those in
custody of jails or prisons.

At midyear 2002 the rate of incarceration in prison and jail for
American Indians was about 15% higher than the overall national rate. 
Federal and State prison and jail authorities held 808 American 
Indians per 100,000 Indians, compared to 702 persons of all races per 
100,000 U.S. residents. 

Indian country jail population rose 5% between 
July 2001 and June 2002 

At midyear 2002 jails in Indian country supervised 2,080 persons, up 
from 2,030 in 2001. Nearly all (2,006) were held in jails, with an 
additional 74 persons being supervised in the community. The number 
of inmates in custody increased 5% from the previous year, when 1,912 
inmates were being housed.

Persons under community supervision  decreased 37%(74 in 2002 down 
from 118 in 2001).  

Overall, the number of persons held in Indian country jails fluctuated 
between June 2001 and June 2002.  Although the population increased 
during the 12 months, June of each year was among the months with 
the largest custody counts. In 2002 the smallest jail inmate 
population occurred in February -- based on 62 jails and excluding 
8 facilities unable to report complete data. 

86% of confined inmates held for misdemeanors

On June 28, 2002, jails in Indian country held 1,120 convicted
offenders and 857 inmates who were unconvicted or awaiting trial. 
Fifty-seven percent of those jailed in 2002 were convicted, down 
from 61% at midyear 2000 and 75% in 1999.

At midyear 2002, 1,725 inmates were being held for a misdemeanor down 
from 1,738 at midyear 2001. One hundred seven inmates were in jail for 
a felony, a 5% decrease from 2001. Five inmates were being held for 
the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, formerly the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, for deportation, and 169 for 
other reasons, including protective custody, detoxification, public
intoxication, status offenses, and pending charges. 

35% of inmates held for violent offenses; 15% for
domestic violence

At midyear 2002, 699 inmates (35% of all inmates) were being held for 
a violent offense. Of these, 291 (15% of all inmates)were confined for
domestic violence. Overall, 11% of inmates at midyear 2002 were confined 
for driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence of alcohol 
or drugs, up from 9% in 2001. Approximately 6% of inmates (126)were
being held for a drug law violation, down from 7%(130)in 2001.  

At midyear 2002 Indian country jails held 1,699 adults, 82% males and 
18% females. Juveniles (persons under age 18)accounted for 15% of the 
total custody population. More than 71% of juveniles were males; 29% 
were females. At midyear 2002, 11 juveniles were being held as adults, 
down from 22 at midyear 2001. 

Between June 1 and June 30, 2002, 11,822 persons were admitted to jails 
in Indian country, a 22% increase over the same period in 2001. Since

5 years, the number of admissions rose 32%, and the annual number of 
attempted suicides more than doubled (from 133 to 282 ); however, the 
number of completed suicides remained unchanged (3 in 1998 and 3 in 
2002.)

The 10 largest jails held 39% of inmates in Indian 
country

On June 28, 2002, the 10 largest jails in Indian country housed 790 
inmates. Combined, the 10 facilities had a rated capacity to hold

Indian country. Seventy-nine percent (621) of the inmates in the 10 
largest jails were confined in 7 facilities in Arizona. 

Gila River Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and Tohono 
O'odham Detention Center each held over 100 inmates. Pine Ridge 
Correctional Facility in South Dakota which held 168 inmates at midyear 
2001,held 55 at midyear 2002.  On June 28, 2002, the number of inmates 
at Tohono O'odham Detention Center was 3 times its operating capacity. 
Gila River Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was operating 
below its rated capacity (61%). 

56% of jails housed fewer  than 25 inmates

in cells designed for multiple occupants; 10% were double bunked in 
single cells; 2% were housed in areas not originally intended for 
confinement, and 2% were in holding areas or "drunk tanks." Ten 
percent of all inmates were housed in single cells or rooms.

Forty-two facilities were operating above 100% of capacity in
June 2002, up from 40 the previous year. Nineteen jails were
operating at over 150% of capacity on their peak day in June

Ridge Correctional Facility, and Tohono O'odham Detention
Center.  

Small facilities reported the highest occupancy 
rates 

Nine facilities with a rated capacity to hold fewer than 10
inmates reported the highest occupancy rates (179%) on their 
peak day in June 2002. Occupancy was 156% of capacity in jails 
rated to hold 10 to 24 inmates, 130% in jails rated to hold 25

Seven jails were under multiple court orders or consent decrees to 
limit the number of inmates they can house and for conditions of 
inmate confinement. Six facilities were ordered to detain inmates 
in a humane condition: Wind River Police Department and Navajo 
Department of Corrections in Chinle, Tuba City, Window Rock, 
Crownpoint, and Shiprock. The Navajo Department of Corrections in 
Chinle and Tuba City were also ordered to hold inmates only 
temporarily. The Pascua Yaqui Law Enforcement Center was ordered to
separate adults and juveniles by sight and sound. 

Four facilities completed construction since 
July 1, 2001

Among all facilities, 67 reported the year in which the original
construction was completed. The original year of construction
ranged from 1929, at the Fort Hall Police Department in Idaho, to 
2001 at 4 facilities: Chinle Youth Corrections in Arizona, Fort 
Mohave Tribal Police Department in Arizona, Lac View Desert Police 
Department in Michigan, and the Rocky Boy Police Department in 
Montana. Overall at midyear 2002, jails in Indian country had an 
average age of 22 years. Since the time of original construction, 
40 facilities have received major renovations. Twenty-five 
facilities were renovated between 1982 and 1999. Fifteen facilities 
were renovated after 1999: 2 in 2000, 6 in 2001, and 7 in 2002.

Jails employed more than 2,100 persons at 
midyear 2002 

Indian country jails employed 2,115 persons on June 28, 2002, 
including payroll, nonpayroll, and contract staff. Over 33% 
(711) of all employees were jail operations staff (correctional 
officers and other staff who spend more than 50% of their time 
supervising inmates). Jails in Indian country also employed 208 
administrative employees, 288 technical or professional staff, 
and 168 clerical, maintenance, or food service staff. In addition, 
737 employees (35%) were classified as field operations staff, 
including patrol officers and other staff who spend more than 50% 
of their time in the field. 

At midyear 2002 there were approximately 2.5 inmates for every 
jail operations employee, down from 2.6 at midyear 1998. In 1999, 
when the last national jail census was conducted, the U.S. average 
among all local jails was 4.0 inmates per correctional officer. 
Small jails holding 50 or fewer inmates held an average of 2.0 
inmates per correctional officer. 

Jails hired 448 new payroll staff between 
July 2001 and June 2002

During the 12-month period ending June 30, 2002, jail administrators 
hired a total of 448 new payroll staff, including persons rehired or 
recalled from layoff. The Walter Minor Law Enforcement Center (adult 
and juvenile, combined) hired the most new staff (79), followed by 
Warm Springs Detention Center (22) and White Buffalo Youth Detention 
Center (20). Five facilities reported no new hires during the period.

At midyear 2002, Indian country jails reported 233 staff vacancies. 
White Mountain Apache Police Department(24)and Gila River Department 
of Corrections and Rehabilitation (19) reported the largest number 
of vacancies. A total of 21 of the 67 facilities reporting data had 
no staff vacancies at the end of June 2002. 

Methodology

"Indian country" is a statutory term that includes the following:
all lands within an Indian reservation, dependent Indian
communities, and Indian trust allotments (18 U.S.C. sec 1151). 
Courts interpret sec 1151 to include all lands held in trust for 
tribes or their members. See United States v. Roberts. 185 F.3d 
1125(10th Cir. 1999). Tribal authority to imprison Indian offenders 
is limited to 1 year per offense by statute (25 U.S.C. sec 1302).

Tribal law enforcement agencies act as first responders to both 
felony and misdemeanor crimes. For most of Indian country, the 
Federal Government provides felony law enforcement concerning 
crimes by or against Indians. Certain areas of Indian country are 
under Public Law 83-280, as amended. P.L. 280 conferred jurisdiction 
on certain States over "Indian country" and suspended enforcement of 
the Major Crimes Act(18 U.S.C. sec 1153) and the General Crimes Act 
(18 U.S.C. sec 1152) in those areas. Indian tribes retain concurrent
jurisdiction to enforce laws in Indian country where P.L. 280 applies.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducted the Survey
of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) to describe all adult and
juvenile jail facilities and detention centers in Indian country.
For purposes of this report, Indian country includes reservations, 
pueblos, rancherias, and other appropriate areas (18 U.S.C. sec 
1151). The reference date for the most recent survey is June 28, 
2002.

The SJIC was initiated in 1998 as a component of the Annual
Survey of Jails (ASJ). The ASJ is conducted in each of the
years between the Census of Jails. The 2002 ASJ consisted
of a sample survey of 826 local jail jurisdictions, a survey of
the Nation's 50 multi-jurisdictional facilities, and a survey of
the 70 facilities in Indian country. (For sampling information,
see Prison and Jails Inmates at Midyear 2002, BJS Bulletin,
April 2003, <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ bjs/abstract/pjim02.htm>.)

In 1998 the Office of Law Enforcement Services, Bureau of
Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. Department of the Interior, provided
a complete list of 74 Indian country jail facilities. The list
included detention centers, jails, and other correctional
facilities, operated by tribal authorities or the BIA. Since 1998,
3 facilities were added, 3 were closed, 2 facilities were
abandoned, 2 were combined into 1 facility, and 1 was determined 
not to be a jail facility, resulting in 70 surveyed facilities. 
The facilities are in 19 States and are affiliated with 55 tribes.  

Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Through follow-up phone 
calls and facsimiles, 68 of 70 facilities responded. Data for the 
Navajo Department of Corrections in Window Rock and Shiprock are 
from June 29, 2001.
