Highlights

* In 2002 an estimated 8.7% of drivers age 16 or older were
stopped by police, representing nearly 17 million of the
193 million drivers in the United States.

* Males were more likely than females to be pulled over by
police, and young drivers were more likely than their older
counterparts to be stopped.

* White drivers were more likely than both black and
Hispanic drivers to be stopped by police for speeding.
Subsequent to being stopped for speeding, blacks(78%)and 
Hispanics(85%)were more likely than whites(70%)to receive 
a ticket. 

* Among traffic stops of young male drivers in 2002, 11%
were physically searched or had their vehicle searched by
police. Among these young male drivers who were stopped,
blacks (22%) and Hispanics(17%)were searched at higher 
rates than whites (8%).

* Of the estimated 329,000 drivers who were both searched
and arrested during a traffic stop, police found evidence
of criminal wrongdoing in approximately 20% of cases.

* In 2002 an estimated 45.3 million people had a face-to-
face contact with police; of these, 1.5% indicated police 
used or threatened force during the contact. 

* Drivers stopped by police (1.1%) were less likely than
persons who had other types of face-to-face contacts with
police (1.7%) to indicate police used or threatened force
against them. 

* Among drivers involved in a traffic stop who also
indicated police used or threatened force against them, 
87% characterized the force as excessive.
--------------------------------------------------

Drivers in the United States totaled 192.7 million persons
in 2002, or about 89% of the 215.5 million U.S. residents
age 16 or older. Approximately 16.8 million, or 8.7%, of
those drivers were stopped by police at least once that
year. These traffic stops include stops of all kinds of
motor vehicles -- motorcycles, buses, and private and
commercial cars and trucks -- and both personal and 
business travel. These findings come from the 2002 Police-
Public Contact Survey (PPCS).

Driver characteristics

Driver gender

The 192.7 million residents who represent the U.S. driving
population were evenly divided between males and females.
By contrast, of the 16.8 million drivers stopped by police
in 2002, males(60.8%)were more likely than females (39.2%)
to be among those stopped. 

Driver age

Young drivers were more likely to be pulled over by police
than older drivers. One measure of this difference is that 
young drivers age 16 to 24 were a larger percentage (26%) 
of drivers stopped by police than they were of drivers in 
the United States (15.3%).

Driver race/Hispanic origin

In 2002 whites, blacks, and Hispanics were stopped by police
at similar rates. Specifically, each group represented
approximately the same percentage of stopped drivers as they
did of drivers in the United States. For example --

* whites were 76.2% of U.S. drivers and 76.5% of drivers
stopped by police 

* blacks were 10.5% of persons who drive and 11% of stopped
drivers

* Hispanics accounted for 9.7% of drivers and 9.5% of
stopped drivers.

Drivers of other races were a smaller percentage of stopped
motorists (2.9%) than of the driving population (3.6%).

Driver gender, age, and race/Hispanic origin

Young white male, young black male, and young Hispanic male
drivers were all more likely to be pulled over by police
than their older counterparts. Each of these groups of
younger male drivers was a larger percentage of drivers
stopped by police in 2002 than of the U.S. driving population.

--------------------------------------------
Racial differences in traffic stops 
may not signal racial profiling 

To form evidence of racial profiling, survey findings would
have to demonstrate (all other things being equal) -- 

Blacks and/or Hispanics were no more likely than whites to
violate traffic laws, and Police pulled over blacks and/or
Hispanics at a higher rate
than whites.

Because the survey has information only on how often persons
of different races are stopped, not on how often they
actually break traffic laws, analysis of data from the 2002 
Police-Public Contact Survey has no basis for determining 
whether or to what extent racial profiling exists.
------------------------------------------------------

Likelihood of drivers being stopped

The likelihood of being pulled over in 2002 did not differ
among white (8.7%), black (9.1%), and Hispanic (8.6%)
drivers.

Among both male and female drivers, younger drivers age 16
to 24 were more likely than drivers age 25 or older to
be stopped by police. In addition --

* young white male drivers (18.8%) were more likely than
their older counterparts (9.3%) to be stopped by police

* among Hispanic males, younger drivers were pulled over at
higher rates (17%) than older drivers (8.5%).

No real difference in the probability of being stopped was
found between younger (14.6%) and older (10.2%) black male
drivers. 

Driver opinion on being stopped

An estimated 83.7% of drivers stopped by police, or about 14
million drivers, felt they were pulled over for a
legitimate reason. While the majority of drivers felt the
police were justified in stopping them, opinion was not
uniform across different segments of the population.

Young male drivers were less likely than other stopped
drivers to feel they were pulled over for a legitimate
reason. Among these young male drivers, blacks(57.9%)were 
less likely than both whites (81%)or Hispanics(81%)to 
feel the stop was legitimate.

-----------------------------------------
Comparing estimates from the
1999 and 2002 surveys 

In 1999 the Police-Public Contact Survey found that 10.3% of
licensed drivers were stopped by police. In 2002 the survey 
found that 8.7% of drivers in the United States were pulled 
over by police. Due to changes to the survey instrument, 
these two estimates are based on different denominators. 
Because of this difference in the denominators, these two 
estimates of the likelihood of drivers being stopped by 
police are not directly comparable. See Methodology on page 
10 for more information.
--------------------------------------------------

Drivers not informed of reason 
for traffic stop

A relatively small percentage of stopped drivers (2.1%)
indicated police did not give a reason for pulling them
over.

No differences were found by gender or age in whether 
police informed drivers of the reason for being stopped.

Blacks(4.5%)were more likely than whites (1.8%) and
somewhat more likely than Hispanics (2.3%) to indicate
police did not give them a reason for being stopped.

Drivers stopped for speeding

The chances that a driver in the United States will be
pulled over by police for speeding are relatively low. In
2002, 4.8% of the 192.7 million drivers in the United States
indicated police stopped them for speeding.

Among stopped drivers, however, speeding was the leading
reason for being pulled over by police in 2002, cited by
more than half (54.8%) of stopped drivers. 

Driver gender 

Of all the Nation's drivers, males (5.6%) were more likely
than females (4%) to be stopped by police for speeding.

Among all drivers stopped by police, female drivers (58.2%)
were more likely than male drivers (52.6%) to indicate
speeding was the reason for the stop.

Driver age 

Of all the Nation's drivers, younger drivers (8.5%) were
more likely than older drivers (4.1%) to be stopped by
police for speeding. 

Among all drivers stopped by police in 2002, younger drivers
(57.6%) were slightly more likely than older drivers (53.8%) 
to report police stopped them for speeding.

Driver race/Hispanic origin

Of all the drivers in the United States, whites (5%) were
more likely than Hispanics (3.8%) and somewhat more likely
than blacks (4.4%) to report being pulled over by police for
speeding.  

Among drivers stopped by police, whites (57.2%) were more
likely than both blacks (48%) and Hispanics (44.3%) to
indicate speeding was the reason for the stop.

Driver gender, age, and race/Hispanic 
origin

Of the 10.3 million young white male drivers in the United
States, 10.9% were stopped for speeding compared to 8.5%
of the 10.1 million young white female drivers. Among
drivers stopped by police, young white male drivers (58.3%)
were less likely than their female counterparts (67.6%) to
indicate speeding as the reason for the stop.

Among the Nation's drivers, white females age 16 to 24
(8.5%) were more likely than their black (5.7%) and Hispanic
(3.9%) counterparts to indicate speeding as the reason for
being stopped.   

Among young male drivers in the United States, whites
(10.9%) were more likely than both blacks (5.4%) and
Hispanics (7.5%) to indicate they were stopped for 
speeding.

Of drivers stopped by police, white males age 16 to 24
(58.3%) were more likely than black (36.9%) and Hispanic
(43.8%) males in the same age group to report speeding as
the reason for being stopped.

Drivers stopped for speeding 
who were ticketed

Drivers stopped for speeding were more likely to be ticketed
than other stopped drivers. According to Contacts between
Police and the Public: Findings from the 2002 National
Survey, 58.6% of all drivers stopped by police were 
ticketed. Among drivers stopped for speeding, 72.5% were 
ticketed.

The percentage of ticketed speeders does not necessarily
indicate that those speeders who were ticketed by police
were actually issued a ticket for speeding. The 2002 PPCS
did not ask respondents who were ticketed to identify the
specific reason for receiving the ticket. A driver stopped
for speeding could have been ticketed for a different reason, 
such as a broken headlight or failure to wear a seat belt.
The analysis can only determine the reason a ticketed driver
was pulled over, not the reason the police cited for issuing
the ticket.  

Driver gender 

Males (74.8%) stopped for speeding were more likely than
females (69.3%) to be ticketed.

Driver age 

Younger drivers (74.4%) and older drivers (71.8%) stopped
for speeding were about equally likely to receive a ticket.

Driver race/Hispanic origin 

Among drivers stopped for speeding, police were more likely
to ticket blacks (77.5%) and Hispanics (84.5%) than whites 
(70.3%). 

Police searches

During a traffic stop the police sometimes conduct a search
of the vehicle, the driver, or both the vehicle and the
driver. In 2002, 5% of traffic stops involved a search of the
driver, the vehicle, or both. This 5% figure in 2002 
represents a decrease from 1999, when an estimated 6.6% of 
traffic stops resulted in some kind of search.***Footnote 3: 
See Characteristics of Drivers Stopped by Police, 1999, NCJ
191548, March 2002.***

Searching the driver, vehicle, 
or both

Police conducted approximately 838,000 searches of drivers
and vehicles in 2002. Black (10.2%) and Hispanic (11.4%)
drivers stopped by police were more likely than white (3.5%)
drivers to be physically searched or have their vehicle
searched.

Search rates for young black male and young Hispanic male
drivers did not change between 1999 and 2002. Approximately 
1 in 5 young black male and young Hispanic male drivers 
stopped by police were searched in 1999, as well as 2002. 

Among drivers stopped in 2002, young black and young
Hispanic males were more likely than young white males to
be searched. Approximately 21.7% of young black male stopped
drivers and 16.8% of young Hispanic male stopped drivers had 
their vehicle and/or person searched, compared to 8.2% of 
young white male stopped drivers.

Among stopped male drivers age 25 or older, blacks (13.8%)
and Hispanics (12.9%) were more likely to be searched than 
whites (4%).

Black and Hispanic male drivers age 25 or older were 4.8%
and 4%, respectively, of all drivers stopped by police but
accounted for larger percentages -- 13.1% and 10.3%,
respectively -- of drivers who had their vehicle and/or
person searched.

White male drivers age 25 or older were a smaller percentage
of all searches (27.4%) than of drivers stopped by police
in 2002 (34.5%). 

Searching the driver

Young male drivers age 16 to 24 (9%) were more likely than
their older counterparts (4.1%) to experience a physical
search by police.

Among these young stopped male drivers, no real difference
was found between blacks (21.2%) and Hispanics (15.5%) in 
their likelihood of being physically searched, while both
groups were more likely than young white male stopped
drivers (6.1%) to experience a personal search.

Young male drivers experienced disproportionately high rates
of personal searches by police.  Young white, black and
Hispanic male drivers were 11.6%, 1.5% and 2.5%, respectively, 
of stopped motorists but were 19.5%, 8.7% and 10.8%, 
respectively, of drivers who experienced personal searches.    

Among stopped male drivers age 25 or older, blacks (10%) and
Hispanics (8.8%) were more likely than whites (2.9%)
to be personally searched. 

Black and Hispanic male drivers age 25 or older were 4.8%
and 4%, respectively, of all traffic stops but accounted for
larger percentages -- 13.1% and 9.5%, respectively -- of all
physical searches. By contrast, older white male drivers
were 34.5% of stopped drivers but a smaller 27.4% of personal 
searches.

Searching the vehicle

Among young stopped male drivers, Hispanics (14.9%) were
more likely to have their vehicles searched than whites
(6.8%). 

Among older stopped male drivers, whites (3.1%) had their
vehicles searched less frequently than both blacks (10%)
and Hispanics (11.5%).

Black and Hispanic male drivers age 25 or older were 4.8%
and 4%, respectively, of drivers pulled over by police, but
accounted for 11.8% and 11.4% of vehicle searches.  

Searched drivers who were also 
arrested

Police searched an estimated 838,000 drivers in 2002. Of
these searched drivers, 39.3% were also arrested. About
half of these 329,000 searched and arrested drivers were
searched after police arrested them, while more than a third
were searched prior to being arrested. About a tenth of
stopped drivers did not know whether the search or the
arrest occurred first (not in a table).

Driver gender

Male drivers who were searched by police (39%) were about as
likely as searched females (41.6%) to be arrested.

Driver age 

Drivers age 25 or older (45%) who were searched by police
were more likely to be arrested than their younger
counterparts (31.3%).

Driver gender and race/Hispanic origin

Among drivers who were stopped and searched, no measurable
differences were found in the likelihood of arrest among 
white, black, and Hispanic male drivers. (See Methodology 
section for information on significance testing.)

Searches of arrested and 
nonarrested drivers

In many jurisdictions police officers are required to search
the vehicle, driver, or both when making an arrest during
a traffic stop. Consequently, arrested drivers may have
experienced a vehicle and/or personal search as a procedural
step during the arrest process.

Of the 448,000 drivers arrested during a traffic stop, 73.8%
experienced a vehicle and/or personal search. A smaller
percentage of nonarrested drivers were searched (3.1%). 

Driver gender

Among stopped drivers who were arrested, males (75.2%) and
females (66.8%) were searched at similar rates. Of
stopped drivers who were not arrested, males (4.5%) were
more likely than females (1.1%) to be searched.

Driver age

Among drivers arrested by police in 2002, no difference was
found between younger (77.3%) and older (72.2%) drivers in 
their likelihood of experiencing a personal or vehicle
search.

Among nonarrested drivers, younger drivers (5.6%) were more
likely to be searched than older drivers (2.2%). 

Driver race/Hispanic origin

Among arrested motorists, no measurable difference was found
between whites, blacks, and Hispanics in their likelihood of 
being searched. (See Methodology section for information on 
significance testing.)    

Among nonarrested motorists --

* Blacks (5.9%) and Hispanics (8.8%) were searched at higher
rates than whites (2.1%).

* Hispanics (8.8%) were searched at somewhat higher rates
than blacks (5.9%).

* Among males, blacks (9.1%) and Hispanics (10.9%) were more
likely than whites (3.1%) to be searched.

--------------------------------------------
Likelihood of finding criminal evidence in a traffic stop
search

Of the nearly 838,000 searches conducted following a traffic
stop in 2002, about 1 in 10 uncovered criminal evidence, such 
as illegal weapons or drugs (not in a table). Approximately 
329,000 drivers who were searched were also arrested. Of 
these searches in conjunction with an arrest, the search 
turned up evidence of criminal wrongdoing in about 20% of 
cases.
---------------------------------------------

Police use of force

In addition to gathering data on contacts between police and
the public during traffic stops, the 2002 PPCS also
collected information on other face-to-face contacts with
police. Other face-to-face contacts include situations in
which the respondent contacted police (for instance to report 
a crime or to ask for assistance) as well as situations in
which police initiated contact with the respondent (for 
instance to investigate a crime, serve a warrant, or 
disseminate crime prevention information). 

Survey findings indicate an estimated 45.3 million people
had a face-to-face contact with police during 2002. Of that
45.3 million, 16.8 million were drivers in a traffic stop,
and 28.5 million were involved in other forms of contact
with police. 

One purpose of the PPCS was to gather information about
police use of force during both traffic stops and other
face-to-face contacts between police and the public.
Specifically, respondents were asked whether the police
officer(s)used or threatened to use force against them. 
Of the nearly 45.3 million people who had a face-to-face 
contact with police, approximately 1.5% indicated police 
used or threatened force during the contact (hereafter, 
"use of force" includes force and threat of force). The 
2002 estimate of 1.5% experiencing the use or threat of
force by police represents an increase from approximately
1% in 1999.

Drivers stopped by police (1.1%) were less likely than persons 
who had other types of face-to-face contacts with police (1.7%) 
to indicate police used or threatened force against them.  

Use of force during traffic stops

Approximately 664,500 persons age 16 or older had force used
or threatened against them by police at least once during 
2002. About a quarter of these force contacts involved a 
driver during a traffic stop.

Driver gender

An estimated 520,000 males were threatened with force or had
force used against them by police in 2002. About a third
(31.2%) of these males were drivers in a traffic stop. 

Driver age

For both younger and older persons against whom force was
used or threatened, about the same proportion of force
contacts involved a driver during a traffic stop (26.5% and
30%, respectively).

Driver race/Hispanic origin

For whites, blacks and Hispanics who experienced police use
of force, no differences were found in the proportion of
force contacts that occurred during a traffic stop. (See
Methodology section for information on significance testing.)

Use of force during traffic stops 
and other face-to-face contacts

Police used or threatened force against an estimated 189,000
drivers during a traffic stop in 2002. An additional 476,000 
persons experienced force during other types of face-to-face 
contacts with police. 

Driver gender

Males were more likely than females to have reported police
used or threatened force against them. In 2002 males were 53% 
of all persons with police contact but 78% of those who 
experienced force by police. 

Males accounted for a slightly larger percentage of traffic
stop force contacts (86%) than other contacts involving
police use of force (75.2%).  

Driver age

Younger persons were more likely than older persons to
experience force during a contact with police. The
percentage of young people involved in a force incident 
(44.9%) was almost  twice as high as their percentage of 
all contacts with police in 2002 (22.9%). By comparison, 
their older counterparts accounted for a smaller percentage 
(55.1%) of force incidents compared to their percentage of 
all contacts with police (77.1%).

Young people were not more likely to indicate that force was
used or threatened against them during a traffic stop (41.8%) 
than during other face-to-face contacts with police (46.1%).  

Driver race/Hispanic origin

Whites were less likely than blacks and Hispanics to have
force used or threatened against them. In 2002 whites were
76.7% of persons who had contact with police and 56.3% of
persons who had force used against them.

By contrast, blacks were 11% of police-public contacts but
26% of force contacts, and Hispanics were 9.3% of
police-public contacts but 15.5% of contacts involving
police use of force.

White persons were as likely to indicate that force was used
or threatened against them during a traffic stop (51%) as
during other face-to-face contacts with police (58.3%).

A similar percentage of blacks were involved in traffic stop
force contacts (26.1%) as other contacts involving police
use of force (25.9%).

Conduct of persons who had contact 
with police and the likelihood 
police used force 

Approximately 706,000 persons age 16 or older indicated they
argued with, cursed at, insulted, or verbally threatened
the police at some point during the contact. An estimated
22.8% of persons who engaged in one or more of these
behaviors also reported that police used or threatened to
use force against them. The data cannot determine whether
the person's conduct led to or was in response to the use 
or threat of force by police.

Drivers involved in traffic stops who argued with, cursed
at, insulted, or verbally threatened the police were less
likely (15.3%) to have force used against them than persons
involved in other nondriver contacts with police who behaved
in this manner (26.7%).

Use of excessive force

Overall, about three-quarters (75.4%) of persons who
experienced force felt the physical force used or threatened
against them was excessive (table 16). Drivers who had force
used against them during a traffic stop (87%) were more
likely to report that the force was excessive than persons
who experienced force during other types of contacts with
police (70.8%).

Of all persons who had contact with police in 2002, 
approximately 1.1% indicated police used or threatened to
use excessive force against them. The percentage of persons 
who felt police used excessive force did not differ by the 
type of contact. Among drivers stopped by police, about 1%
reported that police used or threatened excessive force.
Similarly, excessive force was reported by 1.2% of persons
involved in other contacts with police.

Methodology

The 2002 PPCS was conducted as a supplement to the National
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). During the last 6 months 
of 2002, the NCVS sample consisted of 93,410 individuals 
age 16 or older. About 18% of the NCVS sample, or 16,500 
individuals, were excluded from the 2002 PPCS as non-
interviews or as proxy interviews. 

Of interviews excluded from the survey, 13,618 were
classified as NCVS non-interviews. Non-interviews include
respondents not available for the PPCS interview, those who
refused to participate in the PPCS, and non-English
speaking respondents (PPCS interviews, unlike NCVS
interviews, are only conducted in English). The remainder
were the 2,882 excluded proxy interviews. A proxy interview 
may be conducted when a person is unable, for physical, mental,
or other reasons, to participate. BJS staff determined that
proxy interviewees would have difficulty describing the
details of any contacts between police and the sampled 
respondent, and the decision was made to exclude all proxy
interviews.

In total, the PPCS failed to interview 16,500 persons and
interviewed 76,910; this translates into an 82% response
rate among individuals eligible for the PPCS, compared to an
overall response rate of 87% for the NCVS. Among the PPCS
interviews conducted, 25,993 (34%) were in person and 50,917
(66%) were by telephone. The PPCS sample, after adjustment 
for nonresponse, weights to a national estimate of 215,536,780 
persons age 16 or older in 2002. 

Comparing estimates from the 1999 
and 2002 surveys

While both the 1999 and 2002 studies found about 1 in 10
drivers were stopped, these estimates are not directly
comparable due to changes to the survey instrument between
1999 and 2002 in the measurement of the number of
drivers. Most notably, the denominator used to calculate the
likelihood of being stopped by police was "licensed drivers"
in 1999, as estimated by the U.S. Department of Transportation's 
1995 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey. However, in 
2002 the denominator was changed to "drivers in the United States," 
as estimated directly from responses to newly added questions 
included in the 2002 Police-Public Contact Survey. The 
denominator change was made to account for all persons who drive, 
licensed and not licensed, to better approximate the number of 
persons at risk of being stopped by police. Excluded from the new 
denominator were licensed drivers who indicated they never drive.

The number of drivers stopped by police was also estimated
differently. In 1999, respondents were asked whether they
had been a driver stopped by police at any time during the
previous 12 months. Any respondent who had been pulled
over in a traffic stop was then included in the count of the
number of drivers stopped by police, regardless of whether
the traffic stop was their most recent contact with police.
In 2002, the survey was changed so that respondents were
asked only about their most recent contact with police
during the previous 12 months. Respondents whose most recent
face-to-face contact was not a traffic stop, but who had
been pulled over by police earlier in the year, were not
included in the count of the number of drivers stopped by police. 
Due to this change in the survey, the estimated number of
drivers stopped by police was smaller in 2002 than in 1999.
Estimates of the characteristics of drivers stopped by
police, such as the percentage of drivers searched or
ticketed, were unaffected by these changes, and remain
comparable between 1999 and 2002.

Statistical significance

In comparisons indicated in the text, an explicit or implied
difference indicates a test of significance was conducted,
and the difference was significant at the .05-level. Certain
differences were not significant at the .05-level but were
significant at the .10-level. The terms "somewhat" and
"slightly" refer to differences significant at the .10-level. 
The report also indicates that some comparisons were not
different, meaning the difference between the two estimates
was not significant at either the .05- or .10-levels.

Racial designations

Regarding racial designations given in the report, "white"
refers to non- Hispanic whites, "black" refers to
non-Hispanic blacks, and "other races" refers to non-Hispanics 
in the "other races" category. White Hispanics, black Hispanics,
and Hispanics of "other races" are categorized in the report
under the heading "Hispanic."

Due to small samples and concerns about confidentiality, the
report does not provide separate statistics on each racial
category that makes up "other races" (Asians, Native
Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and Alaska
Natives).
