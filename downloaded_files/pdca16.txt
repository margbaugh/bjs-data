DATA COLLECTION PROFILE

Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003
************************************

**************************************** 
PREA Data Collection Activities, 2016
**************************************** 

The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA; P.L. 108-79)
requires the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to carry out, for
each calendar year, a comprehensive statistical review and
analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape. The act
further specifies that the review and analysis shall be based on
a random sample, or other scientifically appropriate sample of
not less than 10% of all prisons, and a representative sample of
municipal prisons.

In 2015, more than 7,600 prisons, jails, community-based
facilities, and juvenile correctional facilities nationwide were
covered by PREA. The act requires the Attorney General to
submit—no later than June 30 of each year—a report that lists
institutions in the sample and ranks them according to the
incidence of prison rape. BJS has developed a multiple-measure,
multiple-mode data collection strategy to fully implement
requirements under PREA.

DATA COLLECTIONS DURING 2015 AND 2016
***************************************

The Survey of Sexual Victimization (SSV), formerly known
as the Survey of Sexual Violence, collects data annually from
administrative records on incidents of sexual victimization in
adult and juvenile correctional facilities. The first of a series
of data collections implemented to meet PREA mandates, this
collection began in 2004. The survey includes measures of five
different types of sexual victimization and is administered to
a sample of at least 10% of all correctional facilities covered
under PREA. It collects additional detail on the characteristics
of substantiated incidents of sexual victimization.

The administrative records surveys provide a basis for the
annual statistical review required under PREA. The surveys
include all federal and state prison systems, as well as facilities
operated by the U.S. military and Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE). The surveys also include representative
samples of jail jurisdictions, privately operated adult prisons
and jails, and jails in Indian country. Each year, the SSV also
includes all state-owned or -operated juvenile facilities and
a representative sample of locally and privately operated
juvenile facilities.

BJS published two reports in January 2016: Sexual
Victimization Reported by Juvenile Correctional Authorities,
2007–12 (NCJ 249145) and Survey of Sexual Violence in
Juvenile Correctional Facilities, 2007–12 - Statistical Tables
(NCJ 249143).

Among the findings--

* Administrators of state juvenile correctional facilities
reported 865 allegations of sexual victimization in
2012—a significant increase from the 735 allegations
reported in 2011 and 690 in 2010.

* The number of youth held in state juvenile systems
declined sharply, from 38,580 at yearend 2006 to 19,095 at
yearend 2012. As a result, the rate of sexual victimization
allegations per 1,000 youth held in state juvenile systems
more than doubled, from 19 per 1,000 youth in 2005 to
47 per 1,000 in 2012.

* Administrators of local or private and Indian country
juvenile facilities reported 613 allegations of sexual
victimization in 2012. Based on 2-year rolling averages,
the rate in 2012 was 13.5 per 1,000 youth—up from 7.2 per
1,000 in 2010.

* From 2007 to 2012, nearly 9,500 allegations of sexual
victimization of youth were reported in state or local
and private facilities. Fifty-five percent involved
youth-on-youth sexual victimization and 45% involved
staff-on-youth sexual victimization.

* Upon investigation, 25% of the allegations of
youth-on-youth sexual victimization and 10% of the
allegations of staff-on-youth sexual victimization were
substantiated during the 6-year period.

* Across state systems and in locally or privately operated
facilities, youth-on-youth sexual victimization accounted
for more than three-quarters (76%) of substantiated
incidents from 2007 to 2012.

* Force or threat of force was involved in nearly a quarter
(22%) of youth-on-youth substantiated incidents.

* Nearly two-thirds (64%) of perpetrators of staff sexual
misconduct and about a third (31%) of perpetrators of staff
sexual harassment were female.

* Among all substantiated incidents of staff sexual
misconduct from 2007 to 2012, 64% involved a sexual
relationship that “appeared to be willing.” These incidents
were considered an abuse of power, with an unknown
level of coercion, and were illegal.

* An estimated 13% of incidents of staff sexual misconduct
involved unwanted touching for sexual gratification,
9% involved pressure or abuse of power, and 6% involved
indecent exposure, invasion of privacy, or voyeurism.

During 2015, BJS completed data collection of allegations
and substantiated incidents that occurred during calendar
year 2014. All state systems, the Federal Bureau of Prisons
(BOP), U.S. military, and ICE facilities participated in the
survey. Four (out of 700) sampled local jails, two privately
operated jails, one Indian country jail, and 12 out of 550
sampled locally or privately operated juvenile facilities failed
to respond. Overall, the SSV achieved a 99% response rate.

Results from the SSV for adult prisons and jails are expected
to be released by yearend 2016.

The National Inmate Survey (NIS) gathers data on the
prevalence and incidence of sexual assault in adult prison
and local jail facilities, as reported by inmates. The inmates
use audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI)
technology with a laptop touchscreen and an audio feed
to maximize inmate confidentiality and minimize literacy
issues. The first NIS (NIS-1) was conducted in 2007; the
second (NIS-2), in 2008–09; and the third (NIS-3), in
2011–12.

The NIS-3 was conducted in 233 state and federal prisons,
358 local jails, and 15 special confinement facilities operated
by ICE, the U.S. military, and correctional authorities in
Indian country. A total of 92,449 inmates age 18 or older
participated in the survey, including 38,251 prison inmates,
52,926 jail inmates, 573 ICE detainees, 539 inmates in
military facilities, and 160 inmates in Indian country
facilities. The survey was also administered to 527 youth ages
16 to 17 held in state prisons and 1,211 youth ages 16 to 17
in local jails.

The first report from NIS-3 was issued in May 2013: Sexual
Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates,
2011–12 (NCJ 241399). During 2015, BJS issued three
reports using NIS-3 data: Veterans in Prison and Jail,
2011–12 (NCJ 249144), Disabilities Among Prison and Jail
Inmates, 2011–12 (NCJ 249151), and Use of Restrictive
Housing in U.S. Prisons and Jails, 2011–12 (NCJ 249209).
These reports addressed significant issues in corrections
that otherwise could not have been addressed without the
in-depth data collected under PREA. Additional reports
are projected for 2016, including reports on mental health
problems of prison and jail inmates and pre-incarceration
exposure to traumatic events among prison and jail inmates.

During 2015, BJS and the NIS-3 data collection agent,
RTI International, undertook a comprehensive assessment
of the NIS-3 survey protocol, sampling methodologies,
instrumentation, and analytical products. The
assessment includes--

* a critical assessment of the total survey operations,
including recommendations for achieving greater
efficiency and cost savings in the next round of data
collection

* an assessment of the NIS-3 sample design related to
facility-level estimation and development of an optimal
design to provide reliable facility-level estimates for
prison and jail facilities

* an item-specific assessment of the NIS-3 sexual assault
questionnaires, which identifies items with potential
measurement error, nonresponse, or other sources of
survey error

* an examination of the substantive gaps in the NIS-3
sexual assault questionnaires, with special emphasis on
the nature and circumstances surrounding staff sexual
misconduct and boundary violations, collusion among
inmates and staff surrounding victimization, impact
on victims, and other factors related to facility climate,
institutional culture, and correctional leadership

* an inventory of prospective items based on the contextual
analyses conducted for NIS-3, to be included in a
supplemental facility survey (including recommendation
of items needed to better measure facility characteristics
that may co-vary with sexual victimization).

In preparation for the next NIS survey, BJS convened
a national workshop in April 2016 to solicit views of
correctional administrators (as required under Section 4
of the Prison Rape Elimination Act) and to ensure that the
survey will maximize data quality and minimize burden
on sampled facilities. In 2017, BJS expects to issue a
competitive solicitation to obtain a collection agent through
a cooperative agreement to administer the fourth National
Inmate Survey (NIS-4), 2018–19.

The National Survey of Youth in Custody (NSYC)
provides facility-level estimates of youth reporting sexual
victimization in juvenile facilities. The first NSYC (NSYC-1)
was conducted between June 2008 and April 2009, and the
second (NSYC-2) was conducted between February 2012
and September 2012.

The NSYC-2 was conducted in 273 state-owned or -operated
juvenile facilities and 53 locally or privately operated
facilities that held adjudicated youth under state contract.
The survey was completed by 8,707 adjudicated youth
sampled from at least one facility in every state and the
District of Columbia.

BJS released the first report from NSYC-2 in June 2013:
Sexual Victimization in Juvenile Facilities Reported by Youth,
2012 (NCJ 241708). During 2015, BJS and the NSYC data
collection agent, Westat, conducted further analyses of the
NSYC-2 data to identify the key contextual and individual
factors related to youth sexual victimization. Analyses of
the NSYC-2 Facility Survey examine the impact of facility
and staff sizes, staff and youth composition, staff screening
methods, and security measures. Additional measures of
facility-level characteristics were derived from the youth
self-reports. These measures include facility assault rates,
fear of assault in the facility, attitudes of youth toward staff,
gang activity in the facility, and the nature and extent of
inappropriate staff behavior with youth.

During 2015, BJS and Westat assessed the NSYC-2 sample
design, survey operations, collection protocols, and
questionnaires. In April 2016, BJS convened a national
workshop of administrators of juvenile correctional facilities
and other stakeholders to solicit their views on potential
revisions for the next round of data collection. BJS also
issued a competitive solicitation to obtain a collection agent
through a cooperative agreement to administer the third
National Survey of Youth in Custody (NSYC-3), 2017–18.
Survey design and testing is expected to be completed
by March 2017. Data collection is anticipated to begin in
late 2017.

In 2016, BJS released Facility-level and Individual-level
Correlates of Sexual Victimization in Juvenile Facilities,
2012 (June 2016). This report examines National Survey
of Youth in Custody (NSYC-2) data to determine how the
environment of a juvenile facility impacts youth sexual
victimization. The report also considers critical youth-level
predictors. Overall, facilities with higher rates of sexual
assault house more youth who have submitted written
complaints against staff, do not have enough staff to monitor
what takes place in the facility, and have higher levels of
gang fights. However, the results indicate that a juvenile’s
individual characteristics--including their victimization
history, sexual orientation, gender, and offense history--are
more important than facility factors in predicting sexual
victimization.

Among the findings--

* Rates of youth-on-youth sexual victimization in female-only
facilities (5.3%) were more than three times greater
than those in male-only facilities (1.5%).

* Youth-on-youth sexual assault was lowest in facilities
(1.1%) when almost all youth in the facility reported that
they first learned sexual assault was not allowed within
the first 24 hours of arrival.

* Youth-on-youth sexual assault (4.5%) was most prevalent
when facilities had a high concentration of youth
with histories of sexual abuse (24% or more youth), a
concentration of youth with a lesbian, gay or bisexual
(LGB) sexual orientation (5.0% in facilities with 18%
or LGB youth) and greater-than-average proportion of
youth held for a violent sexual assault (3.3%).

* Sexual assault by another youth (4.0%) was more
common in facilities that held greater concentrations
of youth with a history of psychiatric conditions (76%
or more).

* LGB youth (10.4%) were more than seven times as likely
as heterosexual youth (1.4%) to be assaulted by another
youth.

* Youth with a detention history of 6 months or more
(9.3%) and youth who had been in the current facility for
6 months or more (9.4%) were most likely to experience
staff sexual assault.

* In facilities with only male residents, 5.7% of youth
reported staff sexual misconduct, compared to 1.4% in
facilities with only female residents.

* Staff sexual misconduct was most prevalent in detention
centers (7.4%) and training/long-term secure facilities
(7.3%).

* Facilities with a change in staffing levels over the past
12 months had higher rates of staff sexual misconduct
(6.1%) than facilities with no change (3.1%).

* Rates of staff sexual misconduct are highest in facilities
in which youth perceive the facility to be unfair (10.3%),
in facilities with the fewest positive perceptions of staff
(9.7%), and where youth worry about physical assault by
other youth (8.2%) or by staff (11.2%).

* In facilities where the majority of youth reported gang
fights, the rate of staff sexual misconduct was more than
double (10.6%) the facility average (5.2%).
