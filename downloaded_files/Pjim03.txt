Highlights
                                     
Prison population increased by 40,983, the largest increase in 4
years

In the year ending June 30, 2003 --

*  The number of inmates in custody in local jails rose by 25,826; 
in State prison by 21,552; and in Federal prison by 10,492.

*  The smaller State prison systems had the greatest percentage 
increase: Vermont (up 12.2%), Minnesota (up 9.4%), and Maine (up 
9.1%). 

At midyear 2003 --

*  A total of 3,006 State prisoners were under age 18. Adult jails 
held a total of 6,869 persons under age 18.

*  State and Federal correctional authorities held 90,700 noncitizens, 
up from 88,677 (2.3%) at midyear 2003.

*  There were 119 female inmates per 100,000 women in the United 
States, compared to 1,331 male inmates per 100,000 men.

*  An estimated 12% of black males, 3.7% of Hispanic males, and 1.6% 
of white males in their twenties were in prison or jail.

*  Local jails were operating 6% below their rated capacity. In 
contrast, at yearend 2002 State prisons were operating between 1% 
and 17% above capacity, and Federal prisons were 33% above their 
rated capacity.

*  Privately operated prison facilities held 94,361 inmates (up 
1.3% since yearend 2002). The Federal system  reported the
largest increase among inmates in private prisons (up 1,181).
-------------------------------------------

At midyear 2003 the Nation's prisons and jails incarcerated 
2,078,570 persons. Prisoners in the custody of the 50 States and 
the Federal Government accounted for two-thirds of the incarcerated 
population (1,380,776 inmates). The other third were held in local 
jails (691,301).

On June 30, 2003, 1,460,920 prisoners were under Federal and State
jurisdiction, which includes inmates in custody and persons under 
the legal authority of a prison system but held outside its 
facilities. During the 12-month period ending June 30, 2003, the
number under State jurisdiction rose by 2.6%, while the number under 
Federal jurisdiction rose by 5.4%. Vermont (up 12.2%), Minnesota 
(up 9.4%), Maine (up 9.1%), and Mississippi (up 6.5%) had the 
largest percentage increases. Nine States had decreases, including 
Rhode Island (-3.4%), Arkansas (-2.2%), and Montana (-2.1%). 

At midyear 2003 local jail authorities held or supervised 762,672 
offenders. Ten percent of these offenders (71,371)were supervised 
outside jail facilities in programs such as community service,
work release, weekend reporting, electronic monitoring, and other
alternative programs. 

Incarceration rate for Nation reaches 715 per 100,000 residents 

On June 30, 2003, 1,380,776 inmates were in the custody of State and 
Federal prison authorities, and 691,301 inmates were in the custody 
of local jail authorities. In the first 6 months of 2003, the Nation's 
prison population increased 19,518 (1.4%). These data were collected 
in the 2003 National Prisoner Statistics program and the 2003 Annual
Survey of Jails. (See Methodology, page 11, for a description of data
collections.) 

Since midyear 2002 the total incarcerated population has increased 
2.9%. Including inmates in public and privately operated facilities, 
the number of inmates in State prisons increased 1.8%; in Federal 
prisons, 7.1%; and in local jails, 3.9%. At midyear 2003, Federal 
prisons (including all secure and non-secure public and private 
facilities)    held 8.0% of all inmates, up from 5.6% in 1995. 

Between yearend 1995 and midyear 2003, the incarcerated population 
grew an average of 3.7% annually. 

During this period the Federal and State prison populations and the 
local jail population grew at the average annual rates of 8.0%,2.9%, 
and 4.0%, respectively.

In the 12 months before midyear 2003,the number of inmates in prison 
and jail rose an estimated 57,601 inmates, or 1,108 inmates per week. 

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail in 2003 was 715 inmates 
per 100,000 U.S. residents -0- up from 703 at midyear 2002. At midyear 
2003, 1 in every 140 U.S. residents were in prison or jail.

State prison population largest increase since 1999

The rate of growth of the State prison population slowed between 
1995 and 2001 and then began to rise. During this time, the 
percentage change in the first 6 months of each year steadily
decreased, reaching a low of 0.6% in 2001, and then rose to 1.3% 
in 2003. The percentage change in the second 6 months of each year 
showed a similar trend, resulting in an actual decrease in State 
prison populations for the second half of 2000 and 2001.  

Since 1995 the Federal system has grown at a much higher rate than 
the States, peaking at 6% growth in the first 6 months of 1999. In 
the first 6 months of 2003, the number of Federal inmates increased 
4.2% (nearly 3 times the rate of State growth). 

Some of the Federal growth since 1999 has been the result of the 
transfer of responsibility for housing sentenced felons from the 
District of Columbia. The transfer to Federal facilities was
completed by yearend 2001. Since then, the Federal system has 
continued to receive sentenced felons from DC Superior Court. 

In absolute numbers, the total increase of 40,983 State and 
Federal prison inmates between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2003, 
was significantly higher than the growth during the previous 12-
month period (20,587 inmates).

The 2.9% growth represents the largest growth in the prison 
population since the 12-month period ending June 30, 1999.
However, it remains lower than the average annual growth of 
3.2% from 1995 to 2003. 

Federal system accounts for over 20% of inmate population increase

Over a fifth of the growth (23%) in the Nation's prison population 
during the 12 months ending June 30, 2003, was accounted for by 
the 8,780 additional inmates under jurisdiction of the Federal
system. During this 12-month period, several States also 
experienced substantial growth, including Vermont (12.2%), 
Minnesota (9.4%), Maine (9.1%), and Mississippi (6.5%).

Nine States experienced a decline in their prison population. Rhode 
Island had the largest percentage decrease (-3.4%), followed by 
Arkansas (-2.2%), Montana (-2.1%), and New York (-1.8%). 

----------------------------------------
Prison incarceration rates continue to rise

The incarceration rate of State and Federal prisoners sentenced to 
more than 1 year was 480 per 100,000 U.S. residents on June 30, 
2003, up from 476 per 100,000 on December 31, 2002. At midyear 2003, 
12 States led by Louisiana (803 sentenced prisoners per 100,000 
State residents), Texas (692), and Mississippi (688), exceeded the
national rate. Nine States, including Maine (148), Minnesota (150), 
and North Dakota (175) -- had rates that were less than half of the 
national rate.

Overall, the State incarceration rate rose about 14% between yearend 
1995 and midyear 2003, from 379 to 429 prisoners per 100,000 U.S. 
residents. At the same time, the Federal incarceration rate rose
almost 60%, from 32 to 51 prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents.

Since yearend 1995 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000
residents has risen from 411 to 480. During this period prison 
incarceration rates rose the most in the Midwest (from 310 to 
377), followed by the South (from 483 to 541) and the West 
(from 358 to 416). The rate in the Northeast rose slightly from 
301 to 304. 

Half of inmates in private facilities held for Federal system 
and three States  

In the first 6 months of 2003, the number of prisoners held in 
privately operated facilities increased from 93,179 to 94,361, 
an increase of 1.3%.  Overall, private facilities held 6.5% of 
all State and Federal inmates, up from 6.2% at midyear 2002. 

The Federal system (21,372), Texas (16,714), Oklahoma (5,573), 
and Tennessee (5,079) reported the largest number of inmates in 
private facilities at midyear 2003. Four States -- New Mexico 
(44%), Alaska (29%), Wyoming, and Montana (both 26%) -- had at 
least a quarter of their prisoners in private facilities.
-------------------------------------------

Female inmate population rose at a
faster rate than male inmate
population in last 12-month period  

From July 1, 2002, to June 30, 2003, the number of women under 
the jurisdiction of State and Federal prison authorities grew 
from 95,363 to 100,102, an increase of 5.0%. The number of men
rose 2.7%, from 1,324,574 to 1,360,818. At midyear 2003, 
California, Texas, Florida, and the Federal system housed 4 of 
every 10 female inmates.

Since 1995 the annual rate of growth in the number of female 
inmates has averaged 5.2%, higher than the 3.4% average increase 
of male inmates.  Women accounted for 6.9% of all inmates at 
midyear 2003, up from 6.1% at yearend 1995.

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident population, men 
were about 15 times more likely than women to be incarcerated 
in a State or Federal prison. On June 30, 2003, the rate for 
inmates serving a sentence of more than 1 year was 61 female 
inmates per 100,000 women in the United States, compared to 
914 sentenced male inmates per 100,000 men.

Number of State inmates under age
18 continues to decline

A total of 3,006 State prisoners were under age 18 on June 30, 
2003, down slightly from 3,038 at midyear 2002. Overall, 0.2% 
of all State prisoners were under age 18.

Ten States reported more than 100 prisoners under age 18 at 
midyear 2003, led by Texas (487), Connecticut (300), Florida 
(298), New York (231), and North Carolina (178). Three of these 
States reported an increase in their under age 18 populations 
held in prison during the 12 months ending June 30, 2003.

Three States (Maine, Kentucky, and West Virginia)had no inmates 
under age 18 at midyear 2003. Fourteen other States reported 
fewer than 10 inmates under age 18.

At midyear 2003, 62% of noncitizen
prisoners held in State facilities; 
38% in Federal facilities 

On June 30, 2003, 90,700 noncitizens were in the custody of State 
or Federal correctional authorities, up from 88,677 at midyear 
2002. Overall, 6.6% of State and Federal inmates at midyear 2003
were not U.S. citizens. The noncitizen prisoner population 
increased between 1998 and 1999, and since then has remained 
nearly stable, changing about 2% between midyear 1999 and 
midyear 2003. 

At midyear 2003, 34,456 Federal inmates were noncitizens, 
representing over 20% of all prisoners in Federal custody. 
California (18,559), Texas (8,702), New York (8,370), Florida
(4,739), and Arizona (3,670) held almost 80% of all noncitizens 
confined in State prison. Noncitizen prisoners accounted
for over 10% of the prison populations of California, New York, 
Arizona, and Nevada.

Growth continues as rising admissions outpace releases

From 2000 to 2002 admissions to State prison rose 5.8% (from 
581,487 in 2000 to 615,377 in 2002). During 2002, 589,844 
sentenced prisoners were released from State prisons, up from
569,599 in 2000 -- an increase of 3.6%.

Admissions to the Federal prison system increased 10.1% between 
2000 and 2002 (from 43,732 to 48,144); releases increased 20.1% 
(35,259 to 42,339).  Although releases rose faster than admissions, 
the number of admissions to Federal prison in 2002 exceeded
releases by more than 5,800 inmates.

Overall, State prison release rates dropped from 37 per 100 inmates 
in 1990 to 31 per 100 in 1995 and then remained nearly unchanged 
(reaching 32 per 100 in 2002). However, as a result of increasing 
total prison populations, the absolute number of releases increased 
30% (from 455,139 in 1995 to 589,844 in 2002).

Number of parole violators returned to prison stable since 1998

Prior to 1998 growth in prison admissions reflected increasing
numbers of offenders returning for parole violations. Between 
1990 and 1998, the number of returned parole violators increased 
54% (from 133,870 to 206,152), while the number of new court 
commitments increased 7% (from 323,069 to 347,270). However, since
1998 parole violators returned to prison increased less than 1%, 
while new court commitments rose 13%. 

At midyear the Nation's jails supervised 762,672 persons

As defined in this report, jails are locally operated correctional 
facilities that confine persons before or after adjudication. Inmates
sentenced to jail usually have a sentence of 1 year or less, but 
jails also incarcerate persons in a wide variety of other categories.
(See box below.) 

Based on the 2003 Annual Survey of Jails, the Nation's local jails 
held or supervised 762,672 offenders on June 30, 2003. Jail 
authorities supervised 9% of these offenders (71,371) in 
alternative programs outside the jail facilities. A
total of 691,301 persons were housed in local jails.

---------------------------
Jails --

*  receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them awaiting
trial, conviction, or sentencing

*  readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and 
absconders

*  temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to juvenile 
authorities

*  hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to appropriate 
health facilities

*  hold individuals for the military, for protective custody, for 
contempt, and for the courts as witnesses

*  release convicted inmates to the community upon completion of 
sentence

*  transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other authorities

*  house inmates for Federal, State, or other authorities because 
of crowding of their facilities

*  sometimes operate community- based programs as alternatives to
incarceration

*  hold inmates sentenced to short terms (generally under 1 year).
----------------------------------------

Among persons under community supervision by jail staff in 2003, 
24% were required to perform community service (17,102) and 17% 
participated in a weekend reporting program (12,111). Eighteen 
percent of offenders in the community were under electronic
monitoring; 16% were under other pretrial supervision; 3% were in 
a drug, alcohol, mental health, or other type of medical treatment 
program; and 6% were in a work release or other alternative work 
program.

Number of jail inmates rose 25,800 in
12 months ending June 30, 2003 

Between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2003, the number of persons held 
in local jail facilities grew 3.9% -- from 665,475 to 691,301. The 
12-month increase was similar to the average annual growth (4.0%) 
from midyear 1995 to midyear 2003. The 3.9% growth in 2003 was less 
than last year's increase of 5.4%. In absolute numbers, the total 
increase of 25,826 inmates in 2003 was 8,400 less than the increase 
in 2002(34,235).

Jail incarceration rates rose in last 12-month period

Since 1995 the Nation's jail population on a per capita basis has 
increased over 23%. During this period the number of jail inmates 
per 100,000 residents rose from 193 to 238. 

When individuals under community supervision by jail authorities 
are included with those in custody, the rate was 262 persons per 
100,000 U.S. residents at midyear 2003. 

An estimated total of 6,869 persons under age 18 were housed in 
adult jails on June 30, 2003. Eighty percent of these young 
inmates had been convicted or were being held for trial as adults 
in criminal court. The average daily population for the year 
ending June 30, 2003, was 680,760, an increase of 4.4% from 2002 
and 33.5% from 1995.

Characteristics of jail inmate population changing gradually

Male inmates made up 88.1% of the local jail inmate population 
at midyear 2003 -- 1.7 percentage points lower than at midyear 
1995.  During the 12-month period ending June 30, 2003, the
number of adult female inmates rose 6.3%, while the number of 
adult male inmates increased 3.7%. On average the adult female 
jail population has grown 6.4% annually in the past 10 years, 
while the adult male inmate population has grown 3.9%. 

At midyear 2003 nearly 6 in 10 persons in local jails were racial 
or ethnic minorities. Whites made up 43.6% of the jail population; 
blacks, 39.2%; Hispanics, 15.4%; and other races (Asians,
American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and other 
Pacific Islanders), 1.8%.

On a per capita basis, men were nearly 8 times more likely than 
women to have been held in a local jail on June 30, 2003. Blacks 
were 5 times more likely than whites, nearly 3 times more likely
than Hispanics, and over 9 times more likely than persons of 
other races to have been in jail.

On June 30, 2003, 60% of the Nation's adult jail inmates were 
awaiting court action on their current charge. An estimated 
270,000 adults held in local jails were serving a sentence in 
jail, awaiting sentencing, or serving time for a probation or 
parole violation. As a percent of all jail inmates, the percent
convicted has dropped from 44.0% at midyear 2000 to 39.4% at 
midyear 2003.

At midyear 2003, 94% of jail capacity occupied

In the 12 months ending June 30, 2003, fewer beds than inmates were 
added to the Nation's jails. At midyear 2003 the rated capacity of 
local jails was estimated at 736,471 beds, an increase of 22,572 
in 12 months. 

Rated capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates allocated 
by State or local rating officials to each jail facility. The 
growth in jail capacity during the 12-month period ending on June 
30, 2003, (22,572) was less than the average growth of 23,839 beds 
every 12 months since midyear 1995, but was more than the growth 
in the number of beds during 2001 (21,522) and 2002 (14,590). 

As of June 30, 2003, 94% of the local jail capacity was occupied.
**Footnote: On December 31, 2002, State prisons were operating 
between 1% and 17% above capacity, while Federal prisons were
operating at 33% above capacity.  See Prisoners in 2002, July 
2003, NCJ 200248.**  As a ratio of all inmates housed in jail 
facilities to total capacity, the percentage occupied decreased 
by 10 percentage points from 1990 to 2003. At midyear 1990 local 
jails operated at 4% above their rated capacity.

Jail jurisdictions that on average held between 500-999 inmates 
again reported the highest occupancy rates. At midyear 2003 
occupancy was 96% of rated capacity in jail jurisdictions with 
an average daily population of 1,000 or more inmates, compared 
to 67% in those with fewer than 50 inmates.

The 50 largest jail jurisdictions
housed a third of all jail inmates 

On June 30, 2003, the Nation's 50 largest jail jurisdictions held 
31.2% (215,729) of all jail inmates. Twenty States had at least 
one jurisdiction which ranked in the top 50 for average daily
population. States with more than one jurisdiction among the 50 
largest jail jurisdictions are California (12), Florida (8),Texas 
(7), Georgia (3), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (2), and Tennessee (2).

The two jurisdictions with the most inmates, Los Angeles County 
and New York City, together held approximately 33,700 inmates, 
or 5% of the national total. 

Seventeen jurisdictions among the 50 largest experienced a decrease 
in the number of inmates held between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 
2003. Jurisdictions with double-digit decreases were Contra Costa 
County, California (down 15.7%), Travis County, Texas (down 15.5%), 
and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin (down 12.9%).

Excluding the District of Columbia, 11 jail jurisdictions of the 
50 largest experienced double-digit growth. The jurisdiction with 
the largest increase in jail population was Fresno County,
California (up 43.1%). Other jail jurisdictions with substantial 
population increases were Polk County, Florida (up 33.3%), Fulton 
County, Georgia (up 22.7%), Hillsborough County, Florida (up 19.1%), 
De Kalb County, Georgia (up 14.9%), and Tarrant County, Texas,
along with Cobb County, Georgia (both up 14.4%). 
 
Nineteen of the 50 largest jail jurisdictions operated over their 
rated capacities. On June 30, 2003, Maricopa County, Arizona, operated at 158% of their capacity; Polk County, Florida, operated at 135%; 
and Philadelphia City, Pennsylvania, operated at 128% of capacity.

An estimated 12% of black males in their 
twenties in prison or jail in 2003

When total incarceration rates are estimated separately by age group,
black males in their twenties and thirties are found to have high 
rates relative to other groups. Among the more than 2 million 
offenders incarcerated on June 30, 2003, an estimated 577,300 were
black males between ages 20 and 39.

Among males age 25 to 29, 12.8% of blacks were in prison or jail, 
compared to 3.7% of Hispanics and about 1.6% of whites. 

Although incarceration rates drop with age, the percentage of black 
males age 45 to 54 in prison or jail in 2003 was an estimated 
4.4% -- more than  twice the highest rate (1.6%) among white males
(age 20 to 24).

Female incarceration rates, though significantly lower than male 
rates at every age, reveal similar racial and ethnic differences. 
Black females (with a prison and jail rate of 352 per 100,000)
were nearly 2½ times more likely than Hispanic females (148 per 
100,000) and over 4½ times more likely than white females (75 per 
100,000) to be incarcerated in 2003. These differences among white, 
black, and Hispanic females were consistent across all age groups.

Among black females, the rate was highest (891 per 100,000) among 
those age 30 to 34. This rate was more than 4 times higher than the 
rate among white females in this age group (211 per 100,000).

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics (NPS)

The Bureau of Justice Statistics, with the U.S. Census Bureau as 
its collection agent, obtains yearend and midyear counts of 
prisoners from departments of correction in each of the 50 States 
and the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  

NPS distinguishes between prisoners in custody from those under 
jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a State must hold 
that person in one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction, a 
State has legal authority over the prisoner. Prisoners under a 
State's jurisdiction may be in the custody of a local jail,
another State's prison, or other correctional facility such as 
a privately operated institution. Some States are unable to 
provide both custody and jurisdiction counts.  

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in locally administered
confinement facilities who are under the jurisdiction of local 
authorities. NPS counts include all inmates in State-operated 
facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, 
and Vermont, which have combined jail-prison systems. (See National 
Prisoner Statistics jurisdiction notes, on the BJS Web site.)

Annual Survey of Jails, 2003

In each of the years between the full censuses, a sample survey of 
jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the 
Nation's jails and the inmates housed in these jails. Based on 
information from the 1999 Census of Jails, a sample of jail 
jurisdictions was selected for the 2003 survey. A jurisdiction is 
a county (parish in Louisiana) or municipal government that
administers one or more local jails. The sample included all jail 
facilities (940) in 878 jurisdictions.

In drawing the sample, all multi-jurisdictional (55) jails were
included in the sample with certainty. These jails are operated 
jointly by two or more jurisdictions.  Other jurisdictions (356) 
were included automatically in the sample if their jails held 
juvenile inmates on census day and had an average daily population 
of 250 or more inmates, or if their jails held only adults and had 
an average daily population of 500 or more.


The remaining jurisdictions were stratified into two groups: 
jurisdictions with jails holding at least one juvenile on
June 30, 1999, and jurisdictions with jails holding adults only. 
Using stratified probability sampling, 467 jurisdictions were then 
selected from 10 strata based on the average daily population in 
the 1999 census.

Data were obtained by mailed and web-based survey questionnaires. 
After follow-up phone calls to respondents, the response rate for 
the survey was 100% for critical items such as rated capacity, 
average daily population, and number of inmates   confined. (For 
standard errors, see Appendix tables, Annual Survey of Jails
2003, on the BJS Web site.)
