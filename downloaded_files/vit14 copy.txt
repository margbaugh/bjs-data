Bulletin

Victims of Identity Theft, 2014
 
Erika Harrell, Ph.D., BJS Statistician

An estimated 17.6 million persons, or 7% of all U.S. residents 
age 16 or older, were victims of one or more incidents of 
identity theft in 2014 (figure 1). This was similar to findings 
in 2012. Among identity theft victims, existing bank (38%) or 
credit card (42%) accounts were the most common types of misused 
information.

During 2014, 3% of persons experienced at least one incident of 
the misuse of an existing credit card account. Also, 3% 
experienced the misuse of an existing bank account. Less than 1% 
experienced the misuse of an existing account (other than a bank 
or credit card account) or the misuse of personal information to 
open a new account or for other fraudulent purposes. 

This report uses data from the 2014 Identity Theft Supplement 
(ITS) to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). From 
January to June 2014, the ITS collected data from persons who 
experienced one or more attempted or successful incidents of 
identity theft during the 12 months preceding their interview.

************************************************

**************
Highlights
**************

* About 7% of persons age 16 or older were victims of identity 
theft in 2014, similar to findings in 2012.

* The majority of identity theft victims (86%) experienced the 
fraudulent use of existing account information, such as credit 
card or bank account information.

* The number of elderly victims of identity theft increased from 
2.1 million in 2012 to 2.6 million in 2014.
* About 14% of identity theft victims experienced out-of-pocket 
losses of $1 or more. Of these victims, about half suffered 
losses of less than $100.

* Half of identity theft victims who were able to resolve any 
associated problems did so in a day or less. 

* Among victims who experienced multiple types of identity theft 
with existing accounts and other fraud, about a third (32%) spent 
a month or more resolving problems.

* An estimated 36% of identity theft victims reported moderate or 
severe emotional distress as a result of the incident.
************************************************

Identity theft victims are defined as persons age 16 or older who 
experienced one or more of the following incidents:

** unauthorized use or attempted use of an existing account, such 
as a credit or debit card; or a checking, savings, telephone, 
online, or insurance account (referred to as fraud or misuse of 
an existing account)

** unauthorized use or attempted use of personal information to 
open a new account, such as a credit or debit card; or a 
telephone, checking, savings, loan, or mortgage account (referred 
to as fraud or misuse of a new account)

** misuse of personal information for a fraudulent purpose, such 
as getting medical care, a job, or government benefits; renting 
an apartment or house; or providing false information to law 
enforcement when charged with a crime or traffic violation 
(referred to as fraud or misuse of personal information).

This report details the number, percentage, and demographic 
characteristics of victims who reported one or more incidents of 
identity theft during a 12-month period. It focuses on the most 
recent incident to describe victim characteristics and victim 
responses to identity theft. It describes how the victim 
discovered the crime; financial losses and other consequences of 
identity theft, including the amount of time victims spent 
resolving associated problems; reporting the incident to credit 
card companies, credit bureaus, and law enforcement agencies; and 
the level of distress identity theft victims experienced. In 
addition, comparisons to estimates found in the 2012 ITS are 
made.

*******************************************
For 86% of identity theft victims, the most 
recent incident involved the unauthorized 
use of an existing account
*******************************************

In 2014, the most common type of identity theft was the 
unauthorized misuse or attempted misuse of an existing account. 
There were 16.4 million victims age 16 or older of this type of 
identity theft, which was similar to findings in 2012 (15.3 
million persons) (table 1). About 8.6 million victims experienced 
the fraudulent use of their credit cards, a slight increase from 
7.7 million victims in 2012. Another 1.5 million victims 
experienced other types of existing account theft, such as misuse 
or attempted misuse of an existing telephone, online, or 
insurance account.

An estimated 1.1 million victims reported the fraudulent misuse 
of their information to open a new account, such as a credit card 
or loan. Another 713,000 victims reported the misuse of their 
personal information for other fraudulent purposes, including 
getting medical care, employment, or other benefits.

In 2014, about 79% of victims experienced a single incident of 
identity theft, while 21% experienced multiple incidents (not 
shown)***Footnote 1 Less than 1% of victims did not know whether 
they experienced one or more than one incident***. During the 
single or most recent identity theft incident experienced in 
2014, 7% (1.3 million) of victims experienced multiple types of 
identity theft. Of these, the majority (921,500 persons) 
experienced the misuse of multiple types of existing accounts, 
such as credit card, checking, savings, telephone, or online 
accounts. The remaining 376,200 (2% of victims) who experienced 
multiple types of identity theft during a single incident 
reported some combination of misuse of an existing account, 
misuse of personal information to open a new account, and 
personal information used for other fraudulent purposes.

*******************************************
The number of elderly identity theft 
victims increased from 2012 to 2014
*******************************************

In 2014, more females (9.2 million) experienced identity theft 
than males (8.3 million) (table 2). No statistically significant 
change was observed in the 2012 and 2014 numbers of male and 
female identity theft victims. Males and females had similar 
prevalence rates in 2014 (about 7% each). For both males and 
females, the 2012 and 2014 prevalence rates remained unchanged.

The number of identity theft victims in each racial group 
measured did not change significantly from 2012 to 2014. A 
greater percentage of white non-Hispanics (8%) experienced 
identity theft in 2014 than black non-Hispanics (5%), non-
Hispanics of other races (6%), and Hispanics (5%). The prevalence 
rate of identity theft victims among whites increased slightly 
from 7% in 2012 to 8% in 2014. No statistically significant 
difference was found in the 2012 and 2014 prevalence rates for 
blacks, Hispanics, persons of other races, and persons of two or 
more races.

More persons age 65 or older were identity theft victims in 2014 
(2.6 million) than in 2012 (2.1 million). The number of identity 
theft victims in all other age groups measured did not 
significantly change from 2012 to 2014. Persons ages 25 to 64 
(8%) had higher prevalence rates of identity theft than persons 
age 18 to 24 (4%) and 65 or older (6%). From 2012 to 2014, the 
prevalence rates for each age group measured did not change.

In each income group measured, the number of identity theft 
victims did not significantly change from 2012 to 2014. In 2014, 
persons in the highest income category (those with an annual 
household income of $75,000 or more) had a higher prevalence of 
identity theft (11%) than persons in other income brackets. For 
all of the income groups measured, the 2012 and 2014 prevalence 
rates remained unchanged.

*******************************************
Persons in households with higher annual 
incomes were more likely to experience 
credit card misuse than persons in lower 
income households
*******************************************

In 2014, a similar percentage of males and females (about 3% 
each) experienced existing credit card fraud, even when 
accounting for persons who owned a credit card (5% each) (table 
3). No difference was observed by sex in the prevalence of the 
fraudulent use of personal information to open a new account, but 
the misuse of an existing bank account was more prevalent among 
females than males. This remained true when accounting for 
whether a person had a bank account.

After accounting for credit card ownership, persons ages 16 to 24 
were the least likely to experience existing credit card fraud, 
while persons age 65 or older had a similar prevalence rate as 
persons ages 25 to 49 (5%). Among those who had a bank account, 
persons ages 16 to 17 were the least likely to experience bank 
account fraud.

Among persons who had a credit card, whites (6%) had a higher 
prevalence of existing credit card fraud than blacks (3%) and 
Hispanics (3%). However, among persons who had a bank account, no 
significant differences were found in the prevalence of bank 
account misuse among whites, blacks, and Hispanics.

After accounting for credit card ownership, persons in the 
highest income bracket had the highest rate of existing credit 
card account misuse (8%). Among persons who had a bank account, 
persons in the highest income bracket had a higher prevalence of 
bank fraud (4%) than persons in households with incomes of 
$49,999 or less.

*******************************************
The most common way victims discovered 
identity theft was by being contacted 
by a financial institution
*******************************************

The way victims discovered that their identifying information was 
misused varied by the type of identity theft. Forty-five percent 
of of identity theft victims discovered the incident when a 
financial institution contacted them about suspicious activity 
(45%) or when they noticed fraudulent charges on an account (18%) 
(table 4). Among victims who experienced the unauthorized use of 
an existing account, 48% discovered the incident when a financial 
institution contacted them about suspicious activity on their 
account. In comparison, 15% of victims who experienced the misuse 
of personal information to open a new account or for other 
fraudulent purposes discovered the incident when a financial 
institution contacted them. Victims of these types of identity 
theft were most likely to discover the incident when another type 
of company or agency contacted them (21%); when they had problems 
with loans, government benefits, or taxes (16%); or after they 
received an unpaid bill (14%).

*******************************************
Most identity theft victims did not know 
how the offender obtained their information
*******************************************

About 32% of identity theft victims knew how the offender 
obtained their personal information (figure 2). Victims who 
experienced multiple types of identity theft during a single 
incident (42%) were more likely to know how the offender obtained 
their personal information than victims of existing credit card 
fraud (26%), other existing account fraud (31%), and new account 
fraud (33%). Of the 5.7 million victims who knew how the identity 
theft occurred, the most common way offenders obtained 
information (26%) was to steal it during a purchase or other 
transaction (not shown).

*******************************************
9 in 10 identity theft victims did not 
know anything about the offender
*******************************************

Overall, most identity theft victims (92%) in 2014 did not know 
anything about the identity of the offender (table 5). The 
percentage of victims who knew something about the offender 
varied depending on the type of identity theft. Victims of 
multiple types of identity theft in a single incident (17%) were 
more likely than victims of existing account misuse (6%) to know 
something about the offender. About 20% of new account victims 
and victims of personal information theft knew something about 
the offender. Across all types of identity theft, victims who 
experienced the misuse of an existing credit card (4%) were the 
least likely to know something about the offender.

*******************************************
About two-thirds of identity theft victims 
reported a direct financial loss
*******************************************

The economic impact of identity theft is made up of direct and 
indirect financial loss. Direct financial loss, the majority of 
the total loss associated with identity theft, refers to the 
monetary amount the offender obtained from misusing the victim’s 
account or personal information, including the estimated value of 
goods, services, or cash obtained. Indirect loss includes any 
other costs caused by the identity theft, such as legal fees, 
bounced checks, and other miscellaneous expenses (e.g., postage, 
phone calls, or notary fees). Direct and indirect losses do not 
necessarily reflect personal losses to victims, as victims may be 
reimbursed for some or all of the direct and indirect losses.

In 2014, 65% of identity theft victims reported a combined direct 
and indirect financial loss associated with the most recent 
incident, similar to findings in 2012 (table 6). Overall, in 2012 
and 2014, victims who experienced a direct and indirect financial 
loss of at least $1 lost an average of $1,343, with a median loss 
of $300.

The amount of financial loss varied by the type of identity 
theft. Approximately 66% of credit card fraud victims, 69% of 
bank fraud, 41% of new account fraud, and 35% of personal 
information fraud victims experienced a financial loss. Of 
victims who experienced multiple types of identity theft, 76% 
reported a financial loss (see appendix table 1). 

In 2014, 64% of the 17.6 million victims of identity theft 
reported a direct financial loss as a result of the identity 
theft incident, similar to findings in 2012. About 65% of credit 
card fraud victims, 68% of bank fraud victims, 39% of new account 
fraud victims, and 29% of personal information fraud victims 
reported that the offender obtained money, goods, or services 
(see appendix table 1). Of those victims who experienced multiple 
types of identity theft, 74% reported a direct financial loss 
associated with the incident.

Among those who reported a direct financial loss, victims of 
personal information fraud lost an average of $7,761 or a median 
of $2,000 per victim, compared to victims of existing bank fraud 
who lost an average of $780 or a median of $200 per victim.

In addition to any direct financial loss, 5% of all identity 
theft victims reported indirect losses associated with the most 
recent incident of identity theft. Victims who suffered an 
indirect loss of at least $1 reported an average indirect loss of 
$261 with a median of $10.

*******************************************
In 2014, 14% of identity theft victims 
suffered an out-of-pocket financial loss
*******************************************

In some instances, a company (e.g., credit card or insurance 
company) may reimburse some or all of the financial loss, 
reducing or eliminating the out-of pocket losses for victims. At 
the time of the interview, 14% of victims of identity theft had 
experienced personal out-of-pocket financial losses of $1 or 
more. Of these victims who suffered an out-of-pocket financial 
loss, 49% had total losses of $99 or less (figure 3). About 16% 
of victims reported out-of-pocket expenses of $100 to $249. An 
additional 14% of identity theft victims reported out-of-pocket 
expenses of $1,000 or more. The prevalence and amount of out-of-
pocket loss varied by the type of identity theft. Victims 
experiencing the opening of a new account or the misuse of 
personal information had greater loss than those experiencing 
misuse of an existing credit card or bank account (see appendix 
table 1).

*******************************************
Annual total financial loss driven 
by a small percentage of victims
*******************************************

In 2012 and 2014, most of the total financial loss was attributed 
to victims in the highest percentile of loss (table 7). In 2012, 
victims up to the 90th percentile of the distribution of total 
financial loss reported a cumulative loss of $4.2 billion, 
compared to $4.3 billion in 2014. When considering the total 
cumulative loss, victims in 2012 lost $24.7 billion, compared to 
$15.4 billion in 2014. The large decline in the total loss can be 
attributed to differences in reported loss experienced by victims 
in the top 10%. In 2012, these victims lost $20.5 billion, 
compared to $11.1 billion in 2014.

As with total loss in 2012 and 2014, most of the total out-of-
pocket loss was attributed to the top 10% (table 8). In 2014, the 
90th percentile of the distribution of total out-of-pocket loss 
was $491 million, compared to $455 million in 2012. In 2014, the 
total cumulative out-of-pocket loss was $6.5 billion, compared to 
$10.7 billion in 2012.

*******************************************
Victims of identity theft who experienced 
existing account misuse were the least 
likely to have credit-related problems
*******************************************

In addition to suffering monetary losses, some identity theft 
victims experienced other financial and legal problems. They paid 
higher interest rates on credit cards, they were turned down for 
loans or other credit, their utilities were turned off, or they 
were the subject of criminal proceedings. Victims who experienced 
the misuse of an existing account were generally less likely to 
experience financial and legal problems as a result of the 
incident than victims who had other personal information misused 
(table 9). In 2014, 2% of identity theft victims experienced 
credit or banking problems as a result of the incident and about 
3% experienced problems with debt collectors. Two percent of 
victims of existing account misuse experienced problems with debt 
collectors and banking. About 13% of victims of other types of 
identity theft experienced credit problems and 14% percent 
reported problems with debt collectors.

*******************************************
1% of victims of existing account misuse 
reported problems at work or school, 
compared to 4% of victims of misuse of 
personal information
*******************************************

Victims of violent crime (including rape or sexual assault, 
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault) and identity 
theft were asked about the impact of the victimization on work, 
school, and personal relationships, and the amount of emotional 
distress it caused. Compared to violent crime victims, a lower 
percentage of identity theft victims reported significant 
problems at work or school and with family members or friends due 
to the incident (figure 4). About 1% of identity theft victims 
reported significant problems at work or school, compared to 14% 
of violent crime victims. Similarly, 3% of identity theft victims 
reported significant problems with family members or friends, 
compared to 21% of violent crime victims.

The percentage of identity theft victims who reported significant 
problems at work or school as a result of the incident varied by 
type of identity theft. About 4% of victims who had personal 
information used for fraudulent purposes other than to open a new 
account reported significant problems at work or school, compared 
to about 1% of victims of existing account misuse. About 12% of 
victims of multiple types of identity theft (other than existing 
account misuse) had significant problems with family or friend 
relationships, compared to 2% of victims of existing account 
misuse.

*******************************************
1 in 10 identity theft victims was severely 
distressed due to the crime, compared to 
1 in 3 violent crime victims
*******************************************

In 2014, 10% of identity theft victims reported that the crime 
was severely distressing, compared to 29% of violent crime 
victims (table 10). However, the level of emotional distress 
varied by type of identity theft. Twenty-one percent of victims 
of personal information fraud reported that they found the 
incident severely distressing, compared to 5% of existing credit 
card fraud victims. Thirty-six percent of victims of multiple 
types of identity theft with existing account and other fraud 
reported that the crime was severely distressing.

*******************************************
The majority of identity theft victims 
spent a day or less resolving associated 
financial and credit problems
*******************************************

At the time of the interview, 87% of identity theft victims had 
resolved any problems associated with the incident (see appendix 
table 16). Of these, most (52%) spent a day or less clearing up 
the problems, while about 9% spent more than a month. Victims of 
the misuse of existing accounts (54%) were more likely to resolve 
any associated financial and credit problems within a day, 
compared to victims of new account fraud (36%) and victims of 
multiple types of identity theft (39%) (figure 5). Among victims 
who had resolved all problems associated with the identity theft, 
16% with multiple types of identity theft spent more than a month 
clearing up the problems, compared to 8% of victims of existing 
account misuse.

Whether identity theft victims had resolved associated problems 
or not at the time of the interview, victims reported spending an 
average of about 7 hours clearing up the issues. Victims of 
existing credit card account misuse spent an average of 4 hours 
resolving problems, while victims who experienced multiple types 
of identity theft with existing accounts and other fraud spent an 
average of 24 hours resolving all problems (not shown).

*******************************************
The level of emotional distress victims 
experienced was related to the length of 
time they spent resolving problems
*******************************************

Victims who spent more time resolving the financial and credit-
related problems associated with the identity theft incident were 
more likely to experience problems with work and other 
relationships and severe emotional distress than victims who were 
able to resolve the problems relatively quickly. Among identity 
theft victims who spent 6 months or more resolving financial and 
credit problems due to the theft, 29% experienced severe 
emotional distress (figure 6). In comparison, 4% of victims who 
spent a day or less clearing up problems reported that the 
incident was severely distressing. Similarly, 12% of victims who 
spent 6 months or more resolving issues related to the identity 
theft reported having significant problems with family members or 
friends, compared to about 1% of victims who spent a day or less 
resolving problems.

*******************************************
Fewer than 1 in 10 identity theft victims 
reported the incident to police
*******************************************

In 2014, 8% of identity theft victims reported the incident to 
police or law enforcement agencies (figure 7). Victims of 
personal information fraud (35%) were the most likely to report 
the incident to police, followed by new account fraud victims 
(20%) and victims of multiple types of identity theft (17%). 
Fewer than 10% of victims of existing credit card (3%) and 
existing bank account (8%) fraud reported the incident to police.

The 92% of identity theft victims who did not report the incident 
to police offered a variety of reasons for not reporting (see 
appendix table 3). Among all victims who did not report the 
incident to police, the most common reason was that the victim 
handled the incident in another way (58%). Twenty-six percent of 
nonreporting victims did not contact police because they thought 
the incident was not important enough to be reported, and another 
21% did not know how to report the incident to police.

*******************************************
Of the 8% of identity theft victims who 
contacted a credit bureau, about 7 in 10 
placed a fraud alert on their credit report
*******************************************

In 2014, 89% of all victims of identity theft reported the 
incident to one or more nonlaw enforcement agencies, either 
government or commercial (not shown). About 87% of identity theft 
victims contacted a credit card company or bank to report misuse 
or attempted misuse of an account or personal information (see 
appendix table 5). 

Eight percent of identity theft victims contacted a credit bureau 
to report the incident. Victims whose identifying information was 
fraudulently used to open a new account (33%) were most likely to 
contact a credit bureau.

Victims of any type of identity theft who contacted a credit 
bureau could take several different actions. Sixty-eight percent 
of victims who contacted a credit bureau placed a fraud alert on 
their credit report, while 18% provided a police report to the 
credit bureau (figure 8).

*******************************************
About 85% of persons took some action to 
prevent identity theft victimization
*******************************************

Persons were asked about actions they took during the prior 12 
months to prevent identity theft, such as checking credit 
reports, shredding documents with personal information, and 
changing passwords on financial accounts. In 2014, 85% of persons 
engaged in one or more of the preventive actions asked about in 
the survey (table 11). A greater percentage of victims (97%) than 
nonvictims (84%) engaged in at least one preventive action. 
However, about 13% of victims who took preventive action did so 
in response to experiencing identity theft in the past year.

Overall, the two most common preventive actions in 2014 were 
checking bank or credit statements (76%) and shredding or 
destroying documents with personal information (69%). A higher 
percentage of victims than nonvictims engaged in both of these 
preventive actions. However, about 14% of victims began shredding 
or destroying documents with personal information as a result of 
experiencing identity theft during the prior 12 months, and 26% 
began checking bank or credit statements as a result of the 
victimization.

Less than 10% of victims purchased identity theft protection 
(4%), purchased identity theft insurance or used a credit 
monitoring service (6%), or used an identity theft security 
program on the computer (5%) after experiencing identity theft. 
Twenty-six percent of victims checked financial accounts and 28% 
changed passwords on these accounts as a result of the 
victimization.

Among persons who did not experience identity theft in 2014, 38% 
checked their credit report, 30% changed passwords on financial 
accounts, 13% used identity theft security programs on their 
computer, 5% purchased identity theft insurance or used a credit 
monitoring service, and 3% purchased identity theft protection.
************************************************

**************************************
15% of persons experienced identity 
theft at some point during their lives
**************************************

Resolving the problems caused by identity theft may take more 
than a year for some victims. Of the 22 million persons age 16 or 
older who experienced the misuse of existing accounts or other 
personal information prior to 2014, 7% were still resolving the 
problems associated with the identity theft more than a year 
later (table 12). A greater percentage of persons who experienced 
the misuse of personal information to open a new account (17%) or 
for other fraudulent purposes (14%) prior to 2014 had unresolved 
problems more than a year later, compared to persons who 
experienced existing account misuse (4%).

Overall, 15% of persons age 16 or older, or 36.5 million persons, 
experienced one or more incidents of identity theft during their 
lives. The lifetime prevalence rate for identity theft varied to 
some degree with age. Persons ages 25 to 64 had higher lifetime 
prevalence rates (16% to 17%) than persons ages 65 or older (14%) 
(not shown).

Methodology
***************

Data collection
*****************

The Identity Theft Supplement (ITS) was administered as a 
supplement to the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National 
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The NCVS collects data on 
crime reported and not reported to the police against persons age 
12 or older from a nationally representative sample of U.S. 
households. The sample includes persons living in group quarters 
(such as dormitories, rooming houses, and religious group 
dwellings) and excludes persons living in military barracks and 
institutional settings (such as correctional or hospital 
facilities) and persons who are homeless.

From January 1, 2014, through June 30, 2014, persons age 16 or 
older in sampled NCVS households received the ITS at the end of 
the NCVS interview. Proxy responders and those who complete the 
NCVS interview in a language other than English did not receive 
the ITS. All NCVS and ITS interviews were conducted using 
computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). Interviews were 
conducted by telephone or by personal visit. A final sample size 
of 64,287 of the original NCVS-eligible respondents completed the 
ITS questionnaire, resulting in a response rate of 90.6%.

The combined overall NCVS-ITS unit response rate for NCVS 
households, NCVS persons, and ITS persons was 66.1%. Because of 
the level of nonresponse, a bias analysis was conducted. To the 
extent that those who responded to the survey and those who did 
not differ in important ways, there is potential for bias in 
estimates from the survey data. However, the result of the 
nonresponse bias analysis suggested that there was little or no 
bias of substantive importance due to nonresponse in the ITS 
estimates.

The ITS collected individual data on the prevalence of and victim 
response to the attempted or successful misuse of an existing 
account, misuse of personal information to open a new account, or 
misuse of personal information for other fraudulent purposes. 
Respondents were asked whether they experienced any of these 
types of misuse during the 12 months prior to the interview. For 
example, persons interviewed in January 2014 were asked about 
identity theft incidents that occurred between January 2013 and 
November 2014. To simplify the discussion of the findings, this 
report refers to all identity theft experienced during the 12 
months prior to the interviews as occurring in 2014.

Persons who reported one or more incidents of identity theft 
during 2014 were asked more detailed questions about the incident 
and response to the incident, such as how they discovered the 
identity theft; financial, credit, and other problems resulting 
from the incident; time spent resolving associated problems; and 
reporting to police and credit bureaus. For most sections of the 
survey instrument, the ITS asked victims who experienced more 
than one incident during the 12-month reference period to 
describe only the most recent incident when answering questions. 
The ITS asked victims who experienced multiple incidents of 
identity theft during the year to report on the total financial 
losses suffered as a result of all incidents. The ITS asked both 
victims and nonvictims a series of questions about identity theft 
they experienced outside of the 12-month reference period and 
about measures they took to avoid or minimize the risk of 
becoming an identity theft victim.

**************************************
Comparison of 2014 findings to prior 
BJS identity theft statistics
**************************************

The 2012 and 2014 reports use data that differ from some previous 
BJS statistical collections on the topic of identity theft. With 
the exception of 2012, it was not possible to compare the 
identity theft estimates presented in this report to previously 
reported estimates.

Initial BJS reports on identity theft used household-level data 
from the core NCVS. Data were reported for the household as a 
whole rather than for individual respondents, and the questions 
were more limited, providing less detail on the characteristics 
of the incident and the victim response. For additional 
information, see Identity Theft, 2005 (NCJ 219411, BJS web, 
November 2007); Identity Theft Reported by Households, 2007 - 
Statistical Tables (NCJ 230742, BJS web, June 2010); and Identity 
Theft Reported by Households, 2005-2010 (NCJ 236245, BJS web, 
November 2011).

In 2008, BJS conducted the first ITS to the NCVS. Like the 2012 
and 2014 ITS, the 2008 ITS collected detailed information on 
victim experiences with identity theft from persons age 16 or 
older. For more information, see Victims of Identity Theft, 2008 
(NCJ 231680, BJS web, December 2010). Following the 
administration of the 2008 ITS, BJS made substantial changes to 
the survey instrument, making it difficult to compare across the 
2008 and 2012 datasets. (For details on these changes, see 
Victims of Identity Theft, 2012, NCJ 243779, BJS web, December 
2013). 

**************************************
Possible over-reporting of losses 
from jointly held accounts
**************************************

Persons may have experienced the unauthorized use of a jointly 
held account. Joint accounts present a difficulty with counting 
financial harm or loss because of the potential for double-
counting loss (e.g., both account holders report the same $500 
loss). Because financial loss was not attributed to a particular 
type of identity theft, victims of multiple types of identity 
theft may have experienced some financial loss from a joint 
account and some financial loss from an independently held 
account. Therefore, it was not possible to correct for any 
potential over-reporting due to joint account holders who may 
have been double counted.

Standard error computations
****************************
When national estimates are derived from a sample, as is the case 
with the ITS, caution must be taken when comparing one estimate 
to another. Although one estimate may be larger than another, 
estimates based on a sample have some degree of sampling error. 
The sampling error of an estimate depends on several factors, 
including the amount of variation in the responses, the size of 
the sample, and the size of the subgroup for which the estimate 
is computed. When the sampling error around the estimates is 
taken into consideration, the estimates that appear different may 
not be statistically different.

One measure of the sampling error associated with an estimate is 
the standard error. The standard error can vary from one estimate 
to the next. In general, for a given metric, an estimate with a 
smaller standard error provides a more reliable approximation of 
the true value than an estimate with a larger standard error. 
Estimates with relatively large standard errors are associated 
with less precision and reliability and should be interpreted 
with caution.

In order to generate standard errors around estimates from the 
ITS, the Census Bureau produces generalized variance function 
(GVF) parameters for BJS. The GVFs take into account aspects of 
the NCVS complex sample design and represent the curve fitted to 
a selection of individual standard errors based on the Jackknife 
Repeated Replication technique. The GVF parameters were used to 
generate standard errors for each point estimate (i.e., numbers 
or percentages) in the report.

In this report, BJS conducted tests to determine whether 
differences in estimated numbers and percentages were 
statistically significant once sampling error was taken into 
account. Using statistical programs developed specifically for 
the NCVS, all comparisons in the text were tested for 
significance. The primary test procedure used was Student’s t-
statistic, which tests the difference between two sample 
estimates. To ensure that the observed differences between 
estimates were larger than might be expected due to sampling 
variation, the significance level was set at the 95% confidence 
level.

Data users can use the estimates and the standard errors of the 
estimates provided in this report to generate a confidence 
interval around the estimate as a measure of the margin of error. 
The following example illustrates how standard errors can be used 
to generate confidence intervals:

** According to the ITS, in 2014, an estimated 7% of persons age 
16 or older experienced identity theft (see table 1). Using the 
GVFs, BJS determined that the estimate has a standard error of 
0.14 (see appendix table 7). A confidence interval around the 
estimate was generated by multiplying the standard errors by 
±1.96 (the t-score of a normal, two-tailed distribution that 
excludes 2.5% at either end of the distribution). Therefore, the 
confidence interval around the estimate is 7 ± (0.14 X 1.96) or 
6.73 to 7.27. In other words, if different samples using the same 
procedures were taken from the U.S. population in 2014, 95% of 
the time the percentage of persons who experienced identity theft 
would be between 6.73% and 7.27%.

In this report, BJS also calculated a coefficient of variation 
(CV) for all estimates, representing the ratio of the standard 
error to the estimate. CVs provide a measure of reliability and a 
means to compare the precision of estimates across measures with 
differing levels or metrics. In cases where the CV was greater 
than 50%, or the unweighted sample had 10 or fewer cases, the 
estimate was noted with a “!” symbol (interpret data with 
caution; estimate is based on 10 or fewer sample cases, or the 
coefficient of variation exceeds 50%).

Many of the variables examined in this report may be related to 
one another and to other variables not included in the analyses. 
Complex relationships among variables were not fully explored in 
this report and warrant more extensive analysis. Readers are 
cautioned not to draw causal inferences based on the results 
presented.
