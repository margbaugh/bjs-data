Highlights
************

* Major declines from 1994 to 1995 occurred in rates of both
personal crime, which includes violent crime and personal theft,
and property crime.

* Significant declines also occurred for most individual types
of crime included in the overall categories.  Motor vehicle
theft was the only type of crime for which rates did not
register a significant decline.

* Some changes varied with household income.  Most declines in
personal victimization were recorded for respondents in
households earning less than $15,000 a year.  None of the
differences in property crime for households earning less than
$7,500 a year was statistically significant.

* Personal victimization rates for the oldest and youngest age
groups declined less than those for the intermediate age groups.

*Personal crime declined slightly for blacks and Hispanics, 
from 1994 to 1995. Among blacks, aggravated assault declined 
significantly.

*Hispanic households showed declines for all types of property
crime.  Although black households showed a drop in overall
property victimization, none of the changes in burglary or 
household and motor vehicle theft was statistically significant.

* Except for motor vehicle theft, rates for all types of
household victimization declined more in the West than in other
regions.

In 1995 criminal victimization rates for U.S. residents age 12
or older declined for both personal and property crimes,
according to data collected from the National Crime
Victimization Survey.

The overall personal crime rate of 46.2 per 1,000 persons fell
13% from 1994.  Violent crime dropped 12.4% to 44.5 crimes per
1,000 persons age 12 or older.  Overall property crime declined
by 9.1% to a rate of 279.5 per 1,000 households.

These declines are the largest changes recorded for the broad
categories of crime since the survey began. (The overall crime
classifications changed slightly after 1992.)

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) measures as
personal crimes the violent offenses of rape and sexual assault,
robbery, and simple and aggravated assault.  Personal thefts are
also included among these personal crimes.  The NCVS measures
the property crimes of household burglary, motor vehicle theft,
and theft.

The decline was generally evident across a wide range of crime,
persons, and households.  Among personal crimes, simple assault
(-7.1%), aggravated assault (-24.1%), and personal theft
(-26.1%) had significant drops in victimization rates, with
robbery and rape/sexual assault also showing some evidence 
of decline.   All types of property crime contributed to the overall drop. 
However, only burglary (a 12.9% decrease, 1994-95) and household
theft (8.4%) registered declines strong enough to be statistically 
significant.

Although these reductions in victimization were broad-based,
different subpopulations varied in the degree to which they
experienced the reductions.

Finding the latest crime victimization information
****************************************************

This BJS report introduces a more complete presentation of the
recent results from the NCVS.  It departs from a concentration
on a single year by including the rates of crimes for over a
dozen categories of persons or households, 1992-95; however, 
findings from only 1994 and 1995 are discussed.  

The following three sources provide the fullest access to 
statistics from the victim survey:

*Thirteen tables, titled A to M on pages 6 to 12, contain the
rates per 1,000 summarized in the text.  Analysis may cut across
data from several tables so that table references are omitted
from the next four pages.

*The BJS Internet site (http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/) features
spreadsheets for the Bulletin tables, as well as for other data,
like those summarizing reporting to the police.

*BJS will publish companion NCVS reports to estimate long-term
trends, 1993-95 and to describe specific types of victimizations or
categories of victims, 1992-95.

Note:  Completed violent crimes include rape, sexual assault,
robbery with or without injury, aggravated assault with injury,
and simple assault with minor injury.  In 1993 the total population 
age 12 or older was 211,524,770 ; in 1994, 213,747,400; and in 1995,
215,709,450.  The total number of households in 1993 was 99,926,400; 
in 1994, 100,808,030; and in 1995, 101,888,380.
...Not applicable.
*The difference is significant at the 95% confidence level.
**The difference is significant at the 90% confidence level.	
aThe victimization survey cannot measure murder because of the 
inability to question the victim.  
bIncludes pocket picking, purse snatching, and attempted purse
snatching.
cIncludes thefts with unknown losses.  In 1993 this category 
accounted for 1,433,000 victimizations; in 1994, 1,241,000; 
and in 1995, 1,159,100.
						
************************
Personal crime, 1994-95
************************

---------------------
Sex of victim
---------------------

Overall violent crime rates declined for both male and female
victims from 1994 to 1995.  The rate for male victims had a
reduction of 10.7% to 53.2 per 1,000, while that for females
dropped by 14.4% to 36.4 per 1,000.  Total assault and
aggravated assault among both male and female victims declined. 
In addition, the rate of rape and sexual assault for female
victims dropped by 24.3% to 2.8 per 1,000.  Although estimates
for personal theft rates for males and females are lower in
1995, only that for males is a statistically significant change.

----------------------
Age of victim
----------------------

Declines in victimization rates varied, depending on the
age of the victim.  Most of the rate changes were focused on
intermediate ages.  The only significant change from 1994 to
1995 for those age 12-15 was a decline of 30.6% in the
aggravated assault rate to 15.4 per 1,000.

Except for personal theft, none of the declines among personal
crimes with victims age 50 or older was statistically
significant.  A significant decline in personal theft did occur
among those age 65 or older.

All intermediate age groups had significant declines in the
overall violent crime rate. All of the personal crime rate
declines for those age 20 to 24 were significant, except for
robbery.  The decline in simple assault, however, was a return
to a level more typical for this age group, after the peak of
56.4 per 1,000 in 1994.

In contrast to the 1994-95 drops in rates of total assault
among those age 16 to 49, differences for those age 50 or older
were not significant. Total assault includes aggravated and simple 
assault.  In contrast to the 1994-95 drops in rates of total assault 
among those age 16 to 49, there was a nonsignificant increase for 
those age 65 or older.  The total assault rate for the 16-19 age 
group declined, driven by the reduction in the rate of aggravated 
assault.  The total assault rate for persons age 35 to 49 also dropped,
largely as a consequence of a decline in simple assault for this 
age group.

---------------------
Race of victim
---------------------

Between 1994 and 1995 whites had significant reductions in
violent crime overall and in total assault, as well as
aggravated assault.  The overall violent crime rates for whites
declined by 12.8% to 43.1 per 1,000.

The only statistically reliable change for blacks was a drop of
24% in the aggravated assault rate to 12.6 per 1,000, although
there was some evidence of reductions in the overall personal
and violent crime rates and in rape/sexual assault.

---------------------
Hispanic origin
---------------------

Victimization rates for Hispanic respondents had no significant 
change in either violent crime or personal theft between 1994 
and 1995, although there was some evidence of declines in overall 
personal victimization rates, total violent crime, and total assault.

There was also some evidence of a decline in overall personal
victimization rates, total violent crime, and total assault for
Hispanics.  No significant differences existed between the
Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations in the degree of change
from 1994 to 1995 for any personal or violent crime.

----------------------------
Household income
--------------------------

Most significant declines in personal victimization from 1994 to
1995 were experienced by respondents in households earning less
than $15,000 a year.  Rates for these respondents declined for
total violent crime, rape/ sexual assault, and total assault. 
In addition, there was a drop in the victimization rates for
those in households earning between $7,500 and $14,999 per year
for both aggravated and simple assault.

The other measurable changes in victimization rates among income
groups were a drop in aggravated assault rates for those in
households with $15,000 to $24,999 annual income, an increase in
rape and sexual assault for respondents in households earning
between $35,000 and $49,999 yearly, and a decline in robbery
victimization for those with household incomes of $75,000 or
more.

When patterns of 1994-95 victimization rate changes are compared
across household income categories, no income level departed
significantly from the patterns present in other income groups.

-----------------
Region
-----------------

Changes in personal victimization rates from 1994 to 1995 were
not uniform across regions.

Northeast-- The only significant change  was a 27.6% decline 
in aggravated assault to a 1995 rate of 5.5 per 1,000
persons.

Midwest-- Rates for total violent crime and aggravated assault
fell, and robbery was down 30.6% to 4.3 per 1,000.

South-- Rates for total violent crime and aggravated assault
fell. Rates for rape/sexual assault (0.9 per 1,000) and robbery
(4.3 per 1,000) also dropped.

West-- Typically the region experiencing the highest rates of
violent victimization, the West had significant declines in all
categories of violent crime except rape/sexual assault and
robbery.

The declines of violent crimes overall, assault overall, and
simple assault in the West were greater than those in the
Northeast.  The decreases in robbery rates in the South and
Midwest were also a significant departure from the pattern in
the Northeast.

-----------------------
Urbanization
-----------------------

Urban areas have typically recorded the highest rates of violent
victimization, and rural areas the lowest.  In 1995 the rate of
violent victimization per 1,000 persons age 12 or older was 56.8 in
urban areas, 42.1 in suburban areas, and 34.9 in rural locations.

The broadest decline in violent victimization rates in 1995 from 
those in 1994 occured in the suburbs. The suburbs had significant
declines in all types of personal victimization except rape and 
sexual assault. The overall decrease was 15.1%.  This compares to a 10.7% 
drop in total violent victimization in urban areas and 11.0% drop
in rural areas.  In addition, urban and rural areas also showed
drops in victimization rates for total and aggravated assault.

Differences among urban, rural, and suburban areas in patterns
of change between 1994 and 1995 were not large enough to be
statistically significant.

**************************
Property crime, 1994-95
**************************

-----------------------------------------
Race of head of household
-----------------------------------------

White households showed reductions in rates of overall property
crime, burglary, and theft.  No decline for any type of property
crime was large enough for black households to produce a
statistically significant change, although there was an overall
decline in property crimes for black households.  

There was no significant change in motor vehicle theft rates for
either racial group, nor were the patterns of change for any
type of property crime statistically different between
households headed by a white or black.  

---------------------------------------------
Hispanic origin of head of household
---------------------------------------------

Both Hispanic and non-Hispanic households showed declines in
rates of burglary, household theft, and overall household
property crime.  The Hispanic, households also had significantly 
lower rates of motor vehicle theft, 1994-95, in contrast to 
non-Hispanic households, which did not experience such a
decrease.

--------------------------
Household income
--------------------------

No 1994-95 change in the rate of motor vehicle theft was
significant for any income grouping.  Households earning less
than $7,500 had no significant increase or decrease in any type
of property crime.  Households in all other income groups,
except for those earning $75,000 a year, showed a significant
decline in overall property crime victimization rates. 
Households in income categories from $7,500 to $49,999 a year
had a decline in burglary rates from 1994 to 1995.

Theft rates also declined 14.1% for households earning $7,500 to
$14,999 for a 1995 rate of 185.5 per 1,000 households.  This
compares to drops of 9.6% for households in the $35,000 -
$49,999 bracket (a 1995 rate of 232.6), 12.8% for households
earning $50,000 to $74,999 (a rate of 258.1), and 8.1% for those
earning $75,000 or more (a 1995 rate of 273.7 per thousand).

Household with incomes between $7,500 and $14,999 experienced
larger decreases in the rates of overall property crime and
theft than did households earning less than $7,500 or $15,000 to
$24,999.

-----------------
Regions
------------------

Although all regions of the country showed a decline in property
victimization rates in 1995, the individual types of crime
contributing to the overall drop varied across regions.  

All regions except the Northeast experienced a drop in theft
victimization in 1995.  All regions except the South had a
significant drop in burglary rates. The declines in the West for
property crime overall, burglary, and theft were significantly
larger than those in other regions.

----------------------
Urbanization
----------------------

Urban, suburban, and rural localities showed a decline in total
property victimization in 1995.  Property victimization in urban
areas dropped 7.6% for an overall rate of 347.9 per 1,000
households.  Property crime rates in suburban areas dropped 9.9%
(a rate of 267), and the rate in rural areas declined 11.4% (a
rate of 218.4 per 1,000 households).  All types of localities
registered a decline in theft victimization, while burglary
rates for urban and suburban areas also declined significantly
in 1995.  Motor vehicle theft rates for each category of
locality showed no significant change.

Urban, suburban, and rural households did not differ
significantly from each other in the amount of change for any
type of property crime.

----------------------------
Home ownership
----------------------------

Residents of rental housing typically experience property
victimization rates that are approximately 1.5 to 2 times those
of households in which the residents either own or are buying
their home.  In 1995 residents of both categories of housing
generally showed significant decreases in victimization rates
for overall property crime and its component crimes.  The one
exception was the lack of a significant change in motor vehicle
theft between 1994 and 1995 for respondents in rental housing.

****************
Murder
*****************

Data on murder and nonnegligent homicide are collected by the
FBI Uniform Crime Reports program.  Since 1993 both the number
and rate of murders nationally have steadily declined.  In 1995
the total number of murders recorded was 20,043, with a rate of
8.2 per 100,000 residents.  Rates have declined in all regions
of the country and in  larger cities.

Uniform Crime Reports data indicate that the characteristics of
murder victims and the types of weapons used have remained
relatively stable since 1992, with small proportionate decreases
in murders committed with firearms and against black or male 
victims.

Murder
*****************

Data on murder and nonnegligent homicide are collected by 
the FBI Uniform Crime Reports program.  Since 1993 both 
the number and rate of murders nationally have steadily 
declined.  In 1995 the total number of murders recorded 
was 20,043, with a rate of 8.2 per 100,000 residents.  
Rates have declined in all regions of the country 
and in  larger cities.

Uniform Crime Reports data indicate that the characteristics 
of murder victims and the types of weapons used have remained 
relatively stable since 1992, with small proportionate 
decreases in murders committed with firearms and against 
black or male victims.

Survey methodology
********************
       

The National Crime Victimization Survey measures personal and
household offenses, including crimes not reported to police, by
interviewing all the occupants age 12 and older of housing units
that have been selected to comprise a representative sample. 
The sample also includes persons living in group quarters, such
as dormitories, rooming houses, and religious group dwellings. 
Excluded are crew members of merchant vessels, Armed Forces
personnel living in military barracks or temporary housing, and
institutionalized persons, such as correctional facility inmates
and hospital or hospice patients.

A Bureau of the Census representative interviews each housing
unit at 6-month intervals, spreading out the complete sample of
household interviews over the entire year.  In 1995 the Bureau
of the Census interviewed approximately 100,000 residents in
56,000 housing units about the crimes they had experienced in
the previous 6 months.  Response rates were 96% of eligible
housing units and 92% of individuals in interviewed households.

Since sample survey data provide the estimates in the Bulletin,
these estimates are subject to sampling variation.  Comparisons
resented in this report without mention of  significance are
statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, meaning
that the estimated difference is greater than twice the standard
error.  The text also mentions patterns that were consistent
across multiple crime types but were not significant for
individual crime types.
