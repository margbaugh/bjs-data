Methodology   

Highlights

Personnel

*  As of June 1999, the more than 13,000
local police departments nationwide had an
estimated 556,631 full-time employees.  This
included about 436,000 sworn personnel.    

*  From 1997 to 1999, the number of full-time
local police employees increased by about
25,000, or 4.7%.   When only sworn personnel 
are considered, employment increased by about 
16,000 officers, or 3.8%.

*  As of June 1999, the Nation's largest local
police force, the New York City Police
Department, had 39,099 full-time officers. 
This was about 3 times as many as the next
largest, the Chicago Police Department
(13,307 officers). 

*  Forty-six departments employed 1,000 or
more officers, and these agencies accounted
for about a third of all local police officers. 
Nearly 800 departments employed just 1
officer.

*  About 282,000, or 65%, of all local police
officers had regularly assigned duties that
included responding to calls for service.  
The percent of officers assigned to respond 
to calls ranged from 90% in departments
serving fewer than 2,500 residents to less
than 60% in those serving 100,000 or more
residents.

Operations

*  From 1997 to 1999, the percent of
residents served by a department that
routinely used bicycle patrol increased 
from 66% to 76%, the percent served by a
department that used routine foot patrol
increased from 59% to 68%, and the percent
served by a department using one or both 
of these types of patrol increased from 
78% to 85%.

*  In 1999, 88% of local police departments,
employing 98% of all officers, participated 
in a 9-1-1 emergency telephone system. 
Sixty-seven percent of departments,
employing 90% of all officers, had enhanced
9-1-1 in 1999, compared to 53% of
departments, employing 80% of all officers,
in 1997.  

*  Ninety-two percent of departments,
employing 99% of all officers, were
responsible for investigating at least some
types of crimes.  About two-fifths handled
computer crime investigations, including
more than two-thirds of those serving 10,000
or more residents.

*  About 1 in 4 departments were responsible
for providing court security, and 1 in 6 
served civil process.  Just 1 in 12 
departments operated a jail.

*  Nearly all departments had traffic and
vehicle-related responsibilities such as
enforcement of traffic laws (99%), accident
investigation (98%), parking enforcement
(90%), and traffic direction and control
(87%).

Community policing

*  More than 90% of the departments
serving 25,000 or more residents had some
type of community policing plan, and a
majority of those serving 50,000 or more
residents had a formal, written plan.  

*  About 7 in 8 local police officers worked 
for a department that trained at least some 
new recruits in community policing skills 
such as problem-solving and building community
partnerships.  Most departments serving
10,000 or more residents offered such
training to all recruits.

*  Nearly two-thirds (64%) of departments
had full-time community policing officers. 
Nationwide, an estimated 91,000, or 21%, of
all local police officers were regularly
engaged in community policing activities.

*  Nearly a third (30%) of departments had
full-time school resource officers, with a
total of more than 9,100 assigned overall.

*  Nearly all departments serving 10,000 or
more residents regularly met with community
groups.  A majority of those serving 50,000
or more residents had formed problem-solving 
partnerships, and a majority of those serving 
25,000 or more residents provided community 
policing training to citizens.

Computers and information systems

*  All departments serving 25,000 or more
residents used computers during 1999, as
did nearly all of those serving 2,500 to
24,999 residents.  Just 1% of all local 
police officers worked for a department 
not using computers.

*  In 1999, 56% of local police dispatch
systems were computer-aided, including
nearly all of those in departments serving
50,000 or more residents.  In 1990, 40% of
departments used computer-aided dispatch. 

*  From 1990 to 1999, the percent of 
officers employed by a department with
computerized arrest records increased from
81% to 95%.  Increases were also observed
for criminal histories (60% to 79%), warrants
(68% to 78%), and summonses (28% to
52%).

*  About a third of departments used
computers for crime analysis (38%) and
crime mapping (32%) during 1999, including
most departments serving a population of
10,000 or more.

*  From 1990 to 1999, the percent of local
police officers working for a department
using in-field computers or terminals
increased from 31% to 73%.  Local police
departments had about 20 in-field computers
or terminals per 100 officers as of June
1999.
  
*  More than half of local police officers
worked in a department where at least some
officers in the field could use in-field
computers to access information on wanted
suspects (62%) or driving records (54%). 
About 2 in 5 officers were in departments
where calls for service (41%) or criminal
history (39%) records could be accessed.

Written policies and procedures

*  Nearly all local police officers worked 
for a department which had written policies 
or procedures pertaining to conduct and
appearance (99%), use of deadly force
(99%), domestic disputes (97%), citizen
complaints (96%), and the use of nonlethal
force (96%).

The LEMAS survey

During 1999, the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS), as a part of its Law Enforcement
Management and Administrative Statistics 
(LEMAS) program, surveyed a nationally 
representative sample of State and local 
law enforcement agencies operating nationwide.  
Previous LEMAS surveys were conducted in 
1987, 1990, 1993, and 1997.

This report presents data from the 1999
survey describing the more than 13,000 local
police departments operating in the United
States in terms of their personnel,
operations, community policing initiatives,
computers and information systems, and
written policies.  Comparisons are made with
prior years where appropriate.

Nearly all local police departments are
operated by municipal (86%) or township
(13%) governments.  As of 1996, about 100
general purpose local police departments
were operated by tribal governments, and
approximately 50 by county governments.

The 1999 LEMAS survey questionnaire was
mailed to 3,319 State and local law
enforcement agencies, and 3,246 of them
provided data for a response rate of 
97.8%. (See Methodology on page 20 for a
description of sampling procedures.) 

This report and its companion report
(Sheriffs' Offices 1999, May 2001, NCJ 
186479), summarize data collected from 
agencies of all sizes. Detailed agency-
by-agency tabulations from the 1999 LEMAS 
survey were previously published for 
agencies with 100 or more officers (see 
Law Enforcement Management and Administrative 
Statistics, 1999:  Data for Individual 
State and Local Agencies with 100 or 
More Officers, November 2000, NCJ 184481).   

Personnel

As of June 30, 1999, local police
departments had an estimated 556,631
full-time employees.  About 436,000, or 
78%, of full-time local police department
employees were sworn officers.  This
accounted for nearly two-thirds (64%) of
full-time  officers working for State and 
local general purpose law enforcement 
agencies nationwide.  Local police departments 
also employed about 28,000 part-time sworn
officers.

The estimated 120,449 full-time nonsworn
local police employees comprised nearly half
(47%) of all nonsworn employees in general
purpose law enforcement agencies.  Local
police departments had about 36,000
part-time nonsworn employees.
 
From 1990 to 1999, local police employment
increased by about 97,000, or 21% -- an
average of 2.3% annually.  The number of
full-time sworn officers increased by about
73,000, or 20%, during this period.
 
There were about 25,000 more full-time local
police employees in 1999 than in 1997, an
increase of 4.7%.  When only sworn personnel 
are considered, local police employment 
increased by about 16,000, or 3.8%, from 
1997 to 1999.  

From 1990 to 1999, the number of full-time
civilian local police employees rose from
96,890 to 120,449, an increase of 24.3%. 
This included an increase of about 9,000, 
or 8.2%, from 1997 to 1999. 

Nationwide, 573, or 4.2%, of local police
departments employed at least 100 sworn
personnel.  This included 46 departments
with 1,000 or more officers.  An estimated
7,095, or 52.4%, of departments employed
fewer than 10 sworn personnel, including
nearly 800 with just 1 officer.
 
About a third of all full-time local police
officers were employed by a department with
1,000 or more officers, and about three-fifths
were employed by a department with at least
100 officers. Departments with fewer than 10
sworn personnel accounted for about 5% of all 
local police officers.
 
Although 77% of local police departments
served fewer than 10,000 residents, these
agencies employed just 15% of all local
police officers.  About half of all officers
served a jurisdiction with 100,000 or more
residents, including nearly a fourth in
jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents. 


With 39,099 officers, New York City had a
police force about 3 times as large as
Chicago, the city with the second largest
force.  While departments serving the largest
cities had thousands of officers on average,
those serving fewer than 2,500 residents had
an average of just 3 full-time officers each.

Overall, nearly two-thirds (65%) of full-time
sworn local police employees had regularly
assigned duties that included responding to
calls for service.  By population category, 
the proportion of officers responding to calls
ranged from about 3 in 5 in departments
serving 50,000 or more residents, to more
than 4 in 5 in those serving fewer than
10,000 residents.  

Overall, 89% of sworn personnel worked in
field operations.  Officers working in the 
field operations area, but not assigned to 
respond to calls, often performed supervisory 
or investigative duties.  

The next highest area of employment for
sworn personnel was administration (6.2%). 
This included positions related to the chief's
office, financial affairs, human resources,
and internal affairs.  About 4% of officers 
handled technical support duties primarily 
related to communications, fleet management, 
crime prevention, or training.  Few officers 
were assigned duties related to jail (0.3%) 
or court (0.3%) operations.

Among civilian local police employees, most
worked in technical support jobs (68.7%). 
Other areas of employment for nonsworn
employees included field operations (11.1%),
administration (9.2%), and jail operations
(4.7%). 

As of June 30, 1999, local police
departments collectively employed 97.6% of
the maximum number of sworn personnel
authorized by their budgets, and 96.5% of
their authorized civilian employee strength. 
Actual-to-authorized ratios for sworn
personnel ranged from about 100% among
departments serving fewer than 2,500
residents to about 94% in those serving
250,000 to 499,999 residents.   For
nonsworn employees, departments serving
2,500 to 24,999 residents (99%) had the
highest ratio, and those serving 500,000 
to 999,999 residents (91%), the lowest.

Some local police departments partly offset
officer shortages through the use of
supplemental personnel such as sworn
reserve or auxiliary officers.  As of June 
30, 1999, 43% of departments were using
reserve or auxiliary sworn officers, with 
an average of 2 full-time and 5 part-time 
officers each.

Some departments utilized nonsworn
volunteers such as community service
officers or police service aides.  As of 
June 30, 1999, 11% were using community 
service officers or police service aides, 
with an average of 3 full-time and 2 part-
time each.  Twelve percent used other 
types of nonsworn volunteers, with an 
average of 3 part-time volunteers each. 

Nationwide, local police departments had
about 14,000 full-time reserve officers and
31,000 part-time reserve officers (not shown
in table).  They also had about 4,200
community service officers and police
service aides with about two-thirds of these
working full-time.  Departments utilized an
additional 28,000 nonsworn volunteers, with
nearly all working part-time.  

Operations

Stations and substations

As of June 30, 1999, local police
departments operated an estimated 3,566
district or precinct stations and 4,021
neighborhood or community substations that
were separate from headquarters.  More
than 9 in 10 departments serving 250,000 or
more residents had district or precinct
stations, and more than 8 in 10 had
community substations.  About 7 in 10
departments serving 50,000 to 249,999
residents had community substations. 

Among departments operating such facilities,
the average number of district or precinct
stations ranged from 16 in jurisdictions with
1 million or more residents to 1 in those with
fewer than 50,000 residents.  For
substations, the average number operated
ranged from 14 in jurisdictions with 1 
million or more residents to 1 in those 
with fewer than 10,000 residents.  
 
Patrol and response

All local police departments provided 
patrol services during 1999, and all used
automobiles for at least some of their 
routine patrol units.  About half used foot 
patrol units, including nearly all departments 
serving a population of 1 million or more.  
Departments with routine foot patrol employed 
about three-fourths of all officers.

Nearly all departments (96%) serving
250,000 or more residents had routine bike
patrols, as did more than 80% of departments 
serving a population of 50,000 to 249,999.  
Overall, 34% of departments, employing 78% 
of all officers, used bicycle patrol units 
on a routine basis.   

Just 10% of departments used motorcycle
patrol units on a routine basis, although 
86% of those serving 100,000 or more residents
did so.  Departments using routine motorcycle 
patrol employed about three-fifths of all 
officers.   Overall, few departments routinely 
scheduled marine (3%) or horse (1%) patrol 
units.  However, a majority of the departments 
serving 500,000 or more residents did so.  

About a fourth (24%) of departments used
foot patrol for special events only. Nine
percent used bicycles for special events
patrol, but not routine patrol.  Smaller
percentages used motorcycle (3%), horse
(2%), or marine (2%) patrol units 
exclusively for special events.

In 1999, 63% of departments used foot
and/or bicycle patrol on a routine basis, 
up from 60% in 1997.  Nearly all 
departments serving 50,000 or more residents 
used one or both of these patrol types, 
often in conjunction with community policing
initiatives designed to enhance police-
community interaction.

Of the approximately 195 million U.S. 
residents served by a local police department, 
85% were served by one that used foot and/
or bicycle patrol on a routine basis during 
1999, compared to 78% in 1997.   From 1997 
to 1999 the percentage of residents served 
by a department using routine bicycle patrol 
went from 66% to 76%, and the percentage 
served by a department with foot patrol from 
59% to 68%.

Dispatch

Thirty-eight percent of local police
departments, employing 76% of all officers,
had responsibility for dispatching citizen 
calls for service.  This included more 
than 80% of the departments serving a 
population of 250,000 or more and more than 
70% of those serving a population of 10,000 
to 249,999.    

9-1-1 emergency telephone system

In 1999, 88% of local police departments,
employing 98% of all officers, participated
in an emergency telephone system whereby one 
of their units could be dispatched as a 
result of a call to 9-1-1 or its equivalent.  
More than 90% of the departments in each 
population category of 2,500 or more were 
9-1-1 participants, including all of those 
serving 250,000 or more residents. 

Three-fourths of local police 9-1-1 systems
were enhanced, capable of pinpointing the
location of a caller automatically.  More 
than 90% of  departments serving a population 
of 25,000 or more had enhanced 9-1-1,
compared to about half of those serving
fewer than 2,500 residents.

The 67% of local police departments
participating in an enhanced 9-1-1 system 
in 1999 represented a sizable increase over
1997, when 53% were participants.  It was
nearly 4 times the proportion with such a
capability in 1990 (18%).  In 1999, 9 in 10
local police officers worked in a department
with enhanced 9-1-1 compared to 5 in 10
officers in 1990.

From 1990 to 1999 the percentage of
residents served by a local police
department with 9-1-1 increased from 79% 
to 98%.  During this time, the percentage 
of residents covered by an enhanced 9-1-1
system nearly doubled from 48% to 91%.  

Crime investigation

Overall, 92% of local police departments,
employing 99% of all officers, conducted
investigations of at least some types of
crimes.  Eighty-seven percent had
investigative responsibility for violent 
crimes such as rape, robbery, or assault, 
including nearly all of those serving a 
population of 10,000 or more.   About 3 in 
4 departments handled homicide investigations, 
including all of those serving 250,000 or 
more residents, and more than 90% of those 
serving 10,000 to 249,999 residents. 

Ninety percent of departments were
responsible for investigating property 
crimes such as burglary, larceny, or motor 
vehicle theft.  All departments serving 
250,000 or more residents handled such 
investigations, as did more than 9 in 10 
departments serving 2,500 to 299,999 
residents. 

Sixty-three percent of all departments 
were responsible for arson investigations, 
with those serving 2,500 to 99,999 residents
the most likely to handle such incidents. 

About a third of departments were
responsible for investigating environmental
crimes.  No more than 42% of the departments 
in any population category handled such 
investigations.

Two-fifths of departments handled computer
crime investigations, including more than
90% of those serving a population of 500,000
or more, and about 70% of those serving
10,000 to 499,999 residents.

Investigative support functions

A fourth of all local police departments 
were responsible for fingerprint processing.  
This included  all departments serving a
population of 1 million or more, and 
about 9 in 10 serving 100,000 to 999,999 
residents. Few departments provided crime 
lab services (4%) or performed ballistics 
tests (2%), although more than half of
departments serving 250,000 or more
residents were responsible for these
functions. 

Court-related functions

Eighty-five percent of departments,
employing 84% of all officers, were
responsible for executing arrest warrants.  
This included at least 74% of the
departments in each population category.

Twenty-six percent of departments,
employing 25% of all officers, provided  
court security.  No more than 32% of
the departments in any population category
performed such services.

An estimated 16% of departments,
employing 9% of all officers, were
responsible for serving civil process.  
Departments serving fewer than 2,500
residents (21%) were the most likely to
perform this function.

Detention facilities

Just 8% of local police departments,
employing 14% of all officers, operated 
a jail during 1999.  No more than 19% of 
the departments in any population category
operated a jail, a function most commonly
handled by sheriffs' offices.

Sixteen percent of local police departments,
employing 43% of all officers, operated a
temporary holding (lockup) facility for
overnight detention that was separate from 
a jail.  The percentage of departments with 
a lockup ranged from 56% in the largest
jurisdictions to 4% in the smallest.

Departments in the largest jurisdictions 
were also the most likely (75%) to have 
temporary holding cells not used for overnight
detention.  Just 6% of the departments in the
smallest jurisdictions had them.  Overall,
19% of departments, employing 47% of all
officers, had this type of holding cell.
 
Traffic and vehicle-related functions

Nearly all local police departments had
primary responsibility for enforcing 
traffic laws (99%) and investigating traffic 
accidents (98%).  Large percentages also 
handled traffic direction and control (87%), 
and parking enforcement (90%) duties.   

Nearly half of departments provided school
crossing services (47%), including about
three-fifths of those serving 10,000 to
999,999 residents.

About 3 in 8 departments were responsible
for enforcement of commercial vehicle laws. 
This included more than 3 in 5 departments
serving 250,000 or more residents.

Special operations functions

Twenty-one percent of local police
departments performed tactical operations,
commonly associated with SWAT (Special
Weapons and Tactics) teams.  These
departments employed 71% of all local 
police officers.  All departments serving 
500,000 or more residents performed SWAT 
operations, as did a majority of 
those serving 25,000 to 499,999 residents.

An estimated 19% of departments,
employing 37% of all officers, had 
responsibility for search and rescue
operations.  More than half of the
departments serving a population of 
500,000 or more performed this function.
  
Five percent of departments, employing 
34% of all officers, were responsible for
underwater recovery operations.  This
included a majority of the departments
serving 500,000 or more residents.   

Bomb disposal was handled by 3% of
departments, including 88% of those serving
500,000 or more residents, and 76% of those
serving a population of 250,000 to 499,999. 
Departments handling bomb disposal
employed 42% of all officers.

Special public safety functions

Fifty-eight percent of departments were
responsible for animal control services in
their jurisdiction.  This included about
three-fifths of the departments serving 
fewer than 10,000 residents, and about half 
of those serving 10,000 to 99,999 residents. 
Departments handling animal control
employed 38% of all officers.

Other special public safety functions handled
by local police departments included civil
defense (21%), emergency medical services
(16%), and fire services (12%).  Departments
performing civil defense functions employed
13% of all officers, those handling
emergency medical services 9%, and those
providing fire services, 5%.

Community policing

Community policing is a philosophy that
promotes and supports organizational
strategies to address the causes and reduce
the fear of crime and social disorder through
problem-solving strategies and community
partnerships.  A fundamental shift from
traditional reactive policing, community
policing stresses the prevention of crime. 
Community policing supports and empowers
front-line officers, decentralizes command,
and encourages innovative problem solving. 
(See Community Policing in Local Police
Departments, 1997 and 1999, BJS Special
Report, February 2001, NCJ 184794.)

In 1999, 17% of local police departments,
employing 45% of all officers,  had a formal,
written community policing plan.  A majority
of the departments serving 50,000 or more
residents had a written plan, including about
two-thirds of those serving a population of
100,000 to 999,999.  Departments serving
fewer than 2,500 residents (9%) were the
least likely to have a written plan.  

In each of the four major population categories, 
a majority of local police departments had 
either a formal, written community policing plan 
or an informal, unwritten plan.

Departments serving fewer than 50,000
residents were more likely to have an
unwritten plan than a formal, written one. 
Overall, 91% of all local police officers
worked for a department with some type of
community policing plan.

Community policing training

During the 2-year period ending June 30,
1999, 54% of all local police departments,
employing 87% of all officers, trained 
at least some of their new officer recruits 
in community policing skills such as
problem-solving and developing community
partnerships. 

Forty-one percent of departments, employing
67% of all officers, trained all new 
recruits in community policing.  The larger 
the jurisdiction, the more likely a department
trained all recruits in community policing,
ranging from 95% of those serving 500,000
or more residents to 24% of those serving
fewer than 2,500 residents.

Sixty-three percent of departments,
employing 85% of all officers, trained at 
least some in-service officers during the 
2-year period.  Twenty-eight percent of
departments, employing 32% of all officers,
trained all of their in-service officers in
community policing.

Community policing personnel

Overall, 64% of local police departments,
serving 87% of all local police officers, 
had full-time sworn personnel serving as
community policing officers, community
resource officers, community relations
officers, or otherwise regularly engaged 
in community policing activities.  As
of June 30, 1999, an estimated 91,000, 
or 21%, of local police officers served 
in this capacity.

About 9 in 10 departments serving a
population of 25,000 or more had full-time
community policing officers. Those serving 
a population of 1 million  or more employed
about 1,700 such officers on average. 
Among departments serving fewer than
2,500 residents that had community policing
officers, an average of 2 each were so
designated.

The percentage of full-time sworn personnel
designated as community policing officers
was highest in the smallest jurisdictions
(40%).  Departments serving jurisdictions
with 1 million or more residents had the 
next highest percentage -- 28%.  Percentages 
in other population categories ranged from 
24% in those with 2,500 to 9,999 residents, 
to 13% in those with 250,000 to 999,999
residents. 

Thirty percent of local police departments,
employing 62% of all officers, had full-
time school resource officers during 1999.  
These officers use a community policing 
approach to provide a safe environment for 
students and staff.  In addition to handling 
calls for service within the school, they 
work closely with school administrators 
and staff to prevent crime and disorder 
by monitoring crime trends, problem areas, 
cultural conflicts, and other areas of 
concern.

As of June 30, 1999, local police
departments had about 9,100 full-time 
sworn personnel assigned as school 
resource officers.  A majority of the 
departments serving 10,000 or more 
residents had school resource officers.  
Among departments using them, the average 
number of school resource officers ranged 
from 66 in departments serving a 
population of 1 million or more, to 1 
in those serving fewer than 2,500 
residents. 

Community-oriented policies 
and programs

Forty-two percent of all local police
departments, employing 78% of all local
police officers, gave patrol officers
responsibility for specific geographic 
areas or beats during 1999.  This included 
about 90% of the departments serving a 
population of 50,000 or more.  Just 8% of 
departments, employing 43% of all officers, 
assigned cases to investigators by geographic 
area, although a majority of the departments
serving a population of 100,000 or 
more did so.

Twenty-nine percent of departments,
employing 48% of all officers, actively
encouraged patrol officers to become
involved in problem-solving projects.  
A majority of the departments serving a
population of 25,000 or more had such a
policy.
 
Eighteen percent of all departments,
employing 33% of all officers, included
problem-solving projects in the performance
evaluation criteria for patrol officers.  
This included about half of the departments
serving a population of 100,000 or more.  

During the 2-year period ending June 30,
1999, 25% of local police departments,
employing 44% of all officers, formed
partnerships with community groups, local
agencies, or others through written
agreements.  This included nearly two-
thirds of the departments serving 100,000 
to 999,999 residents.  

Twenty-four percent of departments,
employing 68% of all officers, offered 
training to citizens on community policing 
topics such as community mobilization and
problem-solving.  A majority of departments
serving 25,000 or more residents offered
such training. 

About 4 in 5 departments, including nearly 
all of those serving 10,000 or more residents,
regularly met with community groups during
the 2-year period ending June 30, 1999. 
Departments holding regular meetings
employed 96% of all local police officers.

About 6 in 7 officers worked for a department
that regularly met with school groups (85%)
and neighborhood associations (84%).  The
percentages for other types of groups were
as follows:  business (78%), senior citizen
(70%), domestic violence (66%), youth
service (65%), tenant (59%), and religious
(59%). 

Citizen surveys

Nearly 3 in 10 local police departments,
employing about half of all officers, 
surveyed citizens in their jurisdiction 
during the year ending June 30, 1999.  
This included a majority of the departments 
serving a population of 25,000 or more.

Twenty-five percent of departments,
employing 39% of all officers, surveyed
citizens' about their satisfaction with 
police services.  Eighteen percent of 
departments, employing 32% of all officers, 
surveyed citizens regarding their perception 
of crime problems.  Eleven percent of 
departments, employing 22% of officers, 
surveyed citizens about their personal 
crime experiences.

A majority of departments conducting
surveys used the data to provide information
to officers (72%), evaluate program
effectiveness (57%), or prioritize crime-
related problems (52%).  About two-fifths 
used the information for training officers 
(42%), formulating policy and procedures 
(42%), or allocating resources to targeted
neighborhoods (39%).  Sixteen percent used
it to redistrict beats or reporting areas.

Citizen access to crime statistics
Seventy-three percent of local police
departments, employing 92% of all local
police officers, provided citizens with 
routine access to crime statistics or 
crime maps. This included more than 90% 
of departments serving 10,000 or more 
residents.

Departments were most likely to provide
access to crime statistics at the city or
county level (60% of departments employing
83% of all officers).  An estimated 23% of
departments, employing 54% of all officers,
provided routine access to crime statistics 
by neighborhood. 
 
Sixteen percent of departments, employing
36% of all officers, made statistics available
at the street or block level, and 14% of them,
employing 38% of all officers, provided
statistics by patrol beat.  Just 9% of
departments provided district or precinct
crime statistics.  However, most departments
serving 250,000 or more residents did so,
and departments providing such statistics
employed 47% of all officers.

Ninety percent of the departments that
provided citizens with routine access to
crime statistics or crime maps made them
available to those who inquired in person. 
Just over half provided statistics in 
response to requests made by telephone 
(57%) in writing (56%).  About two-fifths 
of departments routinely published crime
statistics in newspapers (40%) or agency
reports (38%).  Some provided access to
statistics by fax (16%), radio (14%),
newsletter (11%), television (11%), or 
the Internet (10%).

Computers and information systems
 
Administrative functions

All local police departments serving 25,000
or more residents, and 97% of  those serving
2,500 to 24,999 residents, used computers
for administrative purposes during 1999. 
Just 1% of local police officers worked for 
a department not using computers.  An 
estimated 78% of departments, employing 96% 
of all officers, used personal computers 
(PC's) in 1999.  This was an increase over 
1997 when 67% of departments, employing 93% 
of officers, used them.  In 1999 all depart-
ments serving 250,000 or more residents, and 
99% of those serving 25,000 to 249,999 
residents, used PC's. 

Twenty-four percent of departments,
employing 59% of all officers, used
mainframes during 1999.  This was a
decrease from 1997 when 37% of departments, 
employing 75% of all officers, used them.  

Local police departments stored various
types of administrative records in  
computer files during 1999.  Forty-six 
percent of them, employing 84% of all 
officers, had computerized personnel files.  
This included a majority of departments 
serving 2,500 or more residents and more 
than 90% of those serving a population of 
100,000 or more.  

Forty-four percent, employing 69% of all
officers, had computerized inventory files. 
This included a majority of departments
serving 10,000 or more residents.  An

files.  This included a majority of 
departments serving 25,000 or more 
residents. 

Computer-aided dispatch

Among the approximately 5,000 local police
departments with responsibility for dis-
patching calls for service, more than half
(56%) used computer-aided dispatch systems.  
This included all departments serving a 
population of 500,000 or more, and nearly 
all departments serving 50,000 to 499,999 
residents.

The percentage of local police department
dispatch systems that were computerized
increased significantly from 1990 to 1999. 
For example, among departments that
handled dispatch functions and served
250,000 or more residents, the percent with
computer-aided dispatch rose from 88% to
99%.

From 1990 to 1999, among departments
serving 50,000 to 249,999 residents, the
percentage with computerized dispatch
increased from 72% to 97%; among those
serving 10,000 to 49,999 residents, from
48% to 74%; and in jurisdictions with a
population of less than 10,000, the
percentage of dispatch systems that were
computerized increased from 16% to 36%.  

Offender and suspect records

Seventy percent of local police departments
had computerized arrest records in 1999. 
This included nearly all departments serving

summons records.  However, about two-thirds 
of the departments serving a population 
of 1 million or more had them, as did about 
half of those serving 10,000 to 999,999 
residents. 

From 1990 to 1999 the percentage of
departments with computerized information
on arrests, criminal histories, warrants, 
and summonses increased substantially. 
Accordingly, the percentage of officers
employed by a department storing these
types of records in a computerized format
also increased.

The percentage of local police officers
working for departments with computerized
arrest records increased from 81% in 1990 to
95% in 1999.  Similar increases in computerization 
were observed for information pertaining to 
criminal histories (from 60% in 1990 to 79% 
in 1999), warrants (from 68% to 78%), and 
summonses (from 28% to 52%).

Nationwide local police departments had 20
in-field computers or terminals per 100
officers as of June 30, 1999.  Those serving
100,000 to 499,999 residents had the highest
ratio, 30 per 100.  The next highest ratio, 
24 per 100, was among departments serving a

than 10,000 residents, from 2% to 22%.
 
In 1999, 20% of local police departments,
employing 38% of all officers, used in-field
computers or terminals to produce field
reports.  Nineteen percent of departments,
employing 59% of all officers, used them for
at least some in-field communications. 

In about a fifth of departments, at least 
some officers could use in-field computers 
or terminals to access information on wanted
suspects (21%) or vehicles (20%).  This
included a majority of the departments
serving 25,000 or more residents.

In 18% of departments, officers in the field

appearance (99%), use of deadly force
(99%), handling of domestic disputes (97%),
handling of citizen complaints (96%), and
use of nonlethal force (96%).

Methodology

The Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey
collects data from a nationally representative
sample of the approximately 19,000 publicly
funded State and local law enforcement
agencies in the United States.  

This report presents data from the 1999 survey
describing local police departments in terms of
their personnel, operations, community policing
initiatives, computers and information systems,
and written policies and procedures.  

The 1999 LEMAS survey questionnaire was
mailed to 3,319 State and local law enforcement
agencies.  The initial mailing of the 
questionnaire was conducted in June 1999, and, 
unless otherwise indicated, June 30, 1999, was 
used as the reference date for survey questions.  

Allowing for the exclusion of certain types of
special jurisdiction police, 895 law enforcement
agencies in the U.S.  with 100 or more sworn
officers as of June 30, 1996 were included 
in the sample as self-representing (SR) agencies.  
This included 529 local police departments, 306
sheriffs' offices, the 49 primary State law
enforcement agencies, and 11 special jurisdiction
police agencies.

The self-representing (SR) agencies were
supplemented by a nationally representative
sample of agencies with fewer than 100 sworn
officers.  These nonself-representing (NSR)
agencies were chosen using a stratified random
sample with cells based on the type of agency
(local police, sheriff, or special police), size of
population served, and number of sworn officers. 
The 2,424 NSR agencies selected included 1,556
local police departments, 694 sheriffs' offices, 
and 174 special jurisdiction police agencies.  

A total of 3,246 agencies responded to the 1999
LEMAS survey for a response rate of 97.8%. 
This included 883 SR agencies and 2,363 NSR
agencies.  The final database includes 2,052 
local police departments, 967 sheriffs' 
offices, 178 special jurisdiction police 
departments, and the 49 primary State law
enforcement agenies.

The base weight for all SR agencies is 1.  
For NSR local police departments, the base 
weights are determined by number of sworn 
officers employed as of June 30, 1996.  For 
agencies with 0 to 6 sworn officers, the 
base weight is 15.55; for 7 to 13 officers, 
it is 9.65; for 14 to 23 officers, it is 7.
09; for 24 to 39 officers, it is 4.95; for 40 
to 62 officers, it is 3.38; and for 63 to 99
officers, the base weight is 2.14.

The final weight associated with every agency,
both SR and NSR, is the product of the base
weight, a factor that adjusted for changes in 
the universe since 1996, and a factor that 
adjusted for any nonresponding agencies in each 
cell. 

Some responding agencies did not fully complete
the LEMAS questionnaire.  When an agency did
not supply a response to an item, median value
imputation or ratio imputation was used.  Median
value imputation uses the median value of an
item reported by agencies in the same sample
cell.  Ratio imputation uses the median value of
a ratio reported by agencies in the same sample
cell. 

Median value imputation was used to impute
counts of facilities, reserve sworn officers,
community service officers, and nonsworn
volunteers.  Ratio imputation was used to 
impute counts of employees and computer 
equipment. Every imputed item on the database 
has an indicator that the value has been 
imputed. Complete documentation regarding 
sampling procedures and nonresponse adjustments 
is available upon request.

Because the data from agencies with fewer than
100 sworn personnel were collected from a
sample, the results are subject to sampling 
error. Statements of comparison in this report 
have been tested to ensure that observed 
differences between values are significant at 
2 standard errors (the 95%-confidence level) 
or higher.  The survey data are also subject 
to response and processing errors.
