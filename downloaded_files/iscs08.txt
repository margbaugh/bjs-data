The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) is the
primary federal entity for collecting, analyzing,
and reporting data related to education in the United States
and other nations. It fulfills a congressional man-
date to collect, collate, analyze, and report full and
complete statistics on the condition of education in the
United States; conduct and publish reports and specialized
analyses of the meaning and significance of such
statistics; assist state and local education agencies in
improving their statistical systems; and review and report
on education activities in other countries.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) is the primary federal
entity for collecting, analyzing, publishing, and
disseminating statistical information about crime, its
perpetrators and victims, and the operation of the justice
system at all levels of government. These data are critical
to federal, state, and local policymakers in combating
crime and ensuring that justice is both efficient and
evenhanded.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Our nation's schools should be safe havens for teaching and
learning, free of crime and violence. Any instance of crime
or violence at school not only affects the individuals
involved, but also may disrupt the educational process and
affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding
community (Henry 2000). 


Ensuring safer schools requires establishing good indicators
of the current state of school crime and safety across the
nation and regularly updating and monitoring these
indicators. This is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and
Safety. 

This report is the eleventh in a series of annual
publications produced jointly by the National Center for
Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education Sciences
(IES), in the U.S. Department of Education, and the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS) in the U.S. Department of Justice.
This report presents the most recent data available on school
crime and student safety. The indicators in this report are
based on information drawn from a variety of data sources,
including national surveys of students, teachers, and
principals. Sources include results from a study of violent
deaths in schools, sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Education and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;
the National Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime
Supplement to the survey, sponsored by the BJS and NCES,
respectively; the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the
Schools and Staffing Survey and School Survey on Crime and
Safety, both sponsored by NCES. The most recent data
collection for each indicator varied by survey, from 2003 04
to 2007. Each data source has an independent sample design,
data collection method, and questionnaire design or is the
result of a universe data collection. All comparisons
described in this report are statistically significant at the
.05 level. In 2005 and 2007, the final response rate for
students ages 12 18 for the School Crime Supplement (60
percent),***(Footnote 1 Analysis of unit nonresponse found
evidence that for some demographic groups, there may be a
response bias in that the nonrespondents have different
characteristics than those who responded. Weighting
adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates,
should have reduced the problem. Therefore, while the results
are valid, in interpreting the data from Indicators 3, 8, 10,
11, 17, 18, and 21, a reader should understand that these
estimates may have larger and unmeasured sources of survey
error than other estimates).*** fell below NCES statistical
standards; therefore, interpret the 2005 and 2007 data from
Indicators 3, 8, 10, 11, 17, 18, and 21 with caution.
Additional information about methodology and the datasets
analyzed in this report may be found in appendix A. 

This report covers topics such as victimization, fights,
bullying, classroom disorder, weapons, student perceptions of
school safety, teacher injury, and availability and student
use of drugs and alcohol. Indicators of crime and safety are
compared across different population subgroups and over time.
Data on crimes that occur away from school are offered as a
point of comparison where available.

KEY FINDINGS

In the 2006 07 school year, an estimated 55.5 million
students were enrolled in prekindergarten through grade 12
(U.S. Department of Education 2008). Preliminary data show
that among youth ages 5 18, there were 35 school-associated
violent deaths ***(Footnote 2 School-associated violent death
is defined as "a homicide, suicide, legal intervention
(involving a law enforcement officer), or unintentional
firearm-related death in which the fatal injury occurred on
the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in
the United States." Victims of school-associated violent
deaths included students, staff members, and others who are
not students).*** from July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007
(27 homicides and 8 suicides) (Indicator 1). In 2006, among
students ages 12 18, there were about 1.7 million victims of
nonfatal crimes at school,***(Footnote 3 See appendix B for a
detailed definition of "at school)."***  including 909,500
theftsv ***(Footnote 4 Theft includes purse snatching, pick
pocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts except
motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which
threat or use of force is involved).*** and 767,000 violent
crimes ***(Footnote 5 Violent crimes include serious violent
crimes and simple assault).***  (simple assault and serious
violent crime ***(Footnote 6 Serious violent crimes include
rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault).***
(Indicator 2). During the 2005 06 school year, 86 percent of
public schools reported that at least one violent crime,
theft, or other crime occurred at their school (Indicator 6).
In 2007, 8 percent of students in grades 9 12 reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon in the previous 12
months, and 22 percent reported that illegal drugs were made
available to them on school property (Indicators 4 and 9).
The following section presents key findings from each section
of the report. 

Violent Deaths

*From July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007, there were 27
homicides and 8 suicides of school-age youth (ages 5 18) at
school (Indicator 1), or about 1 homicide or suicide of a
school-age youth at school per 1.6 million students enrolled
during the 2006 07 school year. 

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization 

*In 2006, students ages 12 18 were victims of about 1.7
million nonfatal crimes at school, including thefts
***(Footnote 4 Theft includes purse snatching, pick
pocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts except
motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which
threat or use of force is involved).***  and violent crimes
***(Footnote 5 Violent crimes include serious violent crimes
and simple assault).***(Indicator 2).

*More students ages 12 18 were victims of theft at school
than away from school in 2006 (Indicator 2). In 2006, 34
thefts per 1,000 students occurred at school compared to 25
thefts per 1,000 students that occurred away from school.
***(Footnote 4 Theft includes purse snatching, pick
pocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts except
motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which
threat or use of force is involved).***  

*In 2007, 4 percent of students ages 12 18 reported being
victimized at school during the previous 6 months: 3 percent
reported theft,***(Footnote 4 Theft includes purse snatching,
pick pocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts except
motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which
threat or use of force is involved).***   and 2 percent
reported violent victimization ***(Footnote 5 Violent crimes
include serious violent crimes and simple assault).***
(Indicator 3). Less than half of a percent of students
reported serious violent victimization.***(Footnote 6 Serious
violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
aggravated assault).***
 

*In 2007, 10 percent of male students in grades 9 12 reported
being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property
in the past year, compared to 5 percent of female students
(Indicator 4). 

*Higher percentages of Black students (10 percent) and
Hispanic students (9 percent) reported being threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property than White students
(7 percent) and American Indian/Alaska Native students (6
percent) (Indicator 4).

*In the 2003 04 school year, a greater percentage of teachers
in city schools reported being threatened with injury or
physically attacked than teachers in suburban, town, or rural
schools (Indicator 5). In city schools, 10 percent of
teachers were threatened with injury by students, compared to
6 percent of teachers in suburban schools, 5 percent of
teachers in town schools, and 5 percent of teachers in rural
schools. 

*A greater percentage of secondary school teachers (8
percent) reported being threatened with injury by a student
than elementary school teachers (6 percent) (Indicator 5).
However, a greater percentage of elementary school teachers
(4 percent) reported having been physically attacked than
secondary school teachers (2 percent).

*A greater percentage of public than private school teachers
reported being threatened with injury (7 vs. 2 percent) or
physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent) by students in school
(Indicator 5). Among teachers in city schools, generally,
there were at least five times as many public school teachers
as private school teachers who reported being threatened with
injury (12 vs. 2 percent), and at least four times as many
public school teachers as private school teachers who
reported being physically attacked (5 vs. 1 percent). 

School Environment

*In 2005 06, 86 percent of public schools reported one or
more serious violent incidents,***(Footnote 7 Serious violent
incidents include rape or attempted rape, sexual battery
other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon,
threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or
without a weapon. Serious violent incidents are a subset of
violent incidents).***  violent incidents,***(Footnote 8
Violent incidents include serious violent incidents plus
physical attacks or fights without a weapon and threats of
physical attacks without a weapon. Serious violent incidents
are a subset of violent incidents).***  thefts of items
valued at $10 or greater, or other crimes had occurred at
their school, amounting to an estimated 2.2 million crimes
(Indicator 6). This figure translates into a rate of 46
crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in 2005 06. 

*There was a range in the number of crimes reported by
schools in 2005 06. For example, 46 percent of schools
experienced 20 or more violent incidents, compared to 1
percent of schools that experienced 1 or 2 such incidents and
22 percent of schools that reported zero incidents (Indicator
6).

*In 2005 06, 24 percent of public schools reported that
student bullying was a daily or weekly problem (Indicator 7).
With regard to other discipline problems occurring at least
once a week, 18 percent of public school principals reported
student acts of disrespect for teachers, 9 percent reported
student verbal abuse of teachers, 3 percent reported daily or
weekly occurrences of racial/ethnic tensions among students,
and 2 percent reported widespread disorder in classrooms.
With regard to other discipline problems occurring at least
once per school year, 17 percent of principals reported
undesirable gang activities and 4 percent reported
undesirable cult or extremist activities during 2005 06.  

*In 2005 06, a higher percentage of middle schools than
primary schools reported various types of discipline problems
(Indicator 7). Also, a higher percentage of middle schools
than high schools reported daily or weekly occurrences of
student bullying and student sexual harassment of other
students. 

*In 2007, 23 percent of students ages 12 18 reported that
there were gangs at their schools (Indicator 8). Overall, a
smaller percentage of White students (16 percent) and Asian
students (17 percent) reported a gang presence at school than
Black students (38 percent) and Hispanic students (36
percent). 

*In 2007, 22 percent of all students in grades 9 12 reported
that someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug
on school property in the past 12 months (Indicator 9). 

*Ten percent of students ages 12 18 reported that someone at
school had used hate-related words against them, and more
than one-third (35 percent) reported seeing hate-related
graffiti at school in 2007 (Indicator 10). 

*In 2007, 32 percent of students ages 12 18 reported having
been bullied at school during the school year (Indicator 11).
Twenty-one percent of students said that they had experienced
bullying that consisted of being made fun of; 18 percent
reported being the subject of rumors; 11 percent said that
they were pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; 6 percent said
they were threatened with harm; 5 percent said they were
excluded from activities on purpose; and 4 percent of
students said they were tried to make do things they did not
want to do or that their property was destroyed on purpose. 

*In 2003 04, 35 percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed
that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and
31 percent reported that student tardiness and class cutting
interfered with their teaching (Indicator 12). Seventy-two
percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other
teachers at their school enforced the school rules, and 88
percent reported that the principal enforced the school
rules. 

*A higher percentage of elementary school teachers than
secondary school teachers agreed that school rules were
enforced by teachers in their school, even for students not
in their class (Indicator 12). In 2003 04, 79 percent of
elementary teachers reported that school rules were enforced
by other teachers, compared to 56 percent of secondary
teachers.

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances

*In 2007, 36 percent of students in grades 9 12 reported they
had been in a fight anywhere, and 12 percent said they had
been in a fight on school property during the preceding 12
months (Indicator 13). In the same year, 44 percent of males
said they had been in a fight anywhere, compared to 27
percent of females, and 16 percent of males said they had
been in a fight on school property, compared to 9 percent of
females. 

*Eighteen percent of students in grades 9 12 in 2007 reported
they had carried a weapon ***(Footnote 9 Such as a gun,
knife, or club).*** anywhere, and 6 percent reported they had
carried a weapon on school property during the previous 30
days (Indicator 14). There were at least three times as many
males as females who reported carrying a weapon either
anywhere or on school property in all survey years. In 2007,
for example, 9 percent of males carried a weapon on school
property, compared to 3 percent of females, and 29 percent of
males carried a weapon anywhere, compared to 7 percent of
females.

*In 2007, 45 percent of students in grades 9 12 reported
having consumed at least one drink of alcohol anywhere, and 4
percent reported having consumed at least one drink on school
property during the previous 30 days (Indicator 15). 

*Twenty percent of students in grades 9 12 in 2007 reported
using marijuana anywhere during the past 30 days, and 4
percent reported using marijuana on school property during
this period (Indicator 16). 

Fear and Avoidance


*In 2007, approximately 5 percent of students ages 12 18
reported that they were afraid of attack or harm at school,
and 3 percent reported that they were afraid of attack or
harm away from school (Indicator 17). In 2007, smaller
percentages of White students (4 percent) and Asian students
(2 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm at school
than their Black (9 percent) and Hispanic (7 percent) peers.

*In 2007, 7 percent of students ages 12 18 reported that they
had avoided a school activity or one or more places in school
in the previous 6 months because of fear of attack or harm: 3
percent of students avoided a school activity, and 6 percent
avoided one or more places in school (Indicator 18). 

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures

*Forty-eight percent of public schools reported taking at
least one serious disciplinary action against a
student including suspensions lasting 5 days or more,
removals with no services (i.e., expulsions), and transfers
to specialized schools for specific offenses during the
2005 06 school year (Indicator 19). Of those serious
disciplinary actions, 74 percent were suspensions for 5 days
or more, 5 percent were expulsions, and 20 percent were
transfers to specialized schools. 

*In the 2005 06 school year, 5 percent of public schools
reported performing drug testing on athletes and 3 percent
reported doing so for students in other extracurricular
activities (Indicator 20). A higher percentage of public high
schools than middle or primary schools reported performing
drug tests on students: 13 percent of high schools reported
performing drug tests on athletes, compared to 7 percent of
middle schools and 1 percent of primary schools. 

*The majority of students ages 12 18 reported that their
school had a student code of conduct (96 percent) and a
requirement that visitors sign in (94 percent) in 2007
(Indicator 21). Metal detectors were the least commonly
observed security measure. Ten percent of students reported
the use of metal detectors at their school.

INTRODUCTION

Our nation's schools should be safe havens for teaching and
learning free of crime and violence. Even though a smaller
percentage of students are victims of a serious violent crime
at school ***(Footnote 1 See appendix B for a detailed
definition of "at school").*** than away from school
(Indicators 1 and 2), any instance of crime or violence at
school not only affects the individuals involved but also may
disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the
school itself, and the surrounding community (Henry 2000).
For both students and teachers, victimization at school can
have lasting effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness,
depression, and adjustment difficulties (Crick and Bigbee
1998; Crick and Grotpeter 1996; Nansel et al. 2001;
Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001; Storch et al. 2003),
victimized children are more prone to truancy (Ringwalt,
Ennett, and Johnson 2003), poor academic performance (Wei and
Williams 2004; MacMillan and Hagan 2004), dropping out of
school (Beauvais et al. 1996; MacMillan and Hagan 2004), and
violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003). For teachers,
incidents of victimization may lead to professional
disenchantment and even departure from the profession
altogether (Karcher 2002; Smith and Smith 2006).

For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively
address school crime, they need an accurate understanding of
the extent, nature, and context of the problem. However, it
is difficult to gauge the scope of crime and violence in
schools given the large amount of attention devoted to
isolated incidents of extreme school violence. Measuring
progress toward safer schools requires establishing good
indicators of the current state of school crime and safety
across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these
indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and
Safety. 

Purpose and Organization of This Report

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2008 is the eleventh
in a series of reports produced since 1998 by the National
Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS) that present the most recent data
available on school crime and student safety. The report is
not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school crime
and safety information, nor does it attempt to explore
reasons for crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is
designed to provide a brief summary of information from an
array of data sources and to make data on national school
crime and safety accessible to policymakers, educators,
parents, and the general public.

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2008 is organized into
sections that delineate specific concerns to readers,
starting with a description of the most serious violent
crimes. The sections cover Violent Deaths; Nonfatal Student
and Teacher Victimization; School Environment; Fights,
Weapons, and Illegal Substances; Fear and Avoidance; and
Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures. Each section
contains a set of indicators that, taken together, aim to
describe a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where
available, data on crimes that occur outside of school
grounds are offered as a point of comparison. ***(Footnote 2
Data in this report are not adjusted to reflect the number of
hours that youths spend on school property versus the number
of hours they spend elsewhere).***   Supplemental tables for
each indicator provide more detailed breakouts and standard
errors for estimates. A glossary of terms and a reference
section appear at the end of the report. Standard errors for
the estimate tables are available online.

This year's report contains updated data for 15 indicators:
violent deaths (Indicator 1), nonfatal student victimization
(Indicator 2), the prevalence of victimization at school
(Indicator 3), threats and injuries with weapons on school
property (Indicator 4), students' reports of gangs at school
(Indicator 8), students' reports of drug availability on
school property (Indicator 9), students' reports of being
called hate-related words and seeing hate-related graffiti
(Indicator 10), bullying at school and cyber-bullying
anywhere (Indicator 11), physical fights on school property
and anywhere (Indicator 13), students carrying weapons on
school property and anywhere (Indicator 14), students' use of
alcohol on school property and anywhere (Indicator 15),
students' use of marijuana on school property and anywhere
(Indicator 16), students' perceptions of personal safety at
school and away from school (Indicator 17), students' reports
of avoiding school activities or specific places in school
(Indicator 18), and students' reports of safety and security
measures observed at school (Indicator 21). In addition, two
new tables on violent and other crime incidents at school and
those reported to the police by the number of incidents have
been added to Indicator 6.

Also found in this year's report are references to recent
publications relevant to each indicator that the reader may
want to consult for additional information or analyses. These
references can be found in the "For more information"
sidebars at the bottom of each indicator. 

Data

The indicators in this report are based on information drawn
from a variety of independent data sources, including
national surveys of students, teachers, and principals and
universe data collections from federal departments and
agencies, including BJS, NCES, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample
design, data collection method, and questionnaire design or
is the result of a universe data collection. 

The combination of multiple, independent sources of data
provides a broad perspective on school crime and safety that
could not be achieved through any single source of
information. However, readers should be cautious when
comparing data from different sources. While every effort has
been made to keep key definitions consistent across
indicators, differences in sampling procedures, populations,
time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the
comparability of results. For example, both Indicators 20 and
21 report data on select security and safety measures used in
schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected from a survey of
principals about safety and security practices used in their
schools during the 2005 06 school year. Indicator 21,
however, uses data collected from 12- through 18-year-olds
residing in a sample of households. These students were asked
whether they observed selected safety and security measures
in their school in 2007, but they may not have known whether,
in fact, the security measure was present. In addition,
different indicators contain various approaches to the
analysis of school crime data and, therefore, will show
different perspectives on school crime. For example, both
Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent crime at
school based on the National Crime Victimization Survey and
the School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively.
While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents of crime,
Indicator 3 examines the percentage or prevalence of students
who reported victimization. Figure A provides a summary of
some of the variations in the design and coverage of sample
surveys used in this report.

Several indicators in this report are based on self-reported
survey data. Readers should note that limitations inherent to
self-reported data may affect estimates (Cantor and Lynch
2000; Addington 2005). First, unless an interview is
"bounded" or a reference period is established, estimates may
include events that exceed the scope of the specified
reference period. This factor may artificially increase
reported incidents because respondents may recall events
outside of the given reference period. Second, many of the
surveys rely on the respondent to "self-determine" a
condition. This factor allows the respondent to define a
situation based upon his or her own interpretation of whether
the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand, the same
situation may not necessarily be interpreted in the same way
by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim
surveys tend to emphasize crime events as incidents that take
place at one point in time. However, victims can often
experience a state of victimization in which they are
threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally,
respondents may recall an event inaccurately. For instance,
people may forget the event entirely or recall the specifics
of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors may
affect the precision of the estimates based on these surveys.

Data trends are discussed in this report when possible. Where
trends are not discussed, either the data are not available
in earlier surveys or the wording of the survey question
changed from year to year, eliminating the ability to discuss
any trend. For example, in Indicator 11, which reports on
bullying using data from the School Crime Supplement survey,
the 2007 questionnaire was revised to include information on
cyber-bullying. Due to this change, the text of this
indicator is no longer presenting trend information. For
Indicator 2, due to changes in survey methodology in the 2006
National Crime Victimization Survey that mainly affected
rural areas, national-level estimates were not comparable to
estimates based on data from previous years. For Indicators
3, 8, 10, 17, and 18, due to changes in survey methodology in
the 2007 School Crime Supplement data file that mainly
affected rural areas, estimates for urbanicity were
suppressed on the data file. For more information on the
National Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime
Supplement, please see appendix A.

Where data from samples are reported, as is the case with
most of the indicators in this report, the standard error is
calculated for each estimate provided in order to determine
the "margin of error" for these estimates. The standard
errors of the estimates for different subpopulations in an
indicator can vary considerably and should be taken into
account when making comparisons. Throughout this report, in
cases where the standard error was at least 30 percent of the
associated estimate, the estimates were noted with a "!"
symbol (interpret data with caution). In cases where the
standard error was greater than 50 percent of the associated
estimate, the estimate was suppressed. See appendix A for
more information.

The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical
significance to ensure that the differences are larger than
might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless otherwise
noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically
significant at the .05 level. Several test procedures were
used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the
nature of the statement being tested. The primary test
procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic,
which tests the difference between two sample estimates.
Linear trend tests were used when differences among
percentages were examined relative to interval categories of
a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete
categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for
example, the percentage of students who reported using drugs
increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage
of students who reported being physically attacked in school
increased (or decreased) with age. When differences among
percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordinal
categories (such as grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
used to test for a linear relationship between the two
variables.

Although percentages reported in the tables are generally
rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent),
percentages reported in the text and figures are generally
rounded from the original number to whole numbers (with any
value of 0.50 or above rounded to the next highest whole
number). While the data labels on the figures have been
rounded to whole numbers, the graphical presentation of these
data is based on the unrounded estimates shown in the
corresponding table.

Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the
datasets used in this report and a discussion of how standard
errors were calculated for each estimate.

VIOLENT DEATHS

Indicator 1 
Violent Deaths at School and Away From School

The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school
remained at less than 2 percent of the total number of youth
homicides over all available survey years even though the
absolute number of homicides of school-age youth at school
varied to some degree across the years.

Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events with
far-reaching effects on the school population and surrounding
community. From July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007, there
were 55 school-associated violent deaths in elementary and
secondary schools in the United States (tables 1.1 and
1.2).***(Footnote 3 Between July 1, 2006, and June 30, 2007,
there were 55 student, staff, and nonstudent
school-associated violent deaths, including 40 homicides, 12
suicides, 2 legal interventions, and 1 unintentional
firearm-related death (table 1.2).*** In this indicator, a
school-associated violent death is defined as "a homicide,
suicide, legal intervention (involving a law enforcement
officer), or unintentional firearm-related death in which the
fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning
elementary or secondary school in the United States." Victims
of school-associated violent deaths include students, staff
members, and others who are not students. School-associated
violent deaths include violent deaths that occurred while the
victim was on the way to or returning from regular sessions
at school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to
or from an official school-sponsored event. At-school and
away-from-school homicide and suicide data were drawn from a
number of sources. Data for school-associated violent deaths
for the 2006 07 school year are preliminary. Data for total
suicides are available for 2005 and total homicides are
available for 2005 06.***(Footnote 4 Data on total suicides
are available only by calendar year, whereas data on suicides
and homicides at school and total homicides are available by
school year. Due to these differences in reference periods,
please use caution when comparing violent deaths at school to
total violent deaths. Data for total suicides (2006) and
total homicides (2006 2007) are not yet available.*** 


The most recent data available for the total number of
homicides of school-age youth are from the 2005 06 school
year (figure 1.1 and table 1.1), during which there were
1,646 homicides. In the 2005 calendar year, there were 1,408
suicides of school-age youth. From July 1, 2006, through June
30, 2007, there were 27 homicides and 8 suicides of
school-age youth (ages 5 18) at school (figure 1.2 and table
1.1). In each year during the period 1992 93 to 2005 06,
there were generally at least 50 times as many murders of
youth away from school than at school and generally at least
140 times as many suicides of youth away from school than at
school.4 During the 2006 07 school year, there were
approximately one homicide or suicide of a school-age youth
at school per 1.6 million students enrolled.***(Footnote 5
The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten
through 12th grade during the 2006 07 school year was
55,394,000 (U.S. Department of Education 2009).***

Between July 1, 1992, and June 30, 1999, no consistent
pattern of increase or decrease was observed in the number of
homicides at school (figure 1.2 and table 1.1). During this
period, between 28 and 34 homicides of school-age youth
occurred at school in each school year. The number of
homicides of school-age youth at school was lower during the
1999 2000 school year than during the 1998 1999 school year
(13 vs. 33 homicides). The number of homicides of school-age
youth at school increased from 14 to 22 between the 2000 01
and 2003 04 school years, and then declined to 19 by the
2005 06 school year. In 2006 07, the number of homicides of
school-age youth was 27. The percentage of youth homicides
occurring at school remained at less than 2 percent of the
total number of youth homicides over all available survey
years even though the absolute number of homicides of
school-age youth at school varied to some degree across the
years. Between the 1992 93 and 2006 07 school years, from 1
to 9 school-age youth committed suicide at school each year,
with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease in the
number of suicides.

Indicator 2
Incidence of Victimization at School and Away From School

In 2006, the rate for serious violent crime was lower at
school than away from school, while the rate for theft was
higher at school than away from school. There was no
measurable difference between the victimization rates for
violent crime at school and away from school.

Theft and violence both at school and while going to and from
school can lead to a disruptive and threatening environment,
physical injury, emotional stress, and can be an obstacle to
student achievement (MacMillan and Hagan 2004; Elliot,
Hamburg, and Williams 1998). In 2006, data from the National
Crime Victimization Survey ***(Footnote 6 Although Indicators
2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey
sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time
coverage and administration. For more information on these
two surveys, please see appendix A).***showed that students
ages 12 18 were victims of about 1.7 million nonfatal crimes
(theft ***(Footnote 7 Theft includes purse snatching, pick
pocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all
attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts.
Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of
force is involved).*** plus violent crime. ***(Footnote 8
Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple
assault.*** ) while they were at school ***(Footnote 9 "At
school" includes inside the school building, on school
property, or on the way to or from school).*** and about 1.3
million nonfatal crimes while they were away from school in
2006 (table 2.1).***(Footnote 10 Due to changes in survey
methodology in 2006 that mainly affected rural areas, 2006
estimates are not comparable to estimates based on NCVS data
from previous years. For more information, please see
appendix A).***,***(Footnote 11 "Students" refers to youth
ages 12 18 whose educational attainment did not exceed grade
12 at the time of the survey. An uncertain percentage of
these persons may not have attended school during the survey
reference period. These data do not take into account the
number of hours that students spend at school or away from
school).*** These figures represent total crime victimization
rates of 63 crimes per 1,000 students at school, and 49
crimes per 1,000 students away from school (table 2.1).

In 2006, students were victims of 909,500 crimes of theft at
school and 659,400 crimes of theft away from school. This
translates into 34 thefts per 1,000 students at school,
compared to 25 thefts per 1,000 students away from school.
There was no measurable difference between the victimization
rates for violent crime at school and away from school. At
school there were 29 violent crimes per 1,000 students. Away
from school, there were 24 violent crimes per 1,000 students.
The rate for serious violent crime ***(Footnote 12 Serious
violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
aggravated assault).*** was lower at school than away from
school in 2006. Students age 12 18 were victims of 6 serious
violent crimes per 1,000 students at school, compared to 11
serious violent crimes per 1,000 students away from school.

The victimization rates for students ages 12 18 varied
according to certain student characteristics in 2006. A
greater rate of older students (ages 15 18) than younger
students (ages 12 14) were victims of crime away from school
(figures 2.1 and 2.2 and tables 2.2 and 2.3). No measurable
difference was found by age when it came to victimization at
school. 

Students living in households with incomes of $75,000 or more
had a lower rate of total crime victimization at school than
students living in households with incomes of $49,999 or
less. They also had a lower rate of total crime victimization
away from school than students living in households with
incomes of $74,999 or less. Though there was generally no
measurable difference between students living in households
with different income levels when it came to rates of theft
at or away from school, significant differences were seen
when looking at violent crime experienced at or away from
school. Students living in households with incomes of $75,000
or more had a lower rate of violent crime victimization at
school and away from school than students living in
households with incomes of $49,999 or less.

(2007); and MacMillan and Hagan (2004).
-----------------------------------------------------------

Indicator 3
Prevalence of Victimization at School

In 2007, 4 percent of students ages 12 18 reported being
victimized at school during the previous 6 months. About 3
percent of students reported theft, 2 percent reported
violent victimization, and less than half of a percent
reported serious violent victimization.

Theft is the most frequent type of nonfatal victimization in
the United States (U.S. Department of Justice 2007). Data
from the School Crime Supplement ***(Footnote 13 In 2005 and
2007, the unit response rate for the SCS survey did not meet
NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data
with caution. For more information, please see appendix A).***
,***(Footnote 14 Although Indicators 2 and 3 present
information on similar topics, the survey sources for these
two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and

please see appendix A).*** show the percentage of students
ages 12 18 who reported criminal victimization at school
***(Footnote 15 "At school" includes the school building, on
school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward,
going to and from school).*** during the previous 6 months. In
2007, 4 percent of students ages 12 18 reported being
victimized at school during the previous 6 months. About 3
percent of students reported theft,***(Footnote 16 Theft
includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all burglaries,
attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed
thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include
robbery in which threat or use of force is involved.***
 2 percent reported violent victimization ***(Footnote 17
Violent victimization includes serious violent crimes and
simple assault).*** (figure 3.1 and table 3.1), and less than
half of a percent reported serious violent victimization.
***(Footnote 18 Serious violent victimization includes rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault).***

In 2007, the prevalence of victimization varied somewhat
according to student characteristics. For all types of
victimization, no measurable differences were detected by sex
in the likelihood of reporting victimization. The percentage
of students reporting victimization was higher for students
in the 7th or 9th grade than for students in the 12th grade;
however, no other measurable differences in the percentages
reporting victimization were found across grades. In 2007, no
measurable differences were detected in the percentages of
White, Black, or Hispanic students who reported
victimization, theft, or violent victimization. However, a
higher percentage of students of other races/ethnicities than
Hispanic students reported victimization, and a higher
percentage of students of other races/ethnicities than White
or Hispanic students reported violent victimization. 

Some differences were also seen by school sector in the
prevalence of victimization reported in 2007. A higher
percentage of students in public schools reported
victimization (5 percent) and theft (3 percent) than students
in private schools (1 percent each).

Overall, the percentage of students ages 12 18 who were
victimized at school decreased between 1995 and 2005 from 10
to 4 percent. For each type of victimization, the percentage
of students reporting victimization decreased between 1995
and 2005. Between the most recent survey years (2005 and
2007), there were no measurable changes in the percentage of
students reporting any type of victimization.

This indicator has been updated to include 2007 data. For
more information: Tables 3.1 and Bauer et al. (2008).
--------------------------------------------------------

Indicator 4
Threats and Injuries With Weapons on School Property

The percentage of students who were threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property has fluctuated between 7 
and 9 percent in all survey years from 1993 through 2007. 

Every year, some students are threatened or injured with a
weapon while they are on school property.***(Footnote 19 "On
school property" was not defined for survey respondents).***
The percentage of students victimized in this way provides
an important measure of how safe our schools are, and how
school safety has changed over time. In the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, students in grades 9 12 were asked whether
they had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property during the 12 months preceding the survey. In 2007,
8 percent of students reported being threatened or injured
with a weapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, on school
property (table 4.1). From 1993 through 2007, the percentage
of students who were threatened or injured with a weapon
fluctuated between 7 and 9 percent.

The likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon
on school property varied by student characteristics,
including sex and grade level. In each survey year, a higher
percentage of males than females reported being threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property (figure 4.1 and
table 4.1). In 2007, the percentage of male students who
reported being threatened or injured in the past year was
nearly twice as high as the percentage of female students (10
vs. 5 percent). Generally, the percentages of 9th- and
10th-graders who reported being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property were higher than the percentages of
11th- and 12th-graders (figure 4.2 and table 4.1). 

For example, in 2007, 9 percent of 9th-graders and 8 percent
of 10th-graders reported that they were threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property, compared with 7 percent of
11th-graders and 6 percent of 12th-graders. 

The percentage of students who reported being threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property varied by
race/ethnicity in 2007. Higher percentages of students of
more than one race (13 percent), Black students (10 percent),
and Hispanic students (9 percent) reported being threatened
or injured with a weapon on school property than White
students (7 percent). Higher percentages of all of these
groups, except for White students, also reported being
threatened or injured with a weapon on school property than
did American Indian/Alaska Native students (6 percent).
However, no other measurable differences were found by
race/ethnicity in the percentages of students who reported
being threatened or injured in this way. 

In 2007, student reports of being threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property varied among the 39 states and
the District of Columbia for which data were available. Among
these states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of
students who reported being threatened or injured on school
property ranged from 5 percent in Massachusetts and North
Dakota to 11 percent in Arizona, the District of Columbia,
and Utah (table 4.2).\

---------------------------------------------------------

Indicator 5
Teachers Threatened With Injury or Physically Attacked by
Students

In the 2003 04 school year, a greater percentage of public
school teachers in city schools than their peers in suburban,
town, or rural schools reported being threatened with injury
or physically attacked. 

Students are not the only victims of intimidation or violence
in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats and physical
attacks, and students from their schools sometimes commit
these offenses. In the Schools and Staffing Survey, teachers
were asked whether they had been threatened with injury or
physically attacked by a student from their school in the
previous 12 months. A smaller percentage of teachers, 7
percent, were threatened with injury by a student from their
school in the 2003 04 school year than in 1993 94 and
1999 2000 school years, 12 and 9 percent respectively (figure
5.1 and table 5.1). A smaller percentage of teachers reported
being physically attacked in 2003 04, 3 percent, than in
1993 94, 4 percent (table 5.2). 

A greater percentage of teachers in city schools reported
being threatened with injury or physically attacked in
2003 04 than teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools
(figure 5.2 and tables 5.1 and 5.2). For example, in 2003 04,
10 percent of teachers in city schools were threatened with
injury by students, compared to 6 percent of teachers in
suburban schools, 5 percent of teachers in town schools, and
5 percent of teachers in rural schools. Five percent of
teachers in city schools were physically attacked by
students, compared to 3 percent of teachers in suburban
schools, 3 percent of teachers in town schools, and 2 percent
of teachers in rural schools. A greater percentage of
teachers in suburban schools reported being threatened with
injury or physically attacked than teachers in rural schools. 

In the 2003 04 school year, teachers' reports of being
threatened or physically attacked by students varied
according to the level of their school. A greater percentage
of secondary school teachers, 8 percent, reported being
threatened with injury by a student than elementary school
teachers, 6 percent (table 5.1). However, a greater
percentage of elementary school teachers, 4 percent, reported
having been physically attacked than secondary school
teachers, 2 percent (table 5.2). Generally, a greater
percentage of elementary and secondary teachers in city
schools reported being threatened with injury or physically
attacked than elementary or secondary teachers in suburban,
town, or rural schools (figure 5.2). For example, in the
2003 04 school year, 12 percent of secondary teachers in city
schools reported being threatened with injury compared to 7
percent of secondary suburban school teachers, and 6 percent
of town and rural secondary school teachers. 

A greater percentage of public than private school teachers
reported being threatened with injury (7 vs. 2 percent) or
physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent) by students in school
(tables 5.1 and 5.2). Among teachers in city schools,
generally, there were at least five times as many public
school teachers as private school teachers who reported being
threatened with injury (12 vs. 2 percent) and at least four
times as many public school teachers as private school
teachers who reported being physically attacked (5 vs. 1
percent).

Public school teachers' reports of being threatened with
injury or physically attacked varied among states. In
2003 04, the percentage of public school teachers who
reported being threatened in the previous 12 months ranged
from 4 to 18 percent (table 5.3), and the percentage who were
physically attacked ranged from 1 to 7 percent (table 5.4). 

This indicator repeats information from the 2007 Indicators
of School Crime and Safety report. For more information:

Indicator 6
Violent and Other Crime Incidents at Public Schools and Those
Reported to the Police

In 2005 06, 78 percent of public schools experienced one or
more violent incidents of crime, 17 percent experienced one
or more serious violent incidents, 46 percent experienced one
or more thefts, and 68 percent experienced another type of
crime. 

This indicator presents the percentage of public schools that
experienced one or more specified crimes, the total number of
these crimes reported by schools, and the rate of crimes per
1,000 students. These data are also presented for the crimes
that were reported to the police. In the School Survey on
Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked to
provide the number of serious violent incidents,***(Footnote
18 Serious violent incidents include rape or attempted rape,
sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with
a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and
robbery with or without a weapon).***  violent  incidents,
***(Footnote 19 Violent incidents include serious violent
incidents plus physical attacks or fights without a weapon
and threats of physical attacks without a weapon.***  thefts
of items valued at $10 or greater without personal
confrontation, and other incidents.) ***(Footnote 20 Other
incidents include possession of a firearm or explosive
device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution,
possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; and
vandalism).*** that occurred at their school,)***(Footnote 21
"At school" was defined for respondents to include activities
that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school
buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or
activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents
that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or
when school activities or events were in session).*** as well 
as the number of these incidents reported to the police.
During the 2005 06 school year, 86 percent of public schools
reported that one or more incidents of these crimes had taken
place, amounting to an estimated 2.2 million crimes (figure
6.1 and table 6.1). This figure translates into a rate of 46
crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in 2005 06. During the
same year, 61 percent of schools reported an incident of one
of the specified crimes to the police, amounting to about
763,000 crimes or 16 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled. 


In 2005 06, 78 percent of schools experienced one or more
violent incidents of crime, 17 percent experienced one or
more serious violent incidents, 46 percent experienced one or
more thefts, and 68 percent experienced one or more other
incidents. Thirty-eight percent of public schools reported at
least one violent incident to police, 13 percent reported at
least one serious violent incident to police, 28 percent
reported at least one theft to police, and 51 percent
reported one or more of the other incidents to police. 

The percentage of public schools with incidents of crime was
lower in 2005 06 than in 2003 04. In 2003 04, 89 percent of
schools experienced crimes, compared to 86 percent of schools
in 2005 06 (figure 6.3 and table 6.1). The percentage of
schools with crimes in 2005 06 was not measurably different
from the percentage of schools with crimes in 1999 2000. The
percentage of public schools that reported crimes to the
police followed a similar pattern. In 1999 2000, 62 percent
of schools reported crimes to the police; in 2003 04, 65
percent of schools reported crimes to the police; and, in
2005 06, 61 percent of schools did so. 

There was a range in the number of crimes reported by schools
in 2005 06. For example, 46 percent of schools experienced 20
or more violent incidents compared to 1 percent that
experienced 1 or 2 such incidents and 22 percent that
reported zero incidents (figure 6.2 and table 6.4). Although
83 percent of schools reported zero incidents of serious
violent crime, about 2 percent experienced 1 serious violent
incident, 4 percent experienced 2 serious violent incidents,
6 percent experienced 3 to 5 serious violent incidents, 2
percent experienced 6 to 9 serious violent incidents, and 3
percent experienced 10 or more such incidents (figure 6.2 and
table 6.5). Similarly, there also was a substantial range in
the number of incidents reported to the police. For example,
62 percent of schools reported zero incidents of violent
crime to the police compared to 5 percent that reported 1 or
2 violent incidents and 9 percent that reported 20 or more
such incidents (figure 6.2 and table 6.4).  

The percentage of schools that experienced violent crime also
varied by school characteristic and number of incidents. A
larger percentage of city schools (53 percent) reported 20 or
more violent incidents than urban fringe schools (42 percent)
and rural schools (43 percent). There was no measurable
difference in the percentage of city schools and town schools
that experienced 20 or more violent incidents in 2005 06. 

As the percentage of students eligible for free or
reduced-price lunch increased, so did the percentage of
schools reporting experiencing 20 or more violent incidents.
In 2005 06, 55 percent of schools where more than 50 percent
of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch
experienced 20 or more violent incidents compared to 29
percent of schools where 20 percent or less of the students
were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch. The percentage
of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch programs
is a proxy measure of school poverty.

This indicator has been modified. For more information:

definitions of school levels and urbanicity; and Nolle,

------------------------------------------------------

Indicator 7
Discipline Problems Reported by Public Schools

Between 1999 2000 and 2005 06, the percentage of principals
reporting student bullying as a frequently occurring
discipline problem declined from 29 to 24 percent and student
verbal abuse of teachers declined from 13 to 9 percent. 

The existence of discipline problems in a school may
contribute to an environment that facilitates school violence
and crime. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, school
principals were asked how often certain disciplinary problems
happen in their schools.***(Footnote 22 "At school" was
defined for respondents to include activities that happen in
school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at
places that hold school-sponsored events or activities.
Respondents were instructed to include incidents that
occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when
school activities or events were in session).***    This
indicator examines the daily or weekly occurrence of student
racial tensions, bullying, sexual harassment of other
students, verbal abuse of teachers, widespread classroom
disorder, and acts of disrespect for teachers in public
schools. It also looks at occurrences of undesirable gang and
cult activities, and due to the severe nature of these
incidents, presents all reports of gang and cult activities
during the school year. 

Twenty-four percent of public schools reported that bullying
occurred among students on a daily or weekly basis and 18
percent reported that student acts of disrespect for teachers
took place on a daily or weekly basis during the 2005 06
school year (figure 7.1 and table 7.1). With regard to other
frequently occurring discipline problems in public schools
(those occurring at least once a week), 9 percent of
principals reported student verbal abuse of teachers, 3
percent reported student sexual harassment of other students,
3 percent reported student racial/ethnic tensions, and 2
percent reported widespread disorder in classrooms. Seventeen
percent of public schools reported that undesirable gang
activities and 4 percent reported that undesirable cult or
extremist activities had happened at all during 2005 06. The
percentage of principals reporting that student bullying and
student verbal abuse of teachers occurred at least once a
week declined between 1999 2000 and 2005 06 (table 7.1).
During this period, the percentage of principals reporting
student bullying as a frequently occurring discipline problem
declined from 29 to 24 percent and student verbal abuse of
teachers declined from 13 to 9 percent. 

Discipline problems reported by public schools varied by
school characteristics in 2005 06. In general, the percentage
of principals reporting discipline problems was higher in
large schools than in small schools (figure 7.1 and table
7.2). For example, 35 percent of principals at schools with
1,000 or more students reported that student acts of
disrespect for teachers occurred at least once a week,
whereas 12 percent at schools with less than 300 students
reported this discipline problem. Also, in 2005 06, a higher
percentage of middle schools than primary schools reported
various types of discipline problems. Also, a higher
percentage of middle schools than high schools reported daily
or weekly occurrences of student bullying and student sexual
harassment of other students. 

In 2005 06, the percentage of schools reporting the
discipline problems of widespread disorder in the classroom,
student acts of disrespect for teachers, student verbal abuse
of teachers, and undesirable gang activities was generally
smaller for schools where 20 percent or fewer of the students
were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch than for
schools where more than 50 percent of the students were
eligible (table 7.2). For example, 14 percent of schools
where more than 50 percent of the students were eligible for
free or reduced-price lunch reported the daily or weekly
occurrence of student verbal abuse of teachers compared to 3
percent of schools where 20 percent or fewer of the students
were eligible. The percentage of students eligible for free
or reduced-price lunch programs is a proxy measure of school
poverty.

Indicator 8
Students' Reports of Gangs at School

In 2007, about 23 percent of students reported that gangs
were present at their school. 

Gangs are organized groups often involved in drugs, weapons
trafficking, and violence. Gangs at school can be disruptive
to the school environment because their presence may incite
fear among students and increase the level of school violence
(Laub and Lauritsen 1998). In the School Crime Supplement
***(Footnote 23 In 2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for
this survey did not meet NCES statistical standards;
therefore, interpret the data with caution. In 2007, the
reference period was the school year, whereas in prior survey
years the reference period was the previous 6 months.
Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 are
comparable to previous years. For more information, please
see appendix A).*** to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 
students ages 12 18 were asked if gangs were present at their  
school. ***(Footnote 24 "At school" includes the school building, 
on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from
school).*** 

In 2007, 23 percent of students reported that there were
gangs at their schools during the school year (figure 8.1 and
table 8.1). During the same year, a greater percentage of
male students (25 percent) than female students (21 percent)
reported a gang presence at their schools. Overall, a smaller
percentage of White students (16 percent) and Asian students
(17 percent) reported a gang presence at school than Black
students (38 percent) and Hispanic students (36 percent) in
2007. 

Generally, a smaller percentage of 6th-, 7th-, and
8th-graders reported a gang presence at their school than
9th-, 10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders. In 2007, between 15 and
21 percent of 6th-, 7th-, and 8th-graders reported a gang
presence at school compared to 24 to 28 percent of students
in the higher grades. In 2007, a higher percentage of
students attending public schools (25 percent) reported a
gang presence at school than students attending private
schools (5 percent). 

The total percentage of students who reported the presence of
gangs at school was higher in 2005 (24 percent) than in 2003
(21 percent); however there was no measurable change in the
percentage of students who reported the presence of gangs at
school between the two most recent survey years (2005 and
2007) (figure 8.2 and table 8.1).

Indicator 9
Students' Reports of Drug Availability on School Property

A smaller percentage of students reported that drugs were
offered, sold, or given to them at school in 2007 (22
percent) than in 2005 (25 percent).

The availability of drugs on school property has a disruptive
and corrupting influence on the school environment (Nolin et
al. 1997). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in
grades 9 12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or
given them an illegal drug on school property in the 12
months before the survey. ***(Footnote 25 "On school
property" was not defined for survey respondents).*** The
percentage of students in grades 9 12 who reported that drugs
were made available to them on school property increased from
1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 percent), but subsequently
decreased (to 25 percent in 2005 and 22 percent in 2007)
(table 9.1 and figure 9.1). The percentage of students in
grades 9 12 who reported that drugs were made available to
them on school property was lower in 2007 than it was in 2005
(22 vs. 25 percent).

Reports of the availability of drugs on school property
varied by student characteristics. A higher percentage of
males than females reported that drugs were offered, sold, or
given to them on school property in each survey year from
1993 to 2007 (figure 9.1 and table 9.1). For example, in
2007, 26 percent of males reported that drugs were available,
compared with 19 percent of females. Some differences in the
percentages of students reporting that drugs were offered,
sold, or given to them on school property also appeared by
grade. In 2007, the percentage of 10th-grade students (25
percent) who reported that drugs were made available to them
was higher than the percentage for either 9th- or 12th-grade
students (21 and 20 percent, respectively), but not
measurably different from that of 11th-grade students. 

The percentages of students who reported having illegal drugs
offered, sold, or given to them on school property differed
across racial/ethnic groups (figure 9.2 and table 9.1).
Specifically, in 2007, higher percentages of Hispanic and
Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students than Black, White,
and Asian students reported that drugs were made available to
them (29 and 38 percent vs. 19 21 percent). Although it
appears that a higher percentage of Pacific Islander/Native
Hawaiian students than Hispanic students reported that drugs
were made available to them, the difference was not found to
be statistically significant.

In 2007, student reports of the availability of drugs on
school property varied among the 39 states and the District
of Columbia for which data were available. Among these states
and the District of Columbia, the percentage of students
reporting that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on
school property ranged from 10 percent in Iowa to 37 percent
in Arizona (table 9.2).

Indicator 10
Students' Reports of Being Called Hate-Related Words and
Seeing Hate-Related Graffiti

In 2007, 10 percent of students ages 12 18 reported that
someone at school had used hate-related words against them,
and 35 percent had seen hate-related graffiti at school. 

In the 2007 School Crime Supplement ***(Footnote 26 In 2005
and 2007, the unit response rate for this survey did not meet
NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the data
with caution. In 2007, the reference period was the school
year, whereas in prior survey years the reference period was
the previous 6 months. Cognitive testing showed that
estimates from 2007 are comparable to previous years. For
more information, please see appendix A). *** to the National
Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12 18 were asked if
someone at school had called them a derogatory word having to
do with their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender,
or sexual orientation at school. ***(Footnote 27 "At school"
includes the school building, on school property, on a school
bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school).***
 Students were also asked if they had seen hate-related
graffiti at their school that is, hate-related words or
symbols written in classrooms, bathrooms, hallways, or on the
outside of the school building. With regard to hate-related
words, students were asked to specify the characteristic to
which the word was directed.***(Footnote 28 "Hate-related"
refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to
students' personal characteristics).*** In 2007, 10 percent of
students ages 12 18 reported that someone at school had used
hate-related words against them during the school year
(figure 10.1 and table 10.1). Thirty-five percent of students
reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the
school year. 

In 2007, students' experiences of being called specific types
of hate-related words and seeing hate-related graffiti
differed according to student and school characteristics. For
example, a smaller percentage of 12th-graders (6 percent)
reported being targets of a hate-related word than
6th-graders (12 percent); 7th-graders, 8th-graders, and
9th-graders (11 percent each); and 10th-graders (9 percent).
A higher percentage of public school students reported being
called a hate-related word and seeing hate-related graffiti
than did private school students. In 2007, 10 percent of
public school students reported being called a hate-related
word and 36 percent reported seeing hate-related graffiti
compared to 6 percent of private school students who reported
being called a hate-related word and 19 percent who reported
seeing hate-related graffiti. A higher percentage of White
students and students of other races/ethnicities than Asian
students reported seeing hate-related graffiti. However, no
other measurable differences were found by race/ethnicity or
by sex in the percentages of students who reported being
called hate-related words or seeing hate-related graffiti.

Between 2001 and 2007, the percentage of students who
reported being the target of a hate-related word decreased
from 12 to 10 percent. Between the two most recent survey
years, 2005 and 2007, the percentage of students who reported
being the target of a hate-related word was lower in 2007 (10
percent) than in 2005 (11 percent). There was no pattern of
increase or decrease in the percentage of students who
reported seeing hate-related graffiti between 1999 and 2007.
However, the percentage of students who reported seeing
hate-related graffiti was smaller in 2007 (35 percent) than
in 2005 (38 percent).

With regard to the specific characteristic to which the
hate-related word was directed, in 2007, 5 percent of
students reported hate-related words concerning their race, 3
percent reported words related to their ethnicity, 2 percent
each reported words concerning their religion or gender, and
1 percent each reported words related to their disability or
sexual orientation (figure 10.2 and table 10.2).

Students' experiences of being targets of specific types of
hate-related words in 2007 differed according to their sex
and race/ethnicity (table 10.2). A greater percentage of
female students than male students (3 vs. 1 percent) reported
being called a gender-related hate word. However, a greater
percentage of male students than female students reported
being called hate-related words relating to race and
ethnicity. Five percent of male students compared to 4
percent of female students reported being targets of a
hate-related word regarding race and 4 percent of male
students compared to 2 percent of female students reported
being targets of a hate-related word regarding ethnicity. A
smaller percentage of White students (3 percent) reported
being called race-related hate words than Black students (7
percent), Hispanic students (6 percent), Asian students (11
percent), and students from other race/ethnicities (8
percent). Smaller percentages of both White students and
Black students (2 percent each) reported hate-related words
regarding their ethnicity than Hispanic and Asian students (7
percent each).

Indicator 11
Bullying at School and Cyber-Bullying Anywhere

In 2007, about 32 percent of 12- to 18-year-old students
reported having been bullied at school during the school year
and 4 percent reported having been cyber-bullied.

Both bullying and being bullied at school are associated with
key violence-related behaviors, including carrying weapons,
fighting, and sustaining injuries from fighting (Nansel et
al. 2003). In the 2007 School Crime Supplement ***(Footnote
29 In 2007, the unit response rate for this survey did not
meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the
data with caution. For more information, please see appendix
A).*** to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students
ages 12 18 were asked if they had been bullied at school
during the school year.***(Footnote 30 "At school" includes
the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or
going to and from school).***
 
In 2007, about 32 percent of students reported having been
bullied at school during the school year (figure 11.1 and
table 11.1).***(Footnote 31 Bullying includes being made fun
of; being the subject of rumors; being threatened with harm;
being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured
into doing things did not want to do; excluded; and having
property destroyed on purpose).*** Twenty-one percent of
students said that they had experienced bullying that
consisted of being made fun of; 18 percent reported being the
subject of rumors; 11 percent said that they were pushed,
shoved, tripped, or spit on; 6 percent said they were
threatened with harm; 5 percent said they were excluded from
activities on purpose; and 4 percent  each said that someone
tried to make them do things they did not want to do and that
their property was destroyed on purpose (figure 11.2 and
table 11.1). 

Of those students in 2007 who reported being bullied during
the school year, 79 percent said that they were bullied
inside the school, 23 percent said that they were bullied
outside on school grounds, 8 percent said they were bullied
on the school bus, and 4 percent said they were bullied
somewhere else (figure 11.3 and table 11.2). Nine percent of
all students reported that they had suffered injuries as a
result of being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on. Of these
students who had been bullied, 63 percent said that they had
been bullied once or twice during the school year, 21 percent
had experienced bullying once or twice a month, 10 percent
reported being bullied once or twice a week, and 7 percent
said that they had been bullied almost daily (figure 11.4 and
table 11.3). Thirty-six percent of students who were bullied
notified a teacher or another adult at school about the
event(s).

In 2007, about 4 percent of students reported having been
cyber-bullied ***(Footnote 32 Cyber-bullying includes
students who responded that another student posted hurtful
information about the respondent on the Internet; made
unwanted contact by threatening or insulting the respondent
via instant messaging; or made unwanted contact by
threatening or insulting the respondent via text (SMS)
messaging. The latter category did not meet statistical
standards to be reported separately).*** anywhere (on or off
school property) during the school year (figure 11.1 and
table 11.1). Two percent of students said that they had
experienced cyber-bullying that consisted of another student
posting hurtful information about them on the Internet; and 2
percent of students reported unwanted contact, including
being threatened or insulted, via instant messaging by
another student during the school year (figure 11.2 and table
11.1).

Of the students in 2007 who reported cyber-bullying during
the school year, 73 percent said it had occurred once or
twice during that period, 21 percent said it had occurred
once or twice a month, and 5 percent said it had occurred
once or twice a week (figure 11.4 and table 11.3). Thirty
percent of students who were cyber-bullied notified a teacher
or another adult at school about the event(s).

Student reports of bullying and cyber-bullying varied by
student characteristics. A greater percentage of female than
male students reported being bullied at school and
cyber-bullied anywhere during the school year (figure 11.1
and table 11.1). In 2007, 33 percent of female students
reported being bullied at school compared to 30 percent of
male students. Five percent of female students reported being
cyber-bullied anywhere compared to 2 percent of male
students. A higher percentage of White students (34 percent)
reported being bullied at school in 2007 than Hispanic
students (27 percent). In addition, a higher percentage of
White students (34 percent) reported being bullied at school
than Asian students (18 percent).

Indicator 12
Teachers' Reports on School Conditions

The percentage of teachers who reported that student
misbehavior, class cutting, and tardiness interfered  with
their teaching varied by teacher and school characteristics.
A higher percentage of teachers in city schools  than in
suburban, rural, or town schools reported that misbehavior
and student tardiness interfered with  their teaching in
2003 04. 

Classroom disruptions are associated with lower student
achievement for the offending student as well as for that
student's classmates (Lannie and McCurdy 2007). In the
Schools and Staffing Survey, public and private school
teachers were asked if student misbehavior and student
tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching.
In 2003 04, 35 percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed
that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and
31 percent reported that student tardiness and class cutting
interfered with their teaching (table 12.1). Teachers were
also asked if school rules were enforced by other teachers at
their school, even for students not in their classes, or by
the principal. Seventy-two percent of teachers agreed or
strongly agreed that other teachers at their school enforced
the school rules and 88 percent reported that the principal
enforced the school rules in 2003 04 (figure 12.1 and table
12.2). 

The percentage of teachers who reported that student
misbehavior, class cutting, and tardiness interfered with
their teaching varied by teacher and school characteristics.
In 2003 04, a higher percentage of teachers in city schools
than in suburban, town, or rural schools reported that
misbehavior and student tardiness interfered with their
teaching (table 12.1). For example, 42 percent of teachers in
city schools reported that student misbehavior in their
school interfered with their teaching, compared to 33 percent
of suburban teachers, 34 percent of town teachers, and 31
percent of rural teachers. Between 1987 88 and 2003 04, a
larger percentage of public school teachers than private
school teachers reported that student misbehavior and
tardiness interfered with their teaching (figure 12.2 and
table 12.1). In 2003 04, about 37 percent of public school
teachers reported that student misbehavior interfered with
their teaching, compared to 21 percent of private school
teachers. In 2003 04, a higher percentage of secondary school
teachers than elementary school teachers agreed that student
misbehavior, student tardiness, and class cutting interfered
with their teaching (table 12.1). In 2003 04, for example, 40
percent of secondary school teachers reported that student
misbehavior interfered with their teaching, compared to 34
percent of elementary teachers. 

The percentage of teachers who agreed that school rules were
enforced by other teachers varied by teacher and school
characteristics. In every survey year, a higher percentage of
elementary school teachers than secondary school teachers
agreed that school rules were enforced by teachers in their
school, even for students not in their class (table 12.2 and
figure 12.1). In 2003 04, for example, 79 percent of
elementary teachers reported that school rules were enforced
by other teachers compared to 56 percent of secondary
teachers. Generally, the percentage of teachers who agreed or
strongly agreed that school rules were enforced by other
teachers was greater in schools with smaller school
enrollment (table 12.2). In 2003 04, about 84 percent of
teachers in schools with fewer than 200 students agreed that
school rules were enforced by other teachers, compared to 56
percent of teachers in schools with 1,000 or more students.

Indicator 13 
Physical Fights on School Property and Anywhere

The percentage of students in grades 9 12 who reported being
in a physical fight on school property decreased from 16
percent in 1993 to 12 percent in 2007.

Schools where physical fights occur frequently may not be
able to maintain a focused learning environment for students.
Also, students who participate in fights on school property
may have difficulty succeeding in their studies (Payne,
Gottfredson, and Gottfredson 2003). In the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, students in grades 9 12 were asked about
their general involvement in physical fights (referred to as
"anywhere" in this indicator) during the preceding 12 months,
as well as about their involvement in physical fights on
school property.***(Footnote 33 "On school property" was not
defined for survey respondents).*** Fights occurring anywhere
are included as a point of comparison with fights occurring
on school property. In 2007, 36 percent of students in grades
9 12 reported having been in a fight anywhere, and 12 percent
said they had been in a fight on school property (figure 13.1
and table 13.1). The percentage of students who reported
having been in a fight anywhere decreased from 1993 to 2003
(from 42 to 33 percent). From 2003 to 2005, this percentage
rose to 36 percent, but no measurable change was seen between
2005 and 2007. The percentage of students who reported having
been in a fight on school property declined from 16 percent
in 1993 to 12 percent in 2007.

In all survey years, a higher percentage of males than
females reported having been in a fight both anywhere and on
school property (figure 13.1 and table 13.1). In 2007, 44
percent of males said they had been in a fight anywhere,
compared with 27 percent of females. In the same year, 16
percent of males said they had been in a fight on school
property, compared with 9 percent of females. From 1993
through 2003, the percentage of both males and females who
reported they had been in a fight anywhere decreased. The
percentage of males reporting they had been in a fight on
school property decreased from 1993 to 2007, however, there
was no measurable change in the percentage of females who
reported fighting on school property.

Generally, a higher percentage of students in 9th grade
reported having been in fights than students in 11th and 12th
grades, both anywhere and on school property (figure 13.2 and
table 13.1). For example, in 2007, 41 percent of 9th-graders
compared with 35 percent of 11th-graders, and 28 percent of
12th-graders reported having been in a fight anywhere.
Similarly, 17 percent of 9th-graders compared with 11 percent
of 11th-graders, and 9 percent of 12th-graders reported being
in a fight on school property in 2007.

The percentage of students engaging in fights varied
according to their race/ethnicity in 2007. A smaller
percentage of Asian students than students from all other
racial/ethnic groups reported having been in a fight
anywhere. Twenty-four percent of Asian students reported
being in a fight, compared with 32 to 48 percent of students
from other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, a higher
percentage of Black students and students of more than one
race reported having been in a fight anywhere than their
White, Hispanic, or American Indian/Alaska Native peers. A
lower percentage of Asian and White students reported having
been in a fight on school property in 2007 than Black
students, Hispanic students, American Indian/Alaska Native
students, or students of more than one race (8 and 10 percent
vs. 15 to 20 percent).

In 2007, the percentage of students who reported having been
in a fight anywhere (38 states and the District of Columbia)
and on school property (39 states and the District of
Columbia) varied among the states and the District of
Columbia for which data were available. Among these states
and the District of Columbia, the percentage of students
reporting being in a fight anywhere ranged from 24 percent in
Iowa to 43 percent in the District of Columbia, while the
percentage of students reporting being in a fight on school
property ranged from 7 percent in Hawaii to 20 percent in the
District of Columbia (table 13.2).

Indicator 14 
Students Carrying Weapons on School Property and Anywhere

In 2007, 18 percent of students in grades 9 12 reported they
had carried a weapon anywhere in the past 30 days, while 6
percent reported they had carried a weapon on school
property.

The presence of weapons at school may interfere with teaching
and learning by creating an intimidating and threatening
atmosphere (Aspy et al. 2004). In the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey, students were asked if they had carried a weapon such
as a gun, knife, or club (referred to as "anywhere" in this
indicator) in the past 30 days as well as if they had carried
one of these weapons on school property.***(Footnote 34 "On
school property" was not defined for survey respondents).***
Weapon carrying anywhere is included as a point of comparison
with weapon carrying on school property. In 2007, 18 percent
of students in grades 9 12 reported they had carried a weapon
anywhere, and 6 percent reported they had carried a weapon on
school property (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). 

The percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon
anywhere declined from 22 to 17 percent between 1993 and
2003. Subsequently, however, from 2003 to 2007 there was no
measurable change in the percentage of students who reported
carrying a weapon anywhere. Between 1993 and 2007, the
percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon on
school property declined from 12 to 6 percent; generally,
however, the decline was gradual as no differences were
detected survey year to survey year.

In every survey year, generally, there were at least three
times as many males as females who reported carrying a
weapon either anywhere or on school property (figure 14.1 and
table 14.1). In 2007, for example, 9 percent of males carried
a weapon on school property, compared to 3 percent of
females, and 29 percent of males carried a weapon anywhere,
compared to 7 percent of females. 

In 2007, few differences were detected based on students'
race/ethnicity in the percentage of students who reported
carrying weapons anywhere and on school property. A smaller
percentage of Asian students (8 percent) than students from
other racial/ethnic groups reported carrying a weapon
anywhere, but no measurable differences were detected among
Black students (17 percent), White students (18 percent), and
Hispanic students (19 percent). A larger percentage of
Hispanic students (7 percent) than White students (5 percent)
and Asian students (4 percent) reported carrying a weapon
during the previous 30 days on school property in 2007, but
no other differences were detected by race/ethnicity.

In 2007, 20 percent of 9th-graders reported carrying a weapon
anywhere compared to 15 percent of 12th-graders (figure 14.2
and table 14.1). However, no differences were detected in the
percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon on
school property by grade level.

In 2007, the percentage of students who reported carrying a
weapon anywhere (36 states and the District of Columbia) and
on school property (39 states and the District of Columbia)
varied among the states and the District of Columbia for
which data were available. Among these states and the
District of Columbia, the percentage of students reporting
carrying a weapon anywhere ranged from 13 percent in Iowa to
27 percent in New Mexico, while the percentage of students
reporting carrying a weapon on school property ranged from 4
percent in Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin to 11
percent in Wyoming (table 14.2).

Indicator 15
Students' Use of Alcohol on School Property and Anywhere

In 2007, 45 percent of students in grades 9 12 reported
having at least one drink of alcohol anywhere in the past 30
days, while 4 percent had at least one drink on school
property.

Students' illegal consumption of alcohol on school property
may lead to additional crimes and misbehavior (Kodjo,
Auinger, and Ryan 2003). It may also foster a school
environment that is harmful to students, teachers, and other
staff (Fagan and Wilkinson 1998). In the Youth Risk Behavior
Survey, students in grades 9 12 were asked whether they had
consumed alcohol at all (referred to as "anywhere" in this
indicator) in the past 30 days and if they had consumed
alcohol on school property.***(Footnote 35 "On school
property" was not defined for survey respondents).*** Alcohol
consumption anywhere is included as a point of comparison
with alcohol consumption on school property. In 2007, 45
percent of students consumed at least one drink of alcohol
anywhere, and 4 percent consumed at least one drink on school
property (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). 

The percentage of students who reported drinking alcohol
anywhere was higher in 1995 (52 percent) than in 1993 (48
percent), and declined from 1995 to 2007 to 45 percent.
Generally, the percentage of students who reported consuming
alcohol on school property declined from 6 percent in 1995 to
4 percent in 2007.

The percentage of students who reported drinking alcohol
anywhere or on school property varied by student
characteristics such as sex, grade level, and race/ethnicity.
In every survey year, a greater percentage of males than
females reported using alcohol on school property. For
example, in 2007, 5 percent of males compared to 4 percent of
females reported using alcohol on school property. However,
since 2003, there has been no measurable difference in the
percentage of males and females who reported using alcohol
anywhere. In 2007, 45 percent of both males and females
reported using alcohol anywhere.

A larger percentage of students in higher grades than in
lower grades reported drinking alcohol anywhere in 2007. For
example, 55 percent of 12th-graders reported using alcohol,
compared to 36 percent of 9th-graders, 42 percent of
10th-graders, and 49 percent of 11th-graders (figure 15.2 and
table 15.1). A higher percentage of 12th-graders (5 percent)
than 9th-graders (3 percent) reported drinking on school
property; however, no measurable differences were found among
other grade levels. 

In 2007, a larger percentage of White and Hispanic students
reported drinking alcohol anywhere than their Black, Asian,
or American Indian/Alaska Native peers, and a smaller
percentage of Asian students reported drinking alcohol
anywhere than students from other race/ethnicities.
Forty-seven percent of White students and 48 percent of
Hispanic students reported drinking alcohol anywhere compared
to 35 percent of  American Indian/Alaska Native students, 34
percent of Black students, and 25 percent of Asian students.
A greater percentage of Hispanic students (7 percent)
reported using alcohol on school property in 2007 than White
students (3 percent), Black students (3 percent), Asian
students (4 percent), or American Indian/Alaska Native
students (5 percent). 

In 2007, the percentage of students who reported drinking
alcohol anywhere (39 states and the District of Columbia) and
on school property (38 states and the District of Columbia)
varied among the states and the District of Columbia for
which data were available. Among these states and the
District of Columbia, the percentage of students who reported
drinking alcohol anywhere ranged from 17 percent in Utah to
49 percent in Wisconsin, while the percentage of students who
reported drinking on school property ranged from 3 percent in
Iowa, Missouri, and Ohio to 9 percent in New Mexico (table
15.2).

Indicator 16 Students' Use of Marijuana on School Property
and Anywhere

In 2007, 20 percent of students in grades 9 12 reported using
marijuana anywhere in the past 30 days, while 4 percent
reported using marijuana on school property.

In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9 12
were asked whether they had used marijuana at all (referred
to as "anywhere" in this indicator) in the past 30 days as
well as whether they had used marijuana on school property.
***(Footnote 36 "On school property" was not defined for
survey respondents).*** In 2007, 20 percent of students in
grades 9 12 reported using marijuana anywhere in the past 30
days, while 4 percent reported using marijuana on school
property (figure 16.1 and table 16.1). 

The percentage of students who reported using marijuana
anywhere was higher in 1995 (25 percent) than in 1993 (18
percent). During the second half of the 1990s, there was no
measurable change in the percentage of students who reported
using marijuana anywhere (it ranged from 25 to 27 percent).
Between 1999 and 2007, the percentage of students who
reported using marijuana anywhere had declined to 20 percent.
However, there was no measurable change in the percentage of
students who reported using marijuana anywhere between 2005
and 2007.

With regard to marijuana use on school property, the
percentage of students who reported using marijuana was
higher in 1995 (9 percent) than the percentage who reported
doing so in 1993 (6 percent). Between 1995 and 2007, the
percentage of students who reported using marijuana on school
property declined from 9 to 4 percent. The percentage of
students who reported using marijuana on school property in
2007 was not measurably different from the percentage of
students who reported doing so in 1993.

Marijuana use anywhere and on school property varied by
students' sex and grade level. In every survey year, a
greater percentage of males than females reported using
marijuana in the past 30 days, both anywhere and on school
property. For example, in 2007, 22 percent of males reported
using marijuana anywhere in the past 30 days compared to 17
percent of females, and 6 percent of males reported using
marijuana on school property compared to 3 percent of
females.

In 2007, a smaller percentage of 9th-grade students than
students in higher grades reported using marijuana anywhere.
In 2007, 15 percent of 9th-grade students reported using
marijuana anywhere compared to 19 percent of 10th-graders, 21
percent of 11th-graders, and 25 percent of 12th-graders
(figure 16.2 and table 16.1). There were no measurable
differences in student reports of marijuana use on school
property by school level in 2007. 

In 2007, a smaller percentage of Asian students (9 percent)
than students from other racial/ethnic groups (ranging from
18 to 29 percent) reported using marijuana anywhere. A larger
percentage of  American Indian/Alaska Native students (27
percent) than White students (20 percent), Hispanic students
(18 percent), and Asian students (9 percent) also reported
using marijuana anywhere. At school, there were generally few
differences in the percentage of students who reported using
marijuana by race/ethnicity in 2007. 

In 2007, the percentage of students who reported using
marijuana anywhere (39 states and the District of Columbia)
and on school property (38 states and the District of
Columbia) varied among the states and the District of
Columbia for which data were available. Among these states
and the District of Columbia, the percentage of students who
reported using marijuana anywhere ranged from 9 percent in
Utah to 25 percent in Delaware, Massachusetts, and New
Mexico, while the percentage of students who reported using
marijuana on school property and ranged from 2 percent in
Iowa to 8 percent in New Mexico (table 16.2).

Indicator 17 
Students' Perceptions of Personal Safety at School and Away
From School

In 2007, approximately 5 percent of students ages 12 18
reported that they were afraid of attack or harm at school,
compared to 3 percent of students who reported that they were
afraid of attack or harm away from school.

School violence can make students fearful and affect their
readiness and ability to learn, and concerns about
vulnerability to attacks detract from a positive school
environment (Scheckner et al. 2002). In the School Crime
Supplement ***(Footnote 37 In 2005 and 2007, the unit
response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical
standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. In
2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in
prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6
months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 are
comparable to previous years. For more information, please
see appendix A).***  to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, students ages 12 18 were asked how often they had
been afraid of attack or harm "at school or on the way to and
from school" and "away from school."***(Footnote 39 "At
school" includes the school building, on school property, on
a school bus).*** In 2007, a greater percentage of students
ages 12 18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm
at school (5 percent) than away from school (3 percent)
during the school year (figure 17.1 and table 17.1). 

Students' reports on their fears about their safety varied by
location and race/ethnicity. For example, in 2007, smaller
percentages of White students (4 percent) and Asian students
(2 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm at school
than their Black (9 percent) and Hispanic (7 percent) peers.
Away from school, a smaller percentage of White students (3
percent) than Black students (5 percent) and Hispanic
students (6 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm. 

Other differences in students' reports on their safety were
detected by student and school characteristics in 2007. For
example, a higher percentage of 6th-graders 10 percent)
reported being afraid of attack or harm at school than
7th-graders (7 percent), 8th-graders (5 percent), 9th-graders
(6 percent), 10th-graders (5 percent), and 11th- and
12th-graders (3 percent each). Away from school, a larger
percentage of 6th-graders (6 percent) were afraid of attack
or harm than students in the 10th, 11th, or 12th grades 
(2 to 3 percent).

A greater percentage of female students (6 percent) feared
for their safety at school than male students (5 percent) in
2007. The same was true away from school: 5 percent of
females feared for their safety compared to 2 percent of
males. 

School sector was also related to students' fear of attack or
harm. A greater percentage of students in public schools (6
percent) reported being afraid of being attacked or harmed at
school than students attending private schools (2 percent).
There was no significant difference in the percentage of
public and private school students who reported being afraid
of attack or harm away from school.

Between 1995 and 2007, the percentage of students who feared
attack or harm at school decreased from 12 to 5 percent.
Between the two most recent survey years, 2005 and 2007, the
percentage of students who feared attack or harm at school
was lower in 2007 (5 percent) than in 2005 (6 percent). Away
from school, there was no pattern of increase or decrease in
the percentage of students who feared attack or harm between
1999 and 2007. However, the percentage of students who feared
attack or harm away from school was smaller in 2007 (3
percent) than in 2005 (5 percent).

--------------------------------------------------------

Indicator 18 
Students' Reports of Avoiding School Activities or Specific
Places in School

In 2007, 7 percent of students ages 12 18 reported that they
avoided school activities or one or more places in school
because they thought someone might attack or harm them.

School crime may lead students to perceive school as unsafe,
and in trying to ensure their own safety, students may begin
to skip school activities or avoid certain places in school
(Schreck and Miller 2003). The percentage of students who
avoid school activities and certain areas in school is a
measure of their perception of school safety. In the School
Crime Supplement ***(Footnote 39 In 2005 and 2007, the unit
response rate for this survey did not meet NCES statistical
standards; therefore, interpret the data with caution. In
2007, the reference period was the school year, whereas in
prior survey years the reference period was the previous 6
months. Cognitive testing showed that estimates from 2007 are
comparable to previous years. For more information, please
see appendix A).***  to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, students ages 12 18 were asked whether they had
avoided school activities or one or more places in school
because they were fearful that someone might attack or harm
them.***(Footnote 40 For the 2001 survey, the wording was
changed from "attack or harm" to "attack or threat of
attack." See appendix A for more information).*** In 2007, 7
percent of students reported that they had avoided a school
activity or one or more places in school during the previous
school year because of fear of attack or harm. About 3
percent of students avoided a school activity, and 6 percent
avoided one or more places in school ***(Footnote 41 "Avoided
school activities" includes avoiding any (extracurricular)
activities, skipping class, or staying home from school. In
2007, the survey wording was changed from "any
extracurricular activities" to "any activities." Please use
caution when comparing changes in this item over time.
Avoiding one or more places in school includes the entrance,
any hallways or stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms,
and other places inside the school building).*** (figure 18.1
and table 18.1).

While there was no overall pattern of increase or decrease
between 1999 and 2007 in the percentage of students who
reported that they had avoided a school activity or one or
more places in school because they were fearful that someone
might attack or harm them, the percentage of students who
reported avoiding an activity or place because of fear of
attack or harm was higher in 2007 (7 percent) than in 2005 (6
percent).

In 2007, 2 percent of students reported that they had avoided
any activity, 1 percent of students reported that they had
avoided a class, and 1 percent of students reported that they
had stayed home from school because they were fearful someone
might attack or harm them. One percent of students reported
that they had avoided the entrance to the school, 3 percent
that they had avoided the stairs or hallways, 2 percent that
they had avoided parts of the school cafeteria, 3 percent
that they had avoided any school restrooms, and 1 percent
that they had avoided other places inside the school building
because of fear of attack or harm in 2007.

Students' reports of avoiding one or more places in school
because of fear of attack or harm varied by student and
school characteristics. A higher percentage of 7th-graders (7
percent), 8th-graders (6 percent), 9th-graders (7 percent),
and 10th-graders (5 percent) reported avoiding one or more
places inside school than 12th-graders (3 percent) (figure
18.2). Additionally, a higher percentage of 6th-graders (8
percent), 7th-graders (7 percent), and 9th-graders (7
percent) than 11th-graders (4 percent) reported of avoiding
one or more places in school because of fear of attack or
harm. No measurable difference was detected in the extent to
which females and males avoided one or more places in school
in 2007 (5 and 6 percent, respectively).

A larger percentage of public school students (6 percent)
than private school students (1 percent) reported avoiding
one or more places inside school because of fear of attack or
harm.

Indicator 19
Serious Disciplinary Actions Taken by Public Schools

Forty-eight percent of public schools (approximately 39,600
schools) took a serious disciplinary action against a student
for specific offenses during the 2005 06 school year. Of
those disciplinary actions, 74 percent were suspensions
lasting 5 days or more, 5 percent were removals with no
services (i.e., expulsions), and 20 percent were transfers to
specialized schools.

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school
officials were asked to report the number of disciplinary
actions their schools took against students for specific
offenses. 

Forty-eight percent of public schools (approximately 39,600
schools) took at least one serious disciplinary action
against a student including suspensions lasting 5 days or
more, removals with no services (i.e., expulsions), and
transfers to specialized schools for specific offenses during
the 2005 06 school year (table 19.1). The offenses included
physical attacks or fights; insubordination; distribution,
possession, or use of alcohol; distribution, possession, or
use of illegal drugs; use or possession of a weapon other
than a firearm or explosive device; and use or possession of
a firearm or explosive device. Of the 830,700 serious
disciplinary actions taken during the 2005 06 school year, 74
percent were suspensions for 5 days or more, 5 percent were
removals with no services, and 20 percent were transfers to
specialized schools. 

The largest percentage of schools that reported taking a
disciplinary action in 2005 06 did so in response to a
physical attack or fight: 32 percent of schools took a
serious disciplinary action for physical attacks or fights
(figure 19.1 and table 19.1). Of the schools that reported
taking a serious disciplinary action, 21 percent took action
for insubordination and for distribution, possession, or use
of illegal drugs; 19 percent took action as a result of use
or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive
device; 10 percent did so for distribution, possession, or
use of alcohol; and 5 percent did so for use or possession of
a firearm or explosive device. 

The percentage of schools that took a serious disciplinary
action for use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm
was higher in 2005 06, 19 percent, than in 2003 04, 17
percent (table 19.2). The percentage of schools that took a
serious disciplinary action in response to the other offenses
covered in the survey were not measurably different between
2003 04 and 2005 06. The percentage of public schools that
took a serious disciplinary action was smaller in 2003 04, 46
percent, than in 1999 2000, 54 percent (figure 19.2 and table
19.2). This pattern held for physical attacks or fights: in
1999 2000, 35 percent of public schools took a serious
disciplinary action for a physical attack or fight, compared
to 32 percent in 2003 04.

---------------------------------------------------------

Indicator 20
Safety and Security Measures Taken by Public Schools

Between the 1999 2000 and 2005 06 school years, the
percentage of schools using one or more security cameras to
monitor the school increased from 19 to 43 percent.

Public schools use a variety of practices and procedures
intended to promote the safety of students and staff. This
indicator provides information on what types of safety and
security measures schools use and how frequently they use
them. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school
officials were asked about their school's use of such
measures and procedures. Certain practices, such as locked or
monitored doors or gates, are intended to limit or control
access to school campuses, while others, such as metal
detectors, security cameras, and drug sweeps, are intended to
monitor or restrict students' and visitors' behavior on
campus.

In the 2005 06 school year, 85 percent of public schools
controlled access to school buildings by locking or
monitoring doors during school hours, and 41 percent
controlled access to school grounds with locked or monitored
gates (figure 20.1 and table 20.1). About 48 percent of
public schools required faculty and staff to wear badges or
picture identification, and 43 percent used one or more
security cameras to monitor the school. Five percent of
public schools performed drug testing on athletes and 3
percent did so for students in other extracurricular
activities. Students were required to wear uniforms in 14
percent of public schools in 2005 06.

The use of security measures varied by school level. Although
a lower percentage of primary schools than middle and high
schools reported using many of these measures, a higher
percentage of primary schools than middle and high schools
controlled access to school buildings and grounds during
school hours (table 20.1). In addition, a larger percentage
of primary schools than high schools reported requiring
students to wear uniforms: 16 percent of primary schools
required uniforms in 2005 06, compared to 5 percent of high
schools. A higher percentage of public high schools than
primary or middle schools reported performing drug tests on
student athletes and students in extracurricular activities,
random dog sniffs to check for drugs, random sweeps for
contraband, and using security cameras. Thirteen percent of
high schools reported performing drug tests on athletes,
compared to 7 percent of middle schools and 1 percent of
primary schools; and 61 percent of
high schools performed random dog sniffs to check for drugs,
compared to 41 percent and 4 percent of middle and primary
schools, respectively.

The percentage of schools using various security measures has
changed over time. Between the 1999 2000 and 2005 06 school
years, the percentage of schools using one or more security
cameras to monitor the school increased from 19 to 43 percent
(figure 20.2 and table 20.2). The percentage of public
schools providing telephones in most classrooms also
increased, from 45 percent in 1999 2000 to 67 percent in
2005 06.

This indicator repeats information from the 2007 Indicators
of School Crime and Safety report. For more information:

-------------------------------------------------------

Indicator 21
Students' Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed at
School

Sixty-six percent of students reported observing the use of
one or more security cameras at their school in 2007 compared
to 58 percent of students in 2005.

Schools use a variety of measures to promote the safety of
students, ranging from codes of student conduct to metal
detectors. In the School Crime Supplement ***(Footnote 42 In
2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for this survey did not
meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, interpret the
data with caution. For more information, please see appendix
A.*** to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students
ages 12 18 were asked whether their school used certain
security measures).***(Footnote 43 Readers should note that
this indicator relies on student reports of security measures
and provides estimates based on students' awareness of the
measure rather than on documented practice. See Indicator 20
for a summary of the use of various security measures as
reported by schools).*** Security measures include metal
detectors, locker checks, security cameras, security guards
or police officers, adult supervision in hallways, badges or
picture identification for students, a code of student
conduct, locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a
requirement that visitors sign in. In 2007, nearly all
students ages 12 18 observed the use of at least one of the
selected security measures at their school (figure 21.1 and
table 21.1). 

In 2007, the majority of students ages 12 18 reported that
their school had a code of student conduct (96 percent) and a
requirement that visitors sign in (94 percent). Ninety
percent of students reported the presence of school staff or
other adult supervision in the hallway, and 69 percent
reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned
police officers. Fifty-four percent of students reported
locker checks, 61 percent reported locked entrance or exit
doors during the day, and 66 percent reported the use of
security cameras at their schools. Twenty-four percent of
students reported that badges or picture identification were
required. Metal detectors were the least observed of the
selected safety and security measures: 10 percent of students
reported the use of metal detectors at their school.  

The percentage of students reporting the presence of some of
the selected security measures increased between the 2 most
recent survey years as well as over longer time periods. For
example, a greater percentage of students reported observing
the use of one or more security cameras at their school in
2007 (66 percent) than in 2005 (58 percent). Over the longer
time period of 2001 through 2007, the percentage of students
who reported observing the use of one or more security
cameras at their school increased from 39 to 66 percent.
Similarly, a greater percentage of students reported locked
entrance or exit doors during the day in 2007 (61 percent)
than in 2005 (54 percent). Over the longer time period of
1999 through 2007, the percentage of students who reported
locked entrance or exit doors during the day increased from
38 to 61 percent. 

In 2007, about 94 percent of students reported that their
school had a requirement that visitors sign in compared to 93
percent of students in 2005. Between 1999 and 2007, the
percentage of students who reported a visitor sign-in
requirement increased from 87 to 94 percent. No significant
differences were detected in the percentage of students who
reported metal detectors, locker checks, the presence of
security guards and/or assigned police officers, requirements
that students wear badges or picture identification, or a
code of student conduct in their schools across all survey
years.

APPENDIX A: TECHNICAL NOTES

Technical Notes

General Information

The indicators in this report are based on information drawn
from a variety of independent data sources, including
national surveys of students, teachers, and principals, and
data collections from federal departments and agencies,
including the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National
Center for Education Statistics, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample
design, data collection method, and questionnaire design or
is the result of a universe data collection. Universe data
collections include a census of all known entities in a
specific universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on school
property). Readers should be cautious when comparing data
from different sources. Differences in sampling procedures,
populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all
affect the comparability of results. For example, some
questions from different surveys may appear the same, but
were asked of different populations of students (e.g.,
students ages 12 18 or students in grades 9 12); in different
years; about experiences that occurred within different
periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during the past
12 months); or at different locations (e.g., in school or
anywhere). 

All comparisons described in this report are statistically
significant at the .05 level. Estimates displayed in the
text, figures, and tables are rounded from original
estimates, not from a series of rounding. 

The following is a description of data sources, accuracy of
estimates, and statistical procedures used in this report.

Sources of Data

This section briefly describes each of the datasets used in
this report: the School-Associated Violent Deaths
Surveillance Study, the Supplementary Homicide Reports, the
Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal,
the National Crime Victimization Survey, the School Crime
Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the Schools and Staffing Survey,
and the School Survey on Crime and Safety. Directions for
obtaining more information are provided at the end of each
description. 

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD) 

The School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study
(SAVD) is an epidemiological study developed by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction with the
U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of
Justice. SAVD seeks to describe the epidemiology of
school-associated violent deaths, identify common features of
these deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated violent
death in the United States, and identify potential risk
factors for these deaths.?The surveillance system includes
descriptive data on all school-associated violent deaths in
the United States, including all homicides, suicides, and
unintentional firearm-related deaths where the fatal injury
occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or
secondary school, while the victim was on the way to or from
regular sessions at such a school, or while attending or on
the way to or from an official school-sponsored event.
Victims of such events include nonstudents as well as
students and staff members. SAVD includes descriptive
information about the school, event, victim(s), and
offender(s). The SAVD Surveillance System has collected data
from July 1, 1992, through the present. 

SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on
school-associated violent deaths. Cases are initially
identified through a search of the Lexis/Nexis newspaper and
media database. Then police officials are contacted to
confirm the details of the case and to determine if the event
meets the case definition. Once a case is confirmed, a police
official and a school official are interviewed regarding
details about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s).
A copy of the full police report is also sought for each
case. The information obtained on schools includes school
demographics, attendance/absentee rates,
suspension/expulsions and mobility, school history of
weapon-carrying incidents, security measures, violence
prevention activities, school response to the event, and
school policies about weapon carrying. Event information
includes the location of injury, the context of injury (while
classes were being held, during break, etc.), motives for
injury, method of injury, and school and community events
happening around the time period. Information obtained on
victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics,
circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug use,
number of persons involved), types and origins of weapons,
criminal history, psychological risk factors, school-related
problems, extracurricular activities, and family history,
including structure and stressors. 

One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths were
identified from July 1, 1992 to June 30, 1994 (Kachur et al.
1996). A more recent report from this data collection
identified 253 school-associated violent deaths between July
1, 1994 and June 30, 1999 (Anderson et al. 2001). Other
publications from this study have described how the number of
events changes during the school year (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the firearms used
in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and suicides that were
associated with schools (Kauffman et al. 2004). The
interviews conducted on cases between July 1, 1994, and June
30, 1999, achieved a response rate of 97 percent for police
officials and 78 percent for school officials. The SAVD data
are considered preliminary until interviews with school and
law enforcement officials have been completed. The details
learned during the interviews can occasionally change the
classification of a case. For additional information about

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) 

The Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), which are a part of
the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, provide
incident-level information on criminal homicides, including
situation (number of victims to number of offenders); the
age, sex, and race of victims and offenders; types of weapons
used; circumstances of the incident; and the relationship of
the victim to the offender. The data are provided monthly to
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) by local law
enforcement agencies participating in the FBI's UCR program.
The data include murders and nonnegligent manslaughters in
the United States from January 1976 to December 2005; that
is, negligent manslaughters and justifiable homicides have
been eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement
agency reports, the FBI estimates that 594,277 murders
(including non-negligent manslaughters) were committed from
1976 to 2005. Agencies provided detailed information on
538,210 victims and 597,359 offenders. 

About 91 percent of homicides are included in the SHR.
However, adjustments can be made to the weights to correct
for missing reports. Estimates from the SHR used in this
report were generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS) using a weight developed by BJS that reconciles the
counts of SHR homicide victims with those in the UCR for the
1992 through 2005 data years. The weight is the same for all
cases for a given year. The weight represents the ratio of
the number of homicides reported in the UCR to the number
reported in the SHR. For additional information about SHR,

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal
(WISQARS  Fatal) 

WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to injury. The
mortality data reported in WISQARS Fatal come from death
certificate data reported to the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Data include causes of death reported by
attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. It
also includes demographic information about decedents
reported by funeral directors, who obtain that information
from family members and other informants. NCHS collects,
compiles, verifies, and prepares these data for release to
the public. The data provide information about what types of
injuries are leading causes of deaths, how common they are,
and who they affect. These data are intended for a broad
audience the public, the media, public health practitioners
and researchers, and public health officials to increase
their knowledge of injury. 

WISQARS Fatal mortality reports provide tables of the total
numbers of injury-related deaths and the death rates per
100,000 U.S. population. The reports list deaths according to
cause (mechanism) and intent (manner) of injury by state,
race, Hispanic origin, sex, and age groupings. For more

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) 

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), administered
for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics by the U.S. Census
Bureau, is the nation's primary source of information on
crime and the victims of crime. Initiated in 1972 and
redesigned in 1992, the NCVS collects detailed information
annually on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape,
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault,
theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft
experienced by Americans and their households each year. The
survey measures both crimes reported to police and crimes not
reported to the police. 

Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with changes
to the Office of Management and Budget's standards for the
classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the
NCVS item on race/ethnicity was modified. A question on
Hispanic origin is followed by a question on race. The new
question about race allows the respondent to choose more than
one race and delineates Asian as a separate category from
Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Analysis conducted
by the Demographic Surveys Division at the U.S. Census Bureau
showed that the new question had very little impact on the
aggregate racial distribution of the NCVS respondents, with
one exception. There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in
the percentage of respondents who reported themselves as
White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity categories,
comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made
with caution. 

Due to changes in survey methodology in 2006 that mainly
affected rural areas, 2006 estimates are not comparable to
estimates based on NCVS data from previous years. Continuity
between urban and suburban areas in the sample for both years
(2005 and 2006) enabled year-to-year comparisons for these
areas. The U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS), and a panel of outside experts extensively
reviewed the 2006 NCVS data and determined that there was a
break in series between 2006 and previous years that
prevented annual comparison of criminal victimization at the
national level. This was mainly the result of three major
changes in the survey methodology: (1) introducing a new
sample to account for shifts in population and location of
households that occur over time, (2) incorporating responses
from households that were in the survey for the first time,
and (3) using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI).
For more information on the 2006 NCVS data, see Criminal
Victimization, 2006 at
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cv06.pdf and the
technical notes at
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cv06tn.pdf.

The number of NCVS eligible households in the sample in 2006
was about 41,800. They were selected using a stratified,
multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary
sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of
counties, were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas,
called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from each
sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four
households, called segments, were selected for interview. At
each stage, the selection was done proportionate to
population size in order to create a self-weighting sample.
The final sample was augmented to account for households
constructed after the decennial Census. Within each sampled
household, U.S. Census Bureau personnel interviewed all
household members age 12 and older to determine whether they
had been victimized by the measured crimes during the 6
months preceding the interview. 

The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in
person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone, if
possible. About 68,000 persons age 12 and older are
interviewed each 6 months. Households remain in the sample
for 3 years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month
intervals. Since the survey's inception, the initial
interview at each sample unit has been used only to bound
future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid
duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent
interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from the initial
interview have been adjusted to account for the effects of
bounding and are included in the survey estimates. After
their seventh interview, households are replaced by new
sample households. The NCVS has consistently obtained a
response rate of over 90 percent at the household level. The
completion rates for persons within households were about 86
percent. Thus, final response rates were about 78 percent in
2006. Weights were developed to permit estimates for the
total U.S. population 12 years and older. For more

School Crime Supplement (SCS) 

Created as a supplement to the NCVS and codesigned by the
National Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of
Justice Statistics, the School Crime Supplement (SCS) survey
was conducted in 1989, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007
to collect additional information about school-related
victimizations on a national level. This report includes data
from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 collections.
The 1989 data are not included in this report as a result of
methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS. The survey was
designed to assist policymakers as well as academic
researchers and practitioners at the federal, state, and
local levels so that they can make informed decisions
concerning crime in schools. The SCS asks students a number
of key questions about their experiences with and perceptions
of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on
school grounds, on a school bus, or on the way to or from
school. Additional questions not included in the NCVS were
also added to the SCS, such as those concerning preventive
measures used by the school, students' participation in after
school activities, students' perceptions of school rules, the
presence of weapons and gangs in school, the presence of
hate-related words and graffiti in school, student reports of
bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the
availability of drugs and alcohol in school, as well as
attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and
avoidance behavior at school. 

In all SCS survey years through 2005, the SCS was conducted
for a 6-month period from January to June in all households
selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information
about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the
race/ethnicity item made for 2003 onward). It should be noted
that the initial NCVS interview has always been included in
the SCS data collection. Within these households, the
eligible respondents for the SCS were those household members
who had attended school at any time during the 6 months
preceding the interview, were enrolled in grades 6 12, and
were not home schooled. In 2007, the questionnaire was
changed and household members who attended school any time
during the school year were included. The age range of
students covered in this report is 12 18 years of age.
Eligible respondents were asked the supplemental questions in
the SCS only after completing their entire NCVS interview.  

The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003,
2005, and 2007 was calculated by using NCVS incident
variables appended to the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and
2007 SCS data ?les. The NCVS type of crime variable was used
to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as serious
violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where
the incident happened and what the victim was doing when it
happened were used to ascertain whether the incident happened
at school. For prevalence of victimization, the NCVS
definition of "at school" includes in the school building, on
school property, or on the way to or from school. Only
incidents that occurred inside the United States are
included. 

In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified from previous
collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, "at school" was defined
for respondents as in the school building, on the school
grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the definition for "at
school" was changed to mean in the school building, on school
property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. This
change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order to be
consistent with the definition of "at school" as it is
constructed in the NCVS and was also used as the definition
in 2003, 2005, and 2007. Cognitive interviews conducted by
the U.S. Census Bureau on the 1999 SCS suggested that
modifications to the definition of "at school" would not have
a substantial impact on the estimates. 

A total of 9,728 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 8,398
in 1999, 8,374 in 2001, 7,152 in 2003, 6,297 in 2005, and
5,618 in 2007. In the 2007 SCS, the household completion rate
was 90 percent. In the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, and 2005 SCS,
the household completion rates were 95 percent, 94 percent,
93 percent, 92 percent, and 91 percent, respectively, and the
student completion rates were 78 percent, 78 percent, 77
percent, 70 percent, and 62 percent respectively. For the
2007 SCS, the student completion rate was 58 percent. 
Thus, the overall unweighted SCS response rate (calculated by
multiplying the household completion rate by the student
completion rate) was 74 percent in 1995, 73 percent in 1999,
72 percent in 2001, 64 percent in 2003, 56 percent in 2005,
and 53 percent in 2007. Response rates for most survey items
were high typically over 95 percent of all eligible
respondents. The weights were developed to compensate for
differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The
weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student
population who were enrolled in schools in 1995, 1999, 2001,
2003, 2005, and 2007. 

Due to the low unit response rate in 2005 and 2007, a unit
nonresponse bias analysis was done. There are two types of
nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse. Unit response rates
indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews.
Because interviews with students could only be completed
after households had responded to the NCVS, the unit
completion rate for the SCS reflects both the household
interview completion rate and the student interview
completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength
and application of survey data by leading to an increase in
variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the
sample and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have
characteristics of interest that are different from the
respondents. Furthermore, imputation, a common recourse to
nonresponse, can lead to the risk of underestimating the
sampling error if imputed data are treated as though they
were observed data. 

In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have
different response rates and responses to particular survey
variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is
determined by the response rate and the differences between
respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables.
Although the bias analysis cannot measure response bias since
the SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the
population would have responded, the SCS sampling frame has
four key student or school characteristic variables for which
data is known for respondents and nonrespondents: sex,
race/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity, all of
which are associated with student victimization. To the
extent that there are differential responses by respondents
in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern. 

In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence
of bias for the race, household income, and urbanicity
variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other (non-Hispanic)
respondents had higher response rates than Black
(non-Hispanic) and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from
households with an income of $35,000 $49,999 and $50,000 or
more had higher response rates than those from households
with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500 $14,999,
$15,000 $24,999 and $25,000 $34,999. Respondents who live in
urban areas had lower response rates than those who live in
rural or suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse
bias cannot be determined, weighting adjustments, which
corrected for differential response rates, should have
reduced the problem. 

In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence
of bias by race, household income, and urbanicity variables.
Hispanic respondents had lower response rates than other
race/ethnicities. Respondents from households with an income
of $25,000 or more had higher response rates than those from
households with incomes of less than $7,500. Respondents who
live in urban areas had lower response rates than those who
live in rural areas. However, when responding students are
compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no
measurable differences between the responding students and
the eligible students, suggesting the nonresponse bias has
little impact on the overall estimates.

Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) 

The National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)
is one component of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance
System (YRBSS), an epidemiological surveillance system
developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) to monitor the prevalence of youth behaviors that most
influence health.***(Footnote 1 For more information on the
YRBSS methodology, see Brener et al. (2004)).*** The YRBS
focuses on priority health-risk behaviors established during
youth that result in the most significant mortality,
morbidity, disability, and social problems during both youth
and adulthood. This report uses 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001,
2003, 2005, and 2007 YRBS data. 

The YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to
produce a nationally representative sample of students in
grades 9 12 in the United States. The target population
consisted of all public and private school students in grades
9 12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The
first-stage sampling frame included selecting primary
sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of
urbanization and the relative percentage of Black and
Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either counties,
subareas of large counties, or groups of smaller, adjacent
counties. At the second stage, schools were selected with
probability proportional to school enrollment size. 

The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly selecting,
in each chosen school and in each of grades 9 12, one or two
classrooms from either a required subject, such as English or
social studies, or a required period, such as homeroom or
second period. All students in selected classes were eligible
to participate. Three strategies were used to oversample
Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates were
used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and high-Hispanic
strata; (2) a modified measure of size was used that
increased the probability of selecting schools with a
disproportionately high minority enrollment; and (3) two
classes per grade, rather than one, were selected in schools
with a high minority enrollment. Approximately 16,300,
10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 13,600, 15,200, 13,900, and 14,000
students participated in the 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001,
2003, 2005, and 2007 surveys, respectively. 

The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey,
60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 1997
survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for the
2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, 67 percent for
the 2005 survey, and 68 percent for the 2007 survey. NCES
standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for
cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses are required by
NCES when that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a
full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the
data necessary to do the analysis are not available. The
weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the
oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample.
The final weights were constructed so that only weighted
proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) in
each grade matched national population projections. 

State level data were downloaded from the Youth Online:
Comprehensive Results web page
(http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/yrbss/).Each state and local
school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster sample design
to produce representative samples of students in grades 9 12
in their jurisdiction. All except a few state and local
samples include only public schools, and each local sample
includes only schools in the funded school district (e.g.,
San Diego Unified School District) rather than in the entire
city (e.g., greater San Diego area). 

In the first sampling stage in all except a few states and
districts, schools are selected with probability proportional
to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage,
intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during
a required period (e.g., second period) are selected
randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible to
participate. Certain states and districts modify these
procedures to meet their individual needs. For example, in a
given state or district, all schools, rather than a sample of
schools, might be selected to participate. State and local
surveys that have a scientifically selected sample,
appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate
greater than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall
response rate reflects the school response rate multiplied by
the student response rate. These three criteria are used to
ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered
representative of students in grades 9 12 in that
jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to adjust
for student nonresponse and the distribution of students by
grade, sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction.
Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all
students in grades 9 12 attending schools in each
jurisdiction. Surveys that do not have an overall response
rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and do not have
appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not
included in this report. 

In 2007, a total of 39 states and 22 districts had weighted
data. In sites with weighted data, the student sample sizes
for the state and local YRBS ranged from 1,118 to 13,439.
School response rates ranged from 69 to 100 percent, student
response rates ranged from 60 to 92 percent, and overall
response rates ranged from 60 to 90 percent. 
Readers should note that reports of these data published by
the CDC do not include percentages where the denominator
includes less than 100 unweighted cases. However, NCES
publications do not include percentages where the denominator
includes less than 30 unweighted cases. Therefore, estimates
presented here may not appear in CDC publications of YRBS
estimates and are considered unstable by CDC standards. 

In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of
Management and Budget's standards for the classification of
federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on
race/ethnicity was modified. The version of the race and
ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 was: 

How do you describe yourself? 
A. White not Hispanic 
B. Black not Hispanic 
C. Hispanic or Latino 
D. Asian or Pacific Islander 
E. American Indian or Alaskan Native 
F. Other 

The version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and in the 2007
state and local surveys was: 

How do you describe yourself? (Select one or more responses.) 
A. American Indian or Alaska Native 
B. Asian 
C. Black or African American 
D. Hispanic or Latino 
E. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 
F. White 

In the 2005 national survey and all 2007 surveys,
race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: (1) "Are you
Hispanic or Latino?" (response options were "yes" and "no"),
and (2) "What is your race?" (response options were "American
Indian or Alaska Native," "Asian," "Black or African
American," "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander," or
"White"). For the second question, students could select more
than one response option. For this report, students were
classified as "Hispanic" if they answered "yes" to the first
question, regardless of how they answered the second
question. Students who answered "no" to the first question
and selected more than one race/ethnicity in the second
category were classified as "More than one race." Students
who answered "no" to the first question and selected only one
race/ethnicity were classified as that race/ethnicity.
Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for students who did
not answer the first question and for students who answered
"no" to the first question but did not answer the second
question. 

CDC has conducted two studies to understand the effect of
changing the race/ethnicity item on the YRBS. Brener, Kann,
and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select
more than one response to a single race/ethnicity question on
the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ethnicity
among high school students. Eaton, Brener, Kann, and Pittman
(2007) found that self-reported race/ethnicity was similar
regardless of whether the single-question or a two-question
format was used.

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) 

This report draws upon data on teacher victimization from the
Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), which provides national-
and state-level data on public schools and national- and
affiliation-level data on private schools. The 1993 94,
1999 2000, and 2003 04 SASS were collected by the U.S. Census
Bureau and sponsored by the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES). SASS consists of four sets of linked
surveys, including surveys of schools, the principals of each
selected school, a subsample of teachers within each school,
and public school districts. In 1993 94, there were two sets
of teacher surveys, public and private school teachers. In
1999 2000, there were four sets of teacher surveys, public,
private, public charter, and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
school teachers. In 2003 04, there were three sets of teacher
surveys, public (including public charter), private, and BIA.
For this report, BIA and public charter schools are included
with public schools. 

The public school sampling frames for the 1993 94, 1999 2000,
and 2003 04 SASS were created using the 1991 92, 1997 98, and
2001 02 NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) Public School Universe
Files, respectively. In SASS, a school was defined as an
institution or part of an institution that provides classroom
instruction to students; has one or more teachers to provide
instruction; serves students in one or more of grades 1 12 or
the ungraded equivalent and is located in one or more
buildings. It was possible for two or more schools to share
the same building; in this case they were treated as
different schools if they had different administrations
(i.e., principals). Since CCD and SASS differ in scope and
their definition of a school, some records were deleted,
added, or modified in order to provide better coverage and a
more efficient sample design for SASS. Data were collected by
multistage sampling, which began with the selection of
schools. 

This report uses 1993 94, 1999 2000, and 2003 04 SASS data.
Approximately 10,000 public schools and 3,300 private schools
were selected to participate in the 1993 94 SASS, 11,100
public schools (9,900 public schools, 100 BIA-funded schools,
and 1,100 charter schools) and 3,600 private schools were
selected to participate in the 1999 2000 SASS, and 10,400
public schools (10,200 public schools and 200 BIA-funded
schools) and 3,600 private schools were selected to
participate in the 2003 04 SASS. Within each school, teachers
selected were further stratified into one of five teacher
types in the following hierarchy: (1) Asian or Pacific
Islander; (2) American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; (3) teachers
who teach classes designed for students with limited English
proficiency; (4) teachers in their first, second, or third
year of teaching; and (5) teachers not classified in any of
the other groups. Within each teacher stratum, teachers were
selected systematically with equal probability. In 1993 94,
approximately 57,000 public school teachers and 11,500
private school teachers were sampled. In 1999 2000, 56,300
public school teachers, 500 BIA teachers, 4,400 public
charter school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers
were sampled. In 2003 04, 52,500 public school teachers, 700
BIA teachers, and 10,000 private school teachers were
sampled. 

This report focuses on responses from teachers. The overall
weighted response rate for public school teachers in 1993 94
was 88 percent. In 1999 2000, the overall weighted response
rates were 77 percent for public school teachers, and 86 and
72 percent for BIA and public charter school teachers,
respectively (which are included with public school teachers
for this report). In 2003 04, the overall weighted response
rates were 76 percent for public school teachers and 86
percent for BIA-funded school teachers (who are included with
public school teachers). For private school teachers, the
overall weighted response rates were 80 percent, 67 percent,
and 70 percent in 1993 94, 1999 2000, and 2003 04,
respectively. Values were imputed for questionnaire items
that should have been answered but were not. For additional

School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) 

The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) was conducted
by NCES in the spring of the 2005 06 school year. SSOCS
focuses on incidents of specific crimes and offenses and a
variety of specific discipline issues in public schools. It
also covers characteristics of school policies, school
violence prevention programs and policies, and school
characteristics that have been associated with school crime.
The survey was conducted with a nationally representative
sample of regular public primary, middle, high, and combined
schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 

The sampling frame for the 2005 06 SSOCS was constructed from
the 2003 04 NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) Public
Elementary/Secondary School Universe File. The CCD is an
annual national database of all public K 12 schools and
school districts. Certain types of schools were excluded from
the CCD Public School Universe File in order to meet the
sampling needs of SSOCS, including those in the outlying U.S.
areas ***(Footnote 2 "U.S. outlying areas" include the
following: America Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands).***
 and Puerto Rico; overseas Department of Defense schools;
newly closed schools, home schools, and schools with high
grades of kindergarten or lower; special education,
vocational, or alternative schools; schools sponsored by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs; ungraded schools; and "intermediate
units"***(Footnote 3 These are generally schools specializing
in special education, alternative education, or juvenile
halls).*** in California and Pennsylvania. The sample was
stratified by instructional level, type of locale (e.g.,
city, urban fringe, etc.), and enrollment size. Within the
primary strata, schools were also sorted by geographic region
and by percentage of minority enrollment. In order to obtain
a reasonable sample size of lower enrollment schools while
giving a higher probability of selection to higher enrollment
schools, the sample was allocated to each subgroup in
proportion to the sum of the square roots of the total
student enrollment in each school in that stratum. A total of
3,565 schools were selected for the study. In March 2006,
questionnaires were mailed to school principals, who were
asked to complete the survey or to have it completed by the
person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at the
school. A total of 2,724 schools completed the survey. The
weighted overall response rate was 80.6 percent, and weighted
item nonresponse rates ranged from 0.0 to 27.7 percent. A
nonresponse bias analysis was conducted on the 13 items with
weighted item nonresponse rates above 15 percent, and the
detected bias was not deemed problematic enough to suppress
any items from the data file. Weights were developed to
adjust for the variable probabilities of selection and
differential nonresponse and can be used to produce national
estimates for regular public schools in the 2005 06 school
year. For information on the 1999 2000 and 2003 04
iterations, see Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2006.

Accuracy of Estimates

The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint
effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both types of
error affect the estimates presented in this report. Several
sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example,
members of the population of interest are inadvertently
excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse to
answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all
of the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes
are made during data editing, coding, or entry; the responses
that respondents provide differ from the "true" responses; or
measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail
to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure.
Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item
nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of
sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting
nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is
usually difficult. 

Sampling errors occur because observations are made on
samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of
population universes are not subject to sampling errors.
Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those
that would have been obtained by a complete census of the
relevant population using the same survey instruments,
instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a
statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it
indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a
particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two
sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of
the difference between the two statistics and to help
determine whether the difference based on the sample is large
enough so that it represents the population difference. 

Most of the data used in this report were obtained from
complex sampling designs rather than a simple random design.
The features of complex sampling require different techniques
to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected
using a simple random sampling. Therefore, calculation of
standard from the ones used when the data are from a simple
random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or
the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was used to
estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in
this report. 

Standard error calculation for data from the School Crime
Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation
method using PSU and strata variables available from each
dataset. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data,
standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the
U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized
variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent
the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated
using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. 

The coefficient of variation (CV) represents the ratio of the
standard error to the mean. As an attribute of a
distribution, the CV is an important measure of the
reliability and accuracy of an estimate. In this report, the
CV was calculated for all estimates, and in cases where the
CV was at least 30 percent the estimates were noted with a !
symbol (interpret data with caution). In cases where the CV
was greater than 50 percent, the estimate was determined not
to meet reporting standards and was suppressed.

Statistical Procedures 

The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical
significance to ensure that the differences are larger than
might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless otherwise
noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically
significant at the .05 level. Several test procedures were
used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the
nature of the statement being tested. The primary test
procedure used in this report was Student's t statistic,
which tests the difference between two sample estimates, for
example, between males and females. The formula used to
compute the t statistic is as follows: 
<equation> (1)

where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared and se1 and
se2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this
formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the
estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a
total percentage with that for a subgroup included in the
total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se1 * se2) must be
subtracted from the denominator of the formula:  

<equation> (2)

where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value was
computed, it was compared with the published tables of values
at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this
report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which has a t value
of 1.96. If the t value was larger than 1.96, then the
difference between the two estimates is statistically
significant at the 95 percent level. 

A linear trend test was used when differences among
percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of a
variable, rather than the differences between two discrete
categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for
example, the percentage of students using drugs increased (or
decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students
who reported being physically attacked in school increased
(or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with,
for example, student's age as the independent variable and
whether a student was physically attacked as the dependent
variable, the test involves computing the regression
coefficient (b) and its corresponding standard error (se).
The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t
is greater than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison
at the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is a linear
relationship between student's age and being physically
attacked is not rejected. 

Some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with
three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend
across all categories, rather than a series of tests between
pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among
percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered
categories, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for
a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this,
ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts
corresponding to successive levels of the independent
variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that
is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series
method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted
sample sizes were used to partition the total sum of squares
into within- and between-group sums of squares. These were
used to create mean squares for the within- and between-group
variance components and their corresponding F statistics,
which were then compared with published values of F for a
significance level of .05. Significant values of both the
overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term
were required as evidence of a linear relationship between
the two variables.

APPENDIX B: GLOSSARY OF TERMS

GLOSSARY OF TERMS

General Terms

Crime --Any violation of a statute or regulation or any act
that the government has determined is injurious to the
public, including felonies and misdemeanors. Such violation
may or may not involve violence, and it may affect
individuals or property. 

Incident -- A specific criminal act or offense involving one
or more victims and one or more offenders. 

Multistage sampling -- A survey sampling technique in which
there is more than one wave of sampling. That is, one sample
of units is drawn, and then another sample is drawn within
that sample. For example, at the first stage, a number of
Census blocks may be sampled out of all the Census blocks in
the United States. At the second stage, households are
sampled within the previously sampled Census blocks.
 
Prevalence -- The percentage of the population directly
affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based upon
specific information elicited directly from the respondent
regarding crimes committed against his or her person, against
his or her property, or against an individual bearing a
unique relationship to him or her. It is not based upon
perceptions and beliefs about, or reactions to, criminal
acts. 

School -- An education institution consisting of one or more
of grades K through 12. 

School crime -- Any criminal activity that is committed on
school property. 

School year -- The 12-month period of time denoting the
beginning and ending dates for school accounting purposes,
usually from July 1 through June 30. 

Stratification -- A survey sampling technique in which the
target population is divided into mutually exclusive groups
or strata based on some variable or variables (e.g.,
metropolitan area) and sampling of units occurs separately
within each stratum.
 
Unequal probabilities -- A survey sampling technique in which
sampled units do not have the same probability of selection
into the sample. For example, the investigator may oversample
minority students in order to increase the sample sizes of
minority students. Minority students would then be more
likely than other students to be sampled.

Specific Terms -- Used in Various Surveys

School-Associated -- Violent Deaths Surveillance Study 

Homicide -- An act involving a killing of one person by
another resulting from interpersonal violence. 

School-associated violent death -- A homicide or suicide in
which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a
functioning elementary or secondary school in the United
States, while the victim was on the way to or from regular
sessions at such a school, or while the victim was attending
or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event.
Victims included nonstudents as well as students and staff
members. 

Suicide -- An act of taking one's own life voluntarily and
intentionally. 

National Crime Victimization Survey 

Aggravated assault -- Attack or attempted attack with a
weapon, regardless of whether or not an injury occurs, and
attack without a weapon when serious injury results. 

At school (students) -- Inside the school building, on school
property (school parking area, play area, school bus, etc.),
or on the way to or from school. 

Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) -- Geographic entities
defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for
use by federal statistical agencies in collecting,
tabulating, and publishing federal statistics.

Rape -- Forced sexual intercourse including both psychological
coercion as well as physical force. Forced sexual intercourse
means vaginal, anal, or oral penetration by the offender(s).
Includes attempts and verbal threats of rape. This category
also includes incidents where the penetration is from a
foreign object, such as a bottle. 

Robbery --Completed or attempted theft, directly from a
person, of property or cash by force or threat of force, with
or without a weapon, and with or without injury. 

Rural -- A place not located inside the Metropolitan  

Statistical Area (MSA). This category includes a variety of
localities, ranging from sparsely populated rural areas to
cities with populations of less than 50,000. 

Serious violent crime -- Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or
aggravated assault. 

Sexual assault -- A wide range of victimizations, separate
from rape or attempted rape. These crimes include attacks or
attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual contact
between the victim and offender. Sexual assault may or may
not involve force and includes such things as grabbing or
fondling. Sexual assault also includes verbal threats. 

Simple assault -- Attack without a weapon resulting either in
no injury, minor injury, or an undetermined injury requiring
less than 2 days of hospitalization. Also includes attempted
assault without a weapon. 

Suburban -- A county or counties containing a central city,
plus any contiguous counties that are linked socially and
economically to the central city. On the data tables,
suburban areas are categorized as those portions of
metropolitan areas situated "outside central cities." 

Theft -- Completed or attempted theft of property or cash
without personal contact. 

Urban -- The largest city (or grouping of cities) in an MSA.
 
Victimization -- A crime as it affects one individual person
or household. For personal crimes, the number of
victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved.
The number of victimizations may be greater than the number
of incidents because more than one person may be victimized
during an incident. 

Victimization rate -- A measure of the occurrence of
victimizations among a specific population group. 

Violent crime -- Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, or simple assault. 

School Crime Supplement 

At school -- In the school building, on school property, on a
school bus, or going to or from school. 

Gang -- Street gangs, fighting gangs, crews, or something
else. Gangs may use common names, signs, symbols, or colors.
All gangs, whether or not they are involved in violent or
illegal activity, are included. 

Serious violent crime -- Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or
aggravated assault. 

Total victimization -- Combination of violent victimization
and theft. If a student reported an incident of either type,
he or she is counted as having experienced any victimization.
If the student reported having experienced both, he or she is
counted once under "total victimization."

Violent crime -- Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, or simple assault. 

Youth Risk Behavior Survey 

Illegal drugs -- Examples of illegal drugs were marijuana,
cocaine, inhalants, steroids, or prescription drugs without a
doctor's permission, heroin, and methamphetamines. 

On school property -- On school property is included in the
question wording, but was not defined for respondents. 

Rural school -- A school located outside a Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA). 

Suburban school -- A school located inside an MSA, but outside
the "central city." 

Urban school-- A school located inside an MSA and inside the
"central city." 

Weapon -- Examples of weapons appearing in the questionnaire
include guns, knives, and clubs. 

Schools and Staffing Survey 

City -- A territory inside an urbanized area (defined as
densely settled "cores" with populations of 50,000 or more of
Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled
surrounding areas) and inside a principal city (defined as a
city that contains the primary population and economic center
of a metropolitan statistical area, which, in turn, is
defined as one or more contiguous counties that have a "core"
area with a large population nucleus and adjacent communities
that are highly integrated economically or socially with the
core). 

Elementary school -- A school in which the lowest grade is
less than or equal to grade 6 and the highest grade is less
than or equal to grade 8. 

Elementary school teachers -- An elementary school teacher is
one who, when asked for the grades taught, checked: (1) only
"ungraded" and was designated as an elementary teacher on the
list of teachers provided by the school; (2) 6th grade or
lower or "ungraded," and no grade higher than 6th; (3) 6th
grade or lower and 7th grade or higher, and reported a
primary assignment of prekindergarten, kindergarten, or
general elementary; (4) 7th and 8th grades only, and reported
