Executive Summary
Introduction
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for teaching and 
learning, free of crime and violence. Any instance of crime 
or violence at school not only affects the individuals 
involved, but also may disrupt the educational process and 
affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding 
community (Henry 2000).

Ensuring safer schools requires establishing good 
indicators of the current state of school crime and safety 
across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring 
these indicators. This is the aim of Indicators of School 
Crime and Safety.

This report is the thirteenth in a series of annual 
publications produced jointly by the National Center for 
Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education 
Sciences (IES), in the U.S. Department of Education, and 
the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) in the U.S. 
Department of Justice. This report presents the most recent 
data available on school crime and student safety. The 
indicators in this report are based on information drawn 
from a variety of data sources, including national surveys 
of students, teachers, and principals. Sources include 
results from a study of violent deaths in schools, 
sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the National 
Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime Supplement to 
the survey, sponsored by the BJS and NCES, respectively; 
the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention; and the Schools and 
Staffing Survey and School Survey on Crime and Safety, both 
sponsored by NCES. The most recent data collection for each 
indicator varied by survey, from 2007 to 2009. Each data 
source has an independent sample design, data collection 
method, and questionnaire design, or is the result of a 
universe data collection. All comparisons described in this 
report are statistically significant at the .05 level. 
Additional information about methodology and the datasets 
analyzed in this report may be found in appendix A.

This report covers topics such as victimization, teacher 
injury, bullying, school conditions, fights, weapons, 
availability and student use of drugs and alcohol, and 
student perceptions of personal safety at school. 
Indicators of crime and safety are compared across 
different population subgroups and over time. Data on 
crimes that occur away from school are offered as a point 
of comparison where available.

Key Findings
In the 2008–09 school year, an estimated 55.6 million 
students were enrolled in prekindergarten through grade 12 
(Snyder and Dillow 2010). Preliminary data show that among 
youth ages 5–18, there were 38 school-associated violent 
deaths1 from July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009 (Indicator 
1). In 2008, among students ages 12–18, there were about 
1.2 million victims of nonfatal crimes at school,2 
including 619,000 thefts3 and 743,100 violent crimes4 
(simple assault and serious violent crime5) (Indicator 2). 
In 2009, 8 percent of students reported being threatened or 
injured with a weapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, on 
school property (Indicator 4). The following section 
presents key findings from each section of the report.

Violent Deaths
•	Of the 38 student, staff, and nonstudent school 
associated violent deaths1 occurring between July 1, 2008, 
and June 30, 2009, 24 were homicides, and 14 were suicides. 
From July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009, there were 15 
homicides and 7 suicides of school-age youth (ages 5–18) at 
school (Indicator 1).
•	During the school year 2007–08, there were 1,701 
homicides among school-age youth ages 5–18. During the 2007 
calendar year, there were 1,231 suicides of youth ages 5–18 
(Indicator 1).

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization
•	In 2008, students ages 12 to 18 were victims of about 
1.2 million nonfatal crimes (theft3 plus violent crime4) at 
school,2 compared to about 1 million nonfatal crimes away 
from school (Indicator 2).
•	The total at-school crime and theft victimization 
rates of students ages 12 to 18 declined between 2007 and 
2008. The total crime victimization rate of students ages 
12 to 18 at school declined from 57 victimizations per 
1,000 students in 2007 to 47 victimizations per 1,000 
students in 2008 (Indicator 2).
•	The rates for serious violent crimes5 were lower at 
school than away from school in 2008. In 2008, students 
ages 12 to 18 were victims of 4 serious violent crimes per 
1,000 students at school and 8 serious violent crimes per 
1,000 students away from school (Indicator 2).
•	In 2007, 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported 
being victimized at school during the previous 6 months: 3 
percent reported theft,3 and 2 percent reported violent 
victimization4 (Indicator 3). Less than half of a percent 
of students reported serious violent victimization.5
•	Eight percent of students in grades 9–12 reported 
being threatened or injured with a weapon, such as a gun, 
knife, or club, on school property6 in 2009. Specifically, 
3 percent of students were threatened or injured with a 
weapon one time, 2 percent were threatened or injured with 
a weapon two or three times, 1 percent were threatened or 
injured with a weapon four to eleven times, and 1 percent 
were threatened or injured with a weapon twelve or more 
times7 (Indicator 4).
•	In 2009, 10 percent of male students in grades 9–12 
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on 
school property in the past year, compared to 5 percent of 
female students (Indicator 4).  
•	During the 2007–08 school year, a greater percentage 
of teachers in city schools (10 percent) reported being 
threatened with injury than teachers in town schools (7 
percent) and suburban or rural schools (6 percent each) 
(Indicator 5). A greater percentage of teachers in city 
schools (5 percent) and suburban schools (4 percent) 
reported being physically attacked, compared to teachers in 
rural schools (3 percent).
•	A greater percentage of secondary school teachers (8 
percent) reported being threatened with injury by a student 
than elementary school teachers (7 percent) (Indicator 5). 
However, a greater percentage of elementary school teachers 
(6 percent) reported being physically attacked than 
secondary school teachers (2 percent).

School Environment
•	During the 2007–08 school year, 85 percent of public 
schools recorded that one or more incidents of crime had 
taken place at school,2 amounting to an estimated 2.0 
million crimes (table 6.1). This figure translates to a 
rate of 43 crimes per 1,000 public school students enrolled 
in 2007–08. During the same year, 62 percent of public 
schools reported an incident of crime that occurred at 
school to the police, amounting to about 704,000 crimes—or 
15 crimes per 1,000 public school students enrolled 
(Indicator 6).
•	In 2007–08, 75 percent of public schools recorded one 
or more violent incidents of crime,4 17 percent recorded 
one or more serious violent incidents,5 47 percent recorded 
one or more thefts,8 and 67 percent recorded one or more 
other incidents.9 Thirty-eight percent of public schools 
reported at least one violent incident to police, 13 
percent reported at least one serious violent incident to 
police, 31 percent reported at least one theft to police, 
and 49 percent reported one or more other incidents to 
police (Indicator 6).
•	During the 2007–08 school year, 25 percent of public 
schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a 
daily or weekly basis, and 11 percent reported that student 
acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse 
took place on a daily or weekly basis. With regard to other 
discipline problems reported as occurring at least once a 
week, 6 percent of public schools reported student verbal 
abuse of teachers, 4 percent reported widespread disorder 
in the classroom, 4 percent reported student racial/ethnic 
tensions, and 3 percent reported student sexual harassment 
of other students (Indicator 7).
•	Twenty percent of public schools reported that gang 
activities had happened at all during 2007–08 and 3 percent 
reported that cult or extremist activities had happened at 
all during that school year (Indicator 7).
•	In 2007, 23 percent of students ages 12–18 reported 
that there were gangs at their schools (Indicator 8). 
Overall, a smaller percentage of White students (16 
percent) and Asian students (17 percent) reported a gang 
presence at school than Black students (38 percent) and 
Hispanic students (36 percent).
•	The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who 
reported that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them 
decreased from 32 percent in 1995 to 23 percent in 2009 
(Indicator 9).
•	In 2009 in grades 9–12, higher percentages of 
American Indian/Alaska Native students (34 percent) and 
Hispanic students (31 percent) than Black students (22 
percent), White students (20 percent), and Asian students 
(18 percent) reported that drugs were made available to 
them on school property. In addition, smaller percentages 
of Asian students and White students than of students of 
two or more races (27 percent) reported that drugs were 
made available to them on school property (Indicator 9).
•	Ten percent of students ages 12–18 reported that 
someone at school had used hate-related words against them, 
and more than one-third (35 percent) reported seeing hate-
related graffiti at school in 2007 (Indicator 10).
•	In 2007, 32 percent of students ages 12–18 reported 
having been bullied at school during the school year 
(Indicator 11). Twenty-one percent of students said that 
they had experienced bullying that consisted of being made 
fun of; 18 percent reported being the subject of rumors; 11 
percent said that they were pushed, shoved, tripped, or 
spit on; 6 percent said they were threatened with harm; 5 
percent said they were excluded from activities on purpose; 
and 4 percent each said that someone tried to make them do 
things they did not want to do or that their property was 
destroyed on purpose.
•	In 2007–08, 34 percent of teachers agreed or strongly 
agreed that student misbehavior interfered with their 
teaching, and 32 percent reported that student tardiness 
and class cutting interfered with their teaching (Indicator 
12). Seventy-two percent of teachers agreed or strongly 
agreed that other teachers at their school enforced the 
school rules, and 89 percent reported that the principal 
enforced the school rules.
•	A higher percentage of secondary school teachers than 
elementary school teachers reported that student 
misbehavior (39 percent vs. 33 percent) and student 
tardiness and class cutting (45 percent vs. 26 percent) 
interfered with their teaching in 2007–08 (Indicator 12). 
During the same year, a lower percentage of secondary 
school teachers than elementary school teachers agreed that 
school rules were enforced by teachers (56 percent vs. 79 
percent) and by the principal in their school (86 percent 
vs. 89 percent).

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances
•	In 2009, 31 percent of students in grades 9–12 
reported they had been in a physical fight at least one 
time during the previous 12 months anywhere, and 11 percent 
said they had been in a fight on school property during the 
previous 12 months.6 Generally, a higher percentage of 
students in 9th grade reported having been in fights than 
students in any other grade, both anywhere and on school 
property. Generally, a smaller percentage of Asian students 
reported being in physical fights anywhere and on school 
property than students of other racial/ethnic groups. In 
addition, 4 percent of males said they had been in a fight 
anywhere twelve or more times, compared to 1 percent of 
females, and 1 percent of males said they had been in a 
fight on school property twelve or more times, compared to 
less than half a percent of females (Indicator 13).
•	Between 1993 and 2009, the percentage of students who 
reported carrying a weapon at least one day anywhere during 
the past 30 days declined from 22 percent to 17 percent, 
and the percentage who reported carrying a weapon at least 
one day on school property also declined, from 12 percent 
to 6 percent (Indicator 14).
•	In 2009, 27 percent of males carried a weapon 
anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females, and 8 percent 
of males carried a weapon on school property, compared to 3 
percent of females (Indicator 14).
•	 In 2009, about 42 percent of students in grades 9–12 
reported having at least one drink of alcohol anywhere in 
the past 30 days, while 4 percent had at least one drink on 
school property (Indicator 15).
•	Since 2003, there has been no measurable difference 
between the percentages of male and female students in 
grades 9–12 who reported alcohol consumption anywhere. 
However, there were differences in the reporting of how 
often alcohol was consumed in 2009. For example, a higher 
percentage of females than males reported consuming alcohol 
either one or two days out of the previous 30 days in 2009 
(23 percent vs. 18 percent). In addition, a higher 
percentage of males than females reported consuming alcohol 
from three to twenty-nine days (22 percent vs. 19 percent). 
One percent of male students reported consuming alcohol 
anywhere all thirty days (figure 15.2 and table 15.3). In 
terms of alcohol use on school property, males reported 
using alcohol at least one time during the previous 30 days 
at a greater percentage than did females in every survey 
year (Indicator 15).
•	In 2009, 21 percent of students in grades 9–12 
reported using marijuana anywhere in the past 30 days, 
while 5 percent reported using marijuana on school 
property. According to students’ reports, male students 
were twice as likely as females to use marijuana on school 
property (6 percent vs. 3 percent, respectively). Six 
percent of male students reported using marijuana anywhere 
40 times or more during the previous 30 days, compared to 2 
percent of females. One percent of males reported using 
marijuana on school property 40 times or more, compared to 
less than one-half percent of females (Indicator 16).
•	Generally among 9th–12th-graders, the percentage of 
Asian students reporting using marijuana anywhere and on 
school property during the previous 30 days was smaller 
than that of most other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, 
the percentage of students reporting using marijuana 
anywhere increased with grade level: a smaller percentage 
of 9th-graders reported using marijuana anywhere (16 
percent), than 10th-graders (21 percent), 11th-graders (23 
percent), and 12th-graders (25 percent) (Indicator 16).

Fear and Avoidance
•	In 2007, approximately 5 percent of students ages 12–
18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm at 
school, and 3 percent reported that they were afraid of 
attack or harm away from school (Indicator 17). In 2007, 
smaller percentages of White students (4 percent) and Asian 
students (2 percent) reported being afraid of attack or 
harm at school than their Black (9 percent) and Hispanic (7 
percent) peers.
•	 In 2007, 7 percent of students ages 12–18 reported 
that they had avoided a school activity or one or more 
places in school in the previous 6 months because of fear 
of attack or harm: 3 percent of students avoided a school 
activity, and 6 percent avoided one or more places in 
school (Indicator 18).

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures
•	Forty-six percent of public schools (approximately 
38,500 schools) took at least one serious disciplinary 
action against a student during the 2007–08 school year. Of 
the 767,900 serious disciplinary actions taken, 76 percent 
were suspensions for 5 days or more, 19 percent were 
transfers to specialized schools, and 5 percent were 
removals with no services for the remainder of the school 
year (Indicator 19).
•	Although the overall percentage of public schools 
taking a serious disciplinary action declined between 1999–
2000 (54 percent) and 2003–04 (46 percent), there has been 
no measurable change since then. This same general pattern 
of decline between the period of 1999–2000 and 2003–04 with 
no measurable change in more recent survey years held both 
for the percentage of public schools that reported taking 
serious disciplinary actions for the offense of physical 
attacks or fights and for the offense of insubordination 
(Indicator 19).
•	Between the 1999–2000 and 2007–08 school years, there 
was an increase in the percentage of public schools 
reporting the use of the following safety and security 
measures: controlled access to the building during school 
hours (from 75 percent to 90 percent); controlled access to 
school grounds during school hours (from 34 percent to 43 
percent); students required to wear badges or picture IDs  
(from 4 percent to 8 percent); faculty required to wear 
badges or picture IDs (from 25 percent to 58 percent); the 
use of one or more security cameras to monitor school (from 
19 percent to 55 percent); the provision of telephones in 
most classrooms (from 45 percent to 72 percent); and the 
requirement that students wear uniforms (from 12 percent to 
18 percent) (Indicator 20).
•	Between the 2003–04 and 2007–08 school years, there 
was an increase in the percentage of public schools 
reporting the drug testing of student athletes (from 4 
percent to 6 percent), as well as an increase in the 
percentage of public schools reporting the drug testing of 
students in other extracurricular activities (from 3 
percent to 4 percent) (Indicator 20).
•	During the 2007–08 school year, 43 percent of public 
schools reported that they had an electronic notification 
system for a school-wide emergency, and 31 percent of 
public schools reported that they had a structured, 
anonymous threat reporting system (Indicator 20).
•	The majority of students ages 12–18 reported that 
their school had a student code of conduct (96 percent) and 
a requirement that visitors sign in (94 percent) in 2007 
(Indicator 21). Metal detectors were the least commonly 
observed security measure. Ten percent of students reported 
the use of metal detectors at their school.

1 School-associated violent death is defined as “a 
homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law 
enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on 
the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school 
in the United States.” Victims of school-associated violent 
deaths included students, staff members, and others who are 
not students.
2 “At school” includes inside the school building, on 
school property, or on the way to or from school.
3 Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all 
burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and 
completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does 
not include robbery in which threat or use of force is 
involved.
4 Violent crimes include serious violent incidents and 
simple assault.
5 Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, 
robbery, and aggravated assault.
6 “On school property” was not defined for survey 
respondents.
7 Subtotals do not add to total due to rounding.
8 Theft/larceny includes taking things worth over $10 
without personal confrontation. Please see appendix B for a 
more detailed definition.
9 Other incidents include possession of a firearm or 
explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; 
distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or 
alcohol; and vandalism.

Foreword

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2010 provides the 
most recent national indicators on school crime and safety. 
The information presented in this report is intended to 
serve as a reference for policymakers and practitioners so 
that they can develop effective programs and policies aimed 
at violence and school crime prevention. Accurate 
information about the nature, extent, and scope of the 
problem being addressed is essential for developing 
effective programs and policies.

This is the thirteenth edition of Indicators of School 
Crime and Safety, a joint publication of the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Center for 
Education Statistics (NCES). This report provides detailed 
statistics to inform the nation about current aspects of 
crime and safety in schools.

The 2010 edition of Indicators of School Crime and Safety 
includes the most recent available data, compiled from a 
number of statistical data sources supported by the federal 
government. Such sources include results from a study of 
violent deaths in schools, sponsored by the U.S. Department 
of Education and the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC); the National Crime Victimization Survey 
and School Crime Supplement to the survey, sponsored by the 
BJS and NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 
sponsored by the CDC; and the Schools and Staffing Survey 
and School Survey on Crime and Safety, both sponsored by 
NCES.

The entire report is available on the Internet 
(http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/ 
crimeindicators2010/). The Bureau of Justice Statistics and 
the National Center for Education Statistics continue to 
work together in order to provide timely and complete data 
on the issues of school-related violence and safety.

Introduction
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for teaching and 
learning free of crime and violence. Any instance of crime 
or violence at school not only affects the individuals 
involved but also may disrupt the educational process and 
affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding 
community (Henry 2000). For both students and teachers, 
victimization at school can have lasting effects. In 
addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and 
adjustment difficulties (Crick and Bigbee 1998; Crick and 
Grotpeter 1996; Nansel et al. 2001; Prinstein, Boergers, 
and Vernberg 2001; Storch et al. 2003), victimized children 
are more prone to truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 
2003), poor academic performance (MacMillan and Hagan 2004; 
Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of school (Beauvais et 
al. 1996; MacMillan and Hagan 2004), and violent behaviors 
(Nansel et al. 2003). For teachers, incidents of 
victimization may lead to professional disenchantment and 
even departure from the profession altogether (Karcher 
2002; Smith and Smith 2006).

For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively 
address school crime, they need an accurate understanding 
of the extent, nature, and context of the problem. However, 
it is difficult to gauge the scope of crime and violence in 
schools given the large amount of attention devoted to 
isolated incidents of extreme school violence. Measuring 
progress toward safer schools requires establishing good 
indicators of the current state of school crime and safety 
across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring 
these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School 
Crime and Safety.

Purpose and Organization of This Report 
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2010 is the 
thirteenth in a series of reports produced since 1998 by 
the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) that present the most 
recent data available on school crime and student safety. 
The report is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation 
of school crime and safety information, nor does it attempt 
to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools. 
Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary of 
information from an array of data sources and to make data 
on national school crime and safety accessible to 
policymakers, educators, parents, and the general public.

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2010 is organized 
into sections that delineate specific concerns to readers, 
starting with a description of the most serious violent 
crimes. The sections cover Violent Deaths; Nonfatal Student 
and Teacher Victimization; School Environment; Fights, 
Weapons, and Illegal Substances; Fear and Avoidance; and 
Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures. Each section 
contains a set of indicators that, taken together, aim to 
describe a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. 
Where available, data on crimes that occur outside of 
school grounds are offered as a point of comparison.1 
Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more 
detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates. A 
glossary of terms and a reference section appear at the end 
of the report. Standard errors for the estimate tables are 
available online.

This year’s report contains updated data for eight 
indicators: violent deaths at school and away from school 
(Indicator 1), incidence of victimization at school and 
away from school (Indicator 2), threats and injuries with 
weapons on school property (Indicator 4), students’ reports 
of drug availability on school property (Indicator 9), 
physical fights on school property and anywhere (Indicator 
13), students carrying weapons on school property and 
anywhere (Indicator 14), students’ use of alcohol on school 
property and anywhere (Indicator 15), and students’ use of 
marijuana on school property and anywhere (Indicator 16).

Also found in this year’s report are references to recent 
publications relevant to each indicator that the reader may 
want to consult for additional information or analyses. 
These references can be found in the “For more information” 
sidebars at the bottom of each indicator.

Data
The indicators in this report are based on information 
drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including 
national surveys of students, teachers, and principals and 
universe data collections from federal departments and 
agencies, including BJS, NCES, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample 
design, data collection method, and questionnaire design, 
or is the result of a universe data collection.

The combination of multiple, independent sources of data 
provides a broad perspective on school crime and safety 
that could not be achieved through any single source of 
information. However, readers should be cautious when 
comparing data from different sources. While every effort 
has been made to keep key definitions consistent across 
indicators, differences in sampling procedures, 
populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all 
affect the comparability of results. For example, both 
Indicators 20 and 21 report data on selected security and 
safety measures used in schools. Indicator 20 uses data 
collected from a survey of public school principals about 
safety and security practices used in their schools during 
the 2007–08 school year. The schools range from primary 
through high schools. Indicator 21, however, uses data 
collected from 12- through 18-year-old students residing in 
a sample of households. These students were asked whether 
they observed selected safety and security measures in 
their school in 2007, but they may not have known whether, 
in fact, the security measure was present. In addition, 
different indicators contain various approaches to the 
analysis of school crime data and, therefore, will show 
different perspectives on school crime. For example, both 
Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent crime 
at school based on the National Crime Victimization Survey 
and the School Crime Supplement to that survey, 
respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of 
incidents of crime, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or 
prevalence of students who reported victimization. Figure A 
provides a summary of some of the variations in the design 
and coverage of sample surveys used in this report.

Several indicators in this report are based on self-
reported survey data. Readers should note that limitations 
inherent to self-reported data may affect estimates 
(Addington 2005; Cantor and Lynch 2000). First, unless an 
interview is “bounded” or a reference period is 
established, estimates may include events that exceed the 
scope of the specified reference period. This factor may 
artificially increase reported incidents because 
respondents may recall events outside of the given 
reference period. Second, many of the surveys rely on the 
respondent to “self-determine” a condition. This factor 
allows the respondent to define a situation based upon his 
or her own interpretation of whether the incident was a 
crime or not. On the other hand, the same situation may not 
necessarily be interpreted in the same way by a bystander 
or the perceived offender. Third, victim surveys tend to 
emphasize crime events as incidents that take place at one 
point in time. However, victims can often experience a 
state of victimization in which they are threatened or 
victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents 
may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may 
forget the event entirely or recall the specifics of the 
episode incorrectly. These and other factors may affect the 
precision of the estimates based on these surveys.

Data trends are discussed in this report when possible. 
Where trends are not discussed, either the data are not 
available in earlier surveys or the wording of the survey 
question changed from year to year, eliminating the ability 
to discuss any trend. For example, in Indicator 11, which 
reports on bullying using data from the School Crime 
Supplement survey, the 2007 questionnaire was revised to 
include information on cyber-bullying. Due to this change, 
the text of this indicator no longer presents trend 
information.

Where data from samples are reported, as is the case with 
most of the indicators in this report, the standard error 
is calculated for each estimate provided in order to 
determine the “margin of error” for these estimates. The 
standard errors of the estimates for different 
subpopulations in an indicator can vary considerably and 
should be taken into account when making comparisons. With 
the exception of Indicator 2, in this report, in cases 
where the standard error was at least 30 percent of the 
associated estimate, the estimates were noted with a “!” 
symbol (interpret data with caution). In Indicator 2, the 
“!” symbol cautions the reader that estimates marked 
indicate that the reported statistic was based on fewer 
than 10 cases. In cases where the standard error was 
greater than 50 percent of the associated estimate, the 
estimate was suppressed. See appendix A for more 
information.

The comparisons in the text have been tested for 
statistical significance to ensure that the differences are 
larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. 
Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report 
are statistically significant at the .05 level. Several 
test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data 
being analyzed and the nature of the statement being 
tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was 
Student’s t statistic, which tests the difference between 
two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted 
for multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests were used when 
differences among percentages were examined relative to 
interval categories of a variable, rather than the 
differences between two discrete categories. This test 
allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage 
of students who reported using drugs increased (or 
decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students 
who reported being physically attacked in school increased 
(or decreased) with age. When differences among percentages 
were examined relative to a variable with ordinal 
categories (such as grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
was used to test for a linear relationship between the two 
variables.

Although percentages reported in the tables are generally 
rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent), 
percentages reported in the text and figures are generally 
rounded from the original number to whole numbers (with any 
value of 0.50 or above rounded to the next highest whole 
number). While the data labels on the figures have been 
rounded to whole numbers, the graphical presentation of 
these data is based on the unrounded estimates shown in the 
corresponding table.

Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the 
datasets used in this report and a discussion of how 
standard errors were calculated for each estimate.

1 Data in this report are not adjusted to reflect the 
number of hours that youths spend on school property versus 
the number of hours they spend elsewhere.


Indicator 1
Violent Deaths at School and Away From School
The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school 
remained at less than 2 percent of the total number of 
youth homicides, and the percentage of youth suicides 
occurring at school remained at less than 1 percent of the 
total number of youth suicides over all available survey 
years.

Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events with 
far-reaching effects on the school population and 
surrounding community. In this indicator, data on school-
associated violent deaths are collected using the School 
Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD).

The most recent data collected for this survey covers the 
time period from July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009. 
During this time period, there were 38 school-associated 
violent deaths in elementary and secondary schools in the 
United States (figure 1.1 and tables 1.1 and 1.2). A 
school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, 
suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement 
officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus 
of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the 
United States.” Victims of school-associated violent deaths 
include not only students and staff members, but also 
others who are not students or staff members, such as 
parents. School-associated violent deaths include those 
that occurred while the victim was on the way to or 
returning from regular sessions at school or while the 
victim was attending or traveling to or from an official 
school-sponsored event. Of the 38 student, staff, and 
nonstudent school-associated violent deaths occurring 
between July 1, 2008, and June 30, 2009, 24 were homicides 
and 14 were suicides (table 1.2). Data for school-
associated violent deaths for the 2008–09 school year are 
preliminary.

Data on homicides and suicides at-school and away from- 
school were drawn from a number of sources, while ‘away-
from-school’ is added as a point of comparison. The 
availability for data on homicides and data on suicides at-
school and away-from-school differs in time period. The 
most recent data available for total suicides of school-age 
youth only (youth ages 5–18) are for the 2007 calendar 
year; the most recent data available for total homicides of 
youth ages 5–18 are for the 2007–08 school year. (Footnote 
2. Data on total suicides are available only by calendar 
year, whereas data on suicides and homicides at school and 
data on total homicides are available by school year. Due 
to these differences in reference periods, please use 
caution when comparing violent deaths at school to total 
violent deaths. Data for total suicides (2008) and total 
homicides (2008–09) are not yet available.)  During 2007–
08, there were 1,701 homicides of youth ages 5–18 (figure 
1.2 and table 1.1). During the 2007 calendar year, there 
were 1,231 suicides of youth ages 5–18. From July 1, 2008, 
through June 30, 2009, there were 15 homicides and 7 
suicides of school-age youth at school (figure 1.1 and 
table 1.1). In each year during the period 1992–93 to 2007–
08, there were at least 50 times as many homicides of youth 
away from school than at school and generally at least 150 
times as many suicides of youth away from school than at 
school. During the 2008–09 school year, there was 
approximately one homicide or suicide of a school-age youth 
at school per 2.5 million students enrolled.(Footnote 3. 
The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten 
through 12th grade during the 2008–09 school year was 
55,632,498 (Snyder and Dillow 2010).


The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school 
remained at less than 2 percent of the total number of 
youth homicides over all available survey years, even 
though the absolute number of homicides of school-age youth 
at school varied to some degree across the years (figure 
1.1 and table 1.1). Between the 1992–93 and 2008–09 school 
years, from 1 to 10 school-age youth committed suicide at 
school each year, with no consistent pattern of increase or 
decrease in the number of suicides. The percentage of youth 
suicides occurring at school remained at less than 1 
percent of the total number of youth suicides over all 
available survey years.




Indicator 2
Incidence of Victimization at School and Away From School
For students ages 12 to 18, the rates for serious violent 
crimes in 2008 were lower at school than away from school. 
The 2008 victimization rates for serious violent crimes 
were 4 per 1,000 students at school, and 8 per 1,000 
students away from school.

Theft and violence both at school and while going to and 
from school can affect the overall health and wellbeing of 
adolescents, interfere with educational goals, and stall 
normal healthy development (Fredland 2008). This type of 
victimization can also lead to higher than average rates of 
teacher turnover and increases in student dropout rates, 
students changing schools, and principals and teachers 
retiring early (Crews, Crews, and Turner 2008).

In 2008, data from the National Crime Victimization Survey4 
showed that more crimes were committed against students 
ages 12 to 18 at school than away from school. Students 
ages 12 to 18 experienced about 1.2 million nonfatal crimes 
(theft5 plus violent crime6) at school,7 compared to about 
1 million nonfatal crimes away from school (table 2.1).8 
These figures represent total crime victimization rates of 
47 crimes per 1,000 students at school and 38 crimes per 
1,000 students away from school.

Victimization rates of students ages 12 to 18 generally 
declined between 1992 and 2008. This pattern held for the 
total crime rate both at school and away from school as 
well as for the rates of the three components making up the 
total crime rate: thefts, violent crimes, and serious 
violent crimes. Between 2007 and 2008, the total crime 
rates against students ages 12 to 18 at school declined 
from 57 victimizations per 1,000 students to 47 per 1,000 
students. The rate of victimization by theft at school 
declined from 31 per 1,000 students ages 12 to 18 in 2007 
to 24 per 1,000 in 2008. There was no measurable difference 
in the rate of victimization by violent crime against 
students ages 12 to 18 at school between 2007 and 2008. 
Additionally, total crime, theft, and violent crime 
victimization rates away from school were not measurably 
different between 2007 and 2008.

Generally, between 1992 and 2007, the rate of theft at 
school among students ages 12 to 18 was higher than the 
rate of theft away from school. There were no measurable 
differences in these rates in 2008.
For most years between 1992 and 2005,9 the rate of violent 
crimes per 1,000 students away from school was either 
higher than the at-school rate or not measurably different 
from the at-school rate.
However, in 2007 the rate of violent crimes per 1,000 
students ages 12 to 18 at school was higher than the rate 
for those away from school. In 2008, there was no 
measurable difference.10

Rates of serious violent crimes11 against students ages 12 
to 18 at school were lower than those occurring away from 
school in each survey year between 1992 and 2008,6 except 
in 2007, when there was no difference detected. In 2008, 
students ages 12 to 18 were victims of 4 serious violent 
crimes per 1,000 students at school and 8 serious violent 
crimes per 1,000 students away from school.

In 2008, the victimization rates for students ages 12 to 18 
varied according to student characteristics. There were no 
measurable differences by age group (i.e., students ages 12 
to 14 vs. students ages 15 to 18) in the rates of total 
crime, theft, and violent victimizations at school (figure 
2.2 and table 2.2).
However, the rates of total crime, theft, violent, and 
serious violent victimizations away from school were lower 
for younger students (ages 12 to 14) than for older 
students (ages 15 to 18) (figure 2.2 and table 2.3). For 
example, the total crime victimization rate away from 
school was 25 per 1,000 students ages 12 to 14 and 49 per 
1,000 students ages 15 to 18. For students ages 12 to 14, 
violent victimization rates away from school were 12 per 
1,000, compared to 25 per 1,000 for students ages 15 to 18. 
The serious violent victimization rate away from school was 
4 per 1,000 students ages 12 to 14 and 11 per 1,000 
students ages 15 to 18. No measurable differences were 
detected by gender between the rates of thefts per 1,000 
students either at or away from school. Females had lower 
rates of violent crime victimization than males both at 
school and away from school in 2008.

4 Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on 
similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators 
differ with respect to time coverage and administration. 
For more information on these two surveys, please see 
appendix A.
5 Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all 
burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and 
completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does 
not include robbery in which threat or use of force is 
involved.
6 Violent crimes include serious violent crimes and simple 
assault.
7 “At school” includes inside the school building, on 
school property, or on the way to or from school.
8 “Students” refers to youth ages 12–18 whose educational 
attainment did not exceed grade 12 at the time of the 
survey.
An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have 
attended school during the survey reference period. These 
data do not take into account the number of hours that 
students spend at school or away from school.
9 There was a redesign of the methods used to measure 
victimization in the 2006 National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS). Due to this redesign, 2006 data are not 
presented in this indicator. For more information, please 
see appendix A.
10 The difference was not statistically significant at the 
.05 level, the level used to identify differences 
throughout the report.
11 Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, 
robbery, and aggravated assault.


Indicator 3
Prevalence of Victimization at School
In 2007, 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being 
victimized at school during the previous 6 months. About 3 
percent of students reported theft, 2 percent reported 
violent victimization, and less than half of a percent 
reported serious violent victimization.

Theft is the most frequent type of nonfatal victimization 
in the United States (U.S. Department of Justice 2007). 
Data from the School Crime Supplement12 show the percentage 
of students ages 12–18 who reported criminal victimization 
at school13 during the previous 6 months. In 2007, 4 
percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at 
school during the previous 6 months. About 3 percent of 
students reported theft,14 2 percent reported violent 
victimization15 (figure 3.1 and table 3.1), and less than 
half of a percent reported serious violent victimization.16

In 2007, the prevalence of victimization varied somewhat 
according to student characteristics. For all types of 
victimization, no measurable differences were detected by 
sex in the likelihood of reporting victimization. The 
percentage of students reporting victimization was higher 
for students in the 7th or 9th grade than for students in 
the 12th grade; however, no other measurable differences in 
the percentages reporting victimization were found across 
grades. In 2007, no measurable differences were detected in 
the percentages of White, Black, or Hispanic students who 
reported victimization, theft, or violent victimization. 
However, a higher percentage of students of other 
races/ethnicities than Hispanic students reported 
victimization, and a higher percentage of students of other 
races/ethnicities than White or Hispanic students reported 
violent victimization.

Some differences were also seen by school sector in the 
prevalence of victimization reported in 2007. A higher 
percentage of students in public schools reported 
victimization (5 percent) and theft (3 percent) than 
students in private schools (1 percent each).

Overall, the percentage of students ages 12–18 who were 
victimized at school decreased between 1995 and 2005 from 
10 to 4 percent. For each type of victimization, the 
percentage of students reporting victimization decreased 
between 1995 and 2005. Between the most recent survey years 
(2005 and 2007), there were no measurable changes in the 
percentage of students reporting any type of victimization.

12 Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on 
similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators 
differ with respect to time coverage and administration. 
For more information on these two surveys, please see 
appendix A.
13 “At school” includes the school building, on school 
property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to 
and from school.
14 Theft includes purse snatching, pick pocketing, all 
burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and 
completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does 
not include robbery in which threat or use of force is 
involved.
15 Violent victimization includes serious violent crimes 
and simple assault.
16 Serious violent victimization includes rape, sexual 
assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.


Indicator 4
Threats and Injuries With Weapons on School Property
From 1993 through 2009, the percentage of students who were 
threatened or injured with a weapon on school property 
fluctuated between 7 and 9 percent.

Every year, some students are threatened or injured with a 
weapon while they are on school property.
The percentage of students victimized in this way provides 
a measure of how safe our schools are, and if levels of 
safety in school have changed over time. In the Youth Risk 
Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked whether 
and how often they had been threatened or injured with a 
weapon on school property17 during the 12 months preceding 
the survey. From 1993 through 2009, the percentage of 
students who were threatened or injured with a weapon 
fluctuated between 7 and 9 percent. For example, in 2009, 8 
percent of students reported being threatened or injured 
with a weapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, on school 
property (table 4.1). Specifically, 3 percent of students 
were threatened or injured with a weapon one time, 2 
percent were threatened or injured with a weapon two or 
three times, 1 percent were threatened or injured with a 
weapon four to eleven times, and 1 percent were threatened 
or injured with a weapon twelve or more times18 (figure 4.3 
and table 4.3).

The likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon 
on school property varied by student characteristics, 
including sex and grade level. In each survey year, a 
higher percentage of males than females reported being 
threatened or injured with a weapon on school property 
(table 4.1). In 2009, the percentage of male students who 
reported being threatened or injured in the past year was 
nearly twice as high as the percentage of female students 
(10 and 5 percent, respectively). Generally, the percentage 
of students who reported being threatened or injured with a 
weapon on school property decreased with grade level 
(figure 4.1 and table 4.1). For example, in 2009, a smaller 
percentage of 12th-graders (5 percent) reported that they 
were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property 
than the percentages of 9th-, 10th-, and 11th-graders (9, 
8, and 8 percent, respectively).

The percentage of students who reported being threatened or 
injured with a weapon on school property varied by 
race/ethnicity in 2009 (figure 4.2 and table 4.1). 
Specifically, smaller percentages of White students and 
Asian students (6 and 5 percent, respectively) than 
American Indian/Alaska Native students (16 percent), and 
Black students and Hispanic students (9 percent each) 
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on 
school property. The percentage of American Indian/Alaska 
Native students who reported being threatened or injured 
with a weapon was higher than the percentages of Black 
students, Hispanic students, and students of two or more 
races (9 percent). In addition, higher percentages of 
Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students and students of 
two or more races (13 and 9 percent, respectively) than 
Asian students reported being threatened or injured with a 
weapon.

In 2009, the percentage of students being threatened or 
injured with a weapon on school property varied among the 
39 states for which data were available. Among these 
states, the percentage of students who reported being 
threatened or injured on school property ranged from 6 
percent in Indiana, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and 
Vermont to 12 percent in Arkansas (table 4.2).

17 “On school property” was not defined for survey 
respondents.
18 Subtotals do not add to total due to rounding.


Indicator 5
Teachers Threatened With Injury or Physically Attacked by 
Students
A greater percentage of teachers in city schools than 
teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported being 
threatened with injury during the 2007–08 school year.

Students are not the only victims of intimidation or 
violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats 
and physical attacks, and students from their schools 
sometimes commit these offenses. In the Schools and 
Staffing Survey, teachers were asked whether they had been 
threatened with injury or physically attacked by a student 
from their school in the previous 12 months. During the 
2007–08 school year, a smaller percentage of teachers, 7 
percent, were threatened with injury by a student from 
their school than in 1993–94 (12 percent) and 1999–2000 (9 
percent), though this percentage was not measurably 
different from the percentage in 2003–04 (7 percent) 
(figure 5.1 and table 5.1). The percentage of teachers 
reporting that they had been physically attacked by a 
student from their school, 4 percent, was not measurably 
different in 2007–08 than in any previous survey year 
(table 5.2).

A greater percentage of teachers in city schools than 
teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported being 
threatened with injury during the 2007–08 school year 
(figure 5.2 and table 5.1). Ten percent of teachers in city 
schools were threatened with injury by students, compared 
to 7 percent of teachers in town schools and 6 percent each 
of teachers in suburban and rural schools. A greater 
percentage of teachers in city schools (5 percent) and 
suburban schools (4 percent) than teachers in rural schools 
(3 percent) reported being physically attacked (table 5.2).

During 2007–08, teachers’ reports of being threatened or 
physically attacked by students varied according to the 
instructional level of their school. A greater percentage 
of secondary school teachers (8 percent) than elementary 
school teachers (7 percent) reported being threatened with 
injury by a student, and this pattern held for teachers in 
suburban schools as well as for teachers in rural schools 
(table 5.1 and figure 5.2). The apparent difference in the 
percentage of elementary and secondary teachers in city 
schools who reported being threatened with injury was not 
statistically significant. However, a greater percentage of 
elementary school teachers (6 percent) reported having been 
physically attacked than secondary school teachers (2 
percent), and this pattern held true for teachers in city, 
suburban, town, and rural schools (table 5.2).

A greater percentage of public than private school teachers 
reported being threatened with injury (8 vs. 3 percent) or 
physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent) by students during 
2007–08 (tables 5.1 and 5.2). Among teachers in city 
schools, there were at least five times as many public 
school teachers as private school teachers who reported 
being threatened with injury (12 vs. 2 percent) and at 
least four times as many public school teachers as private 
school teachers who reported being physically attacked (6 
vs. 1 percent).

In all survey years, a greater percentage of male teachers 
reported having been threatened with injury than female 
teachers (table 5.1). For example, in 2007–08, 9 percent of 
male teachers reported that they were threatened with 
injury by students, compared to 7 percent of female 
teachers; this pattern held true for teachers in city and 
suburban schools in 2007–08, as well.

Public school teachers’ reports of being threatened with 
injury or physically attacked varied among the states and 
the District of Columbia. During 2007–08, the percentage of 
public school teachers who reported being threatened with 
injury during the previous 12 months ranged from 3 percent 
in North Dakota to 17 percent in the District of Columbia 
(table 5.3), and the percentage who reported being 
physically attacked ranged from 2 percent in New Hampshire, 
New Jersey, North Dakota, and Ohio to 8 percent in Maryland 
(table 5.4).


Indicator 6
Violent and Other Crime Incidents at Public Schools and 
Those
Reported to the Police
In 2007–08, 75 percent of public schools recorded one or 
more violent incidents of crime, 17 percent recorded one or 
more serious violent incidents, and 47 percent recorded one 
or more thefts.

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school 
principals were asked to provide the number of violent 
incidents,19 serious violent incidents,20 thefts of items 
valued at $10 or greater without personal confrontation, 
and other incidents21 that occurred at their school;22 
public school principals were also asked to provide the 
number of incidents reported to the police. This indicator 
presents the percentage of public schools that recorded one 
or more of these specified crimes, the total number of 
these crimes recorded, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 
students. These data are also presented for crimes that 
were reported to the police. During the 2007–08 school 
year, 85 percent of public schools recorded that one or 
more of these incidents of violence, theft, or other 
crimes, had taken place, amounting to an estimated 2.0 
million crimes (figure 6.1 and table 6.1). This figure 
translates to a rate of 43 crimes per 1,000 students 
enrolled in 2007–08. During the same year, 62 percent of 
schools reported one of the specified crimes to the police, 
amounting to about 704,000 crimes—or 15 crimes per 1,000 
students enrolled. 

In 2007–08, a greater percentage of schools recorded an 
incident of crime than reported an incident of crime to the 
police. This pattern held true for violent crimes, serious 
violent crimes, thefts, and other crimes. Similarly, the 
rate of recorded incidents per 1,000 students was higher 
than the rate of incidents reported to the police per 1,000 
students; this held true for violent crime, serious violent 
crime, theft, and other crime. In 2007–08, 75 percent of 
schools recorded one or more violent incidents of crime, 17 
percent recorded one or more serious violent incidents, 47 
percent recorded one or more thefts, and 67 percent 
recorded one or more other incidents. In comparison, 38 
percent of public schools reported at least one violent 
incident to police, 13 percent reported at least one 
serious violent incident to police, 31 percent reported at 
least one theft to police, and 49 percent reported one or 
more other incidents to police.

The percentage of schools that recorded incidents of 
violent crime varied by school characteristics. For 
example, a smaller percentage of primary schools (65 
percent) than middle schools or high schools (94 percent 
each) recorded violent incidents of crime (table 6.2). 
However, the rate of recorded violent crimes per 1,000 
students was larger for middle schools (41 incidents per 
1,000 students) than for primary schools (26 incidents per 
1,000 students) or high schools (22 incidents per 1,000 
students). With regard to public schools that reported 
incidents of violent crime to the police, a greater 
percentage of high schools (75 percent) reported violent 
crimes to the police than middle schools (64 percent) or 
primary schools (20 percent) (table 6.3). There was no 
measurable difference between the rate per 1,000 students 
of reported violent incidents at high schools and middle 
schools (11 incidents per 1,000).

There was a range in the number of crimes recorded and 
reported by schools in 2007–08. One-quarter of schools 
recorded zero violent crimes, and 24 percent of schools 
recorded 20 or more violent crimes (figure 6.2 and table 
6.4). Sixty-two percent of schools did not report a violent 
crime to the police, compared to 5 percent of schools that 
reported 20 or more violent crimes to the police. In regard 
to serious violent crimes, 83 percent of schools did not 
record a serious violent crime, compared to 1 percent of 
schools that recorded 10 or more such crimes (table 6.5).

The range in the number of crimes recorded by schools 
varied by school characteristics. For example, a larger 
percentage of city schools recorded 20 or more violent 
incidents in 2007–08 than suburban schools, town schools, 
or rural schools (table 6.4). In 2007–08, 36 percent of 
city schools recorded 20 or more violent incidents, 
compared to 24 percent of suburban schools, 21 percent of 
town schools, and 14 percent of rural schools.

The percentages of public schools recording incidents of 
crime or reporting incidents of crime to the police in 
2007–08 were not measurably different from the percentages 
of schools doing so in 1999–2000 (figure 6.3 and table 
6.1). While this pattern held true for the percentage of 
public schools reporting violent incidents, as well as the 
percentage of schools recording and reporting serious 
violent incidents and thefts, there was an increase in the 
percentage of schools recording violent incidents over this 
period (from 71 to 75 percent) and a decrease in the 
percentage of schools recording other incidents during this 
period (from 73 to 67 percent).

19 Violent incidents include serious violent incidents; 
physical attack or fight without a weapon; and threat of 
physical attack without a weapon.
20 Serious violent incidents include rape or attempted 
rape; sexual battery other than rape; physical attack or 
fight with a weapon; threat of physical attack with a 
weapon; and robbery with or without a weapon.
21 Other incidents include possession of a firearm or 
explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; 
distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or 
alcohol; and vandalism.
22 “At school” was defined for respondents to include 
activities that happen in school buildings, on school 
grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-
sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed 
to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after 
normal school hours or when school activities or events 
were in session.

Indicator 7
Discipline Problems Reported by Public Schools
During the 2007–08 school year, 25 percent of public 
schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a 
daily or weekly basis, 11 percent reported that student 
acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse 
took place on a daily or weekly basis, and 6 percent 
reported that student verbal abuse of teachers occurred on 
a daily or weekly basis.

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school 
principals were asked how often certain disciplinary 
problems happen in their schools.23 This indicator examines 
the daily or weekly occurrence of student racial/ethnic 
tensions, bullying, sexual harassment of other students, 
verbal abuse of teachers, acts of disrespect for teachers 
other than verbal abuse, and widespread disorder in the 
classroom. It also looks at occurrences of gang and cult or 
extremist group activities, and, due to the severe nature 
of these incidents, presents any reports of gang and cult 
or extremist group activities that occurred during the 
school year.

During the 2007–08 school year, 25 percent of public 
schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a 
daily or weekly basis and 11 percent reported that student 
acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse 
took place on a daily or weekly basis (table 7.1). With 
regard to other discipline problems reported as occurring 
at least once a week, 6 percent of schools reported student 
verbal abuse of teachers, 4 percent reported widespread 
disorder in the classroom, 4 percent reported student 
racial/ethnic tensions, and 3 percent reported student 
sexual harassment of other students. Twenty percent of 
public schools reported that gang activities had happened 
at all during 2007–08 and 3 percent reported that cult or 
extremist activities had happened at all during this 
period.

Discipline problems reported by public schools varied by 
school characteristics. In 2007–08, a higher percentage of 
middle schools than primary schools reported various types 
of discipline problems (figure 7.1). For example, 44 
percent of middle schools compared to 21 percent of primary 
schools reported that student bullying occurred at least 
once a week. Also, a higher percentage of middle schools 
than high schools reported daily or weekly occurrences of 
student bullying. A greater percentage of high schools than 
middle schools reported any occurrence of gang activities 
or cult or extremist group activities during the school 
year.

In 2007–08, the percentage of schools reporting discipline 
problems was generally smaller for schools where 25 percent 
or less of the students were eligible for free or reduced-
price lunch than for schools where 76 percent or more of 
the students were eligible. For example, 13 percent of 
schools where 76 percent or more of the students were 
eligible for free or reduced-price lunch reported the daily 
or weekly occurrence of student verbal abuse of teachers 
compared to 3 percent of schools where 25 percent or less 
of the students were eligible. The percentage of students 
eligible for free or reduced-price lunch programs is a 
proxy measure of school poverty.

In 2007–08, a greater percentage of city schools than 
suburban schools, town schools, or rural schools reported 
student verbal abuse of teachers, student acts of 
disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse, widespread 
disorder in the classroom, and gang activities. For 
example, 8 percent of city schools compared to 2 to 3 
percent of suburban, town, or rural schools reported 
widespread disorder in the classroom. During the same 
school year, in general, the percentage of schools 
reporting discipline problems was higher in larger schools 
than in smaller schools. For example, 52 percent of schools 
with 1,000 or more students reported that gang activities 
occurred during the school year compared to 10 to 22 
percent of schools with fewer than 1,000 students who 
reported this discipline problem. The percentage of schools 
reporting that student verbal abuse of teachers occurred at 
least once a week was 6 percent in 2007–08, lower than the 
percentage in 1999–2000 (13 percent). There were some 
measurable changes in the percentage of public schools 
reporting selected discipline problems between the two most 
recent data collections, 2005–06 and 2007–08. A smaller 
percentage of public schools reported cult or extremist 
activities in 2007–08 (3 percent) than in 2005–06 (4 
percent). However, a larger percentage of public schools 
reported widespread disorder in the classroom in 2007–08 
than in 2005–06 (4 vs. 2 percent), and a larger percentage 
reported gang activities in 2007–08 than in 2005–06 (20 vs. 
17 percent).

23 “At school” was defined for respondents to include 
activities that happen in school buildings, on school 
grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-
sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed 
to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after 
normal school hours or when school activities or events 
were in session.


Indicator 8
Students’ Reports of Gangs at School
In 2007, about 23 percent of students reported that gangs 
were present at their school.

Gangs are organized groups often involved in drugs, weapons 
trafficking, and violence. Gangs at school can be 
disruptive to the school environment because their presence 
may incite fear among students and increase the level of 
school violence (Laub and Lauritsen 1998). In the School 
Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization 
Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked if gangs were 
present at their school.24

In 2007, 23 percent of students reported that there were 
gangs at their schools during the school year (figure 8.1 
and table 8.1). During the same year, a greater percentage 
of male students (25 percent) than female students (21 
percent) reported a gang presence at their schools. 
Overall, a smaller percentage of White students (16 
percent) and Asian students (17 percent) reported a gang 
presence at school than Black students (38 percent) and 
Hispanic students (36 percent) in 2007.

Generally, a smaller percentage of 6th-, 7th-, and 8th-
graders reported a gang presence at their school than 9th-, 
10th-, 11th-, and 12th-graders. In 2007, between 15 and 21 
percent of 6th-, 7th-, and 8th-graders reported a gang 
presence at school compared to 24 to 28 percent of students 
in the higher grades. In 2007, a higher percentage of 
students attending public schools (25 percent) reported a 
gang presence at school than students attending private 
schools (5 percent).

The total percentage of students who reported the presence 
of gangs at school was higher in 2005 (24 percent) than in 
2003 (21 percent); however there was no measurable change 
in the percentage of students who reported the presence of 
gangs at school between the two most recent survey years 
(2005 and 2007) (figure 8.2 and table 8.1).

24 “At school” includes the school building, on school 
property, on a school bus, or going to and from school.

Indicator 9
Students’ Reports of Drug Availability on School Property
The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported that 
drugs were offered, sold, or given to them decreased from 
32 percent in 1995 to 23 percent in 2009.

In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 
were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or given them 
an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months before 
the survey.25 The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who 
reported that drugs were made available to them on school 
property increased from 1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 
percent), but subsequently decreased to 23 percent in 2009 
(table 9.1). There was no statistically significant 
difference, however, between the 2009 percentage and the 
2007 percentage (22 percent) (table 9.1 and figure 9.1).

Student reports of the availability of drugs on school 
property varied by student characteristics. A higher 
percentage of males than females reported that drugs were 
offered, sold, or given to them on school property in each 
survey year from 1993 to 2009 (figure 9.1 and table 9.1). 
For example, in 2009, 26 percent of males reported that 
drugs were made available to them, compared to 19 percent 
of females. There were no measurable differences across 
grades in the percentages of students reporting that drugs 
were made available to them in 2009. Twenty-four percent of 
10th- and 11th-graders, 22 percent of 9th-graders and 21 
percent of 12th-graders reported that drugs were made 
available to them.

The percentage of students who reported having illegal 
drugs offered, sold, or given to them on school property 
differed across racial/ethnic groups (figure 9.2 and table 
9.1). Specifically, in 2009, higher percentages of American 
Indian/Alaska Native students (34 percent) and Hispanic 
students (31 percent) than Black students (22 percent), 
White students (20 percent), and Asian students (18 
percent) reported that drugs were made available to them on 
school property. In addition, a higher percentage of 
students of two or more races (27 percent) than of Asian 
students or White students reported that drugs were made 
available to them on school property.

In 2009, student reports of the availability of drugs on 
school property varied across the 42 states for which data 
were available. Among these states, the percentage of 
students reporting that drugs were offered, sold, or given 
to them on school property ranged from 15 percent in Kansas 
to 36 percent in
Hawaii and Nevada (table 9.2).

25 “On school property” was not defined for survey 
respondents.


Indicator 10
Students’ Reports of Being Called Hate-Related Words and 
Seeing
Hate-Related Graffiti
In 2007, 10 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that 
someone at school had used hate-related words against them, 
and 35 percent had seen hate-related graffiti at school.

In the 2007 School Crime Supplement to the National Crime 
Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked if 
someone at school had called them a derogatory word having 
to do with their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, 
gender, or sexual orientation at school.26 Students were 
also asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at their 
school—that is, hate-related words or symbols written in 
classrooms, bathrooms, hallways, or on the outside of the 
school building. With regard to hate-related words, 
students were asked to specify the characteristic to which 
the word was directed.27 In 2007, 10 percent of students 
ages 12–18 reported that someone at school had used hate-
related words against them during the school year (figure 
10.1 and table 10.1). Thirty-five percent of students 
reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the 
school year.

In 2007, students’ experiences of being called specific 
types of hate-related words and seeing hate-related 
graffiti differed according to student and school 
characteristics. For example, a smaller percentage of 12th-
graders (6 percent) reported being targets of a hate-
related word than 6th-graders (12 percent); 7th-graders, 
8th-graders, and 9th-graders (11 percent each); and 10th-
graders (9 percent). A higher percentage of public school 
students than private school students reported being called 
a hate-related word (10 vs. 6 percent) and seeing hate-
related graffiti (36 vs. 19 percent). In 2007, a higher 
percentage of White students than Asian students reported 
seeing hate-related graffiti. However, no other measurable 
differences were found by race/ethnicity or by sex in the 
percentages of students who reported being called hate-
related words or seeing hate-related graffiti.

Between 2001 and 2007, the percentage of students who 
reported being the target of a hate-related word decreased 
from 12 to 10 percent. Between the two most recent survey 
years, 2005 and 2007, the percentage of students who 
reported being the target of a hate-related word was lower 
in 2007 (10 percent) than in 2005 (11 percent). There was 
no pattern of increase or decrease in the percentage of 
students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti between 
1999 and 2007. However, the percentage of students who 
reported seeing hate-related graffiti was smaller in 2007 
(35 percent) than in 2005 (38 percent).

With regard to the specific characteristic to which the 
hate-related word was directed, in 2007, 5 percent of 
students reported hate-related words concerning their race, 
3 percent reported words related to their ethnicity, 2 
percent each reported words concerning their religion or 
gender, and 1 percent each reported words related to their 
disability or sexual orientation (figure 10.2 and table 
10.2).

Students’ experiences of being targets of specific types of 
hate-related words in 2007 differed according to their sex 
and race/ethnicity (table 10.2). A greater percentage of 
female students than male students (3 vs. 1 percent) 
reported being called a gender-related hate word. However, 
a greater percentage of male students than female students 
reported being called hate-related words relating to race 
and ethnicity. Five percent of male students compared to 4 
percent of female students reported being targets of a 
hate-related word regarding race and 4 percent of male 
students compared to 2 percent of female students reported 
being targets of a hate-related word regarding ethnicity. A 
smaller percentage of White students (3 percent) reported 
being called race-related hate words than Black students (7 
percent), Hispanic students (6 percent), Asian students (11 
percent), and students from other race/ethnicities (8 
percent). Smaller percentages of both White students and 
Black students (2 percent each) reported hate-related words 
regarding their ethnicity than Hispanic and Asian students 
(7 percent each).

26 “At school” includes the school building, on school 
property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to 
and from school.
27 “Hate-related” refers to derogatory terms used by others 
in reference to students’ personal characteristics.

Indicator 11
Bullying at School and Cyber-Bullying Anywhere
In 2007, about 32 percent of 12- to 18-year-old students 
reported having been bullied at school during the school 
year and 4 percent reported having been cyber-bullied.

Both bullying and being bullied at school are associated 
with key violence-related behaviors, including carrying 
weapons, fighting, and sustaining injuries from fighting 
(Nansel et al. 2003). In the 2007 School Crime Supplement 
to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 
12–18 were asked if they had been bullied at school during 
the school year and if they had been cyber-bullied 
anywhere. Cyber bullying is included as a point of 
comparison and is distinct from bullying at school.28

In 2007, about 32 percent of students reported having been 
bullied at school during the school year (figure 11.1 and 
table 11.1).29 Twenty-one percent of students said that 
they had experienced bullying that consisted of being made 
fun of; 18 percent reported being the subject of rumors; 11 
percent said that they were pushed, shoved, tripped, or 
spit on; 6 percent said they were threatened with harm; 5 
percent said they were excluded from activities on purpose; 
and 4 percent each said that someone tried to make them do 
things they did not want to do and that their property was 
destroyed on purpose (figure 11.2 and table 11.1).

Of those students in 2007 who reported being bullied during 
the school year, 79 percent said that they were bullied 
inside the school, 23 percent said that they were bullied 
outside on school grounds, 8 percent said they were bullied 
on the school bus, and 4 percent said they were bullied 
somewhere else (figure 11.3 and table 11.2). Of students 
who reported being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on, 19 
percent reported being injured as a result. Of these 
students who had been bullied, 63 percent said that they 
had been bullied once or twice during the school year, 21 
percent had experienced bullying once or twice a month, 10 
percent reported being bullied once or twice a week, and 7 
percent said that they had been bullied almost daily 
(figure 11.4 and table 11.3). Thirty-six percent of 
students who were bullied notified a teacher or another 
adult at school about the event(s).

In 2007, about 4 percent of students reported having been 
cyber-bullied30 anywhere (on or off school property) during 
the school year (figure 11.1 and table 11.1). Two percent 
of students said that they had experienced cyber-bullying 
that consisted of another student posting hurtful 
information about them on the Internet; and 2 percent of 
students reported unwanted contact, including being 
threatened or insulted, via instant messaging by another 
student during the school year (figure 11.2 and table 
11.1).

Of the students in 2007 who reported cyber-bullying during 
the school year, 73 percent said it had occurred once or 
twice during that period, 21 percent said it had occurred 
once or twice a month, and 5 percent said it had occurred 
once or twice a week (figure 11.4 and table 11.3). Thirty 
percent of students who were cyber-bullied notified a 
teacher or another adult at school about the event(s).

Student reports of bullying and cyber-bullying varied by 
student characteristics. A greater percentage of female 
than male students reported being bullied at school and 
cyber-bullied anywhere during the school year (figure 11.1 
and table 11.1). In 2007, 33 percent of female students 
reported being bullied at school compared to 30 percent of 
male students. Five percent of female students reported 
being cyber-bullied anywhere compared to 2 percent of male 
students. A higher percentage of White students (34 
percent) reported being bullied at school in 2007 than 
Hispanic students (27 percent). In addition, a higher 
percentage of White students (34 percent) reported being 
bullied at school than Asian students (18 percent).

28 “At school” includes the school building, on school 
property, on a school bus, or going to and from school.
29 Bullying includes being made fun of; being the subject 
of rumors; being threatened with harm; being pushed, 
shoved, tripped, or spit on; being pressured into doing 
things did not want to do; excluded from activities on 
purpose; and having property destroyed on purpose.
30 Cyber-bullying includes students who responded that 
another student posted hurtful information about the 
respondent on the Internet; made unwanted contact by 
threatening or insulting the respondent via instant 
messaging; or made unwanted contact by threatening or 
insulting the respondent via Short Message Service (SMS) 
text messaging. The latter category did not meet 
statistical standards to be reported separately.


Indicator 12
Teachers’ Reports on School Conditions
In 2007–08, a greater percentage of public school teachers 
than private school teachers reported that student 
misbehavior, student tardiness, and class cutting 
interfered with their teaching.

Classroom disruptions are associated with lower student 
achievement for the offending student, as well as for that 
student’s classmates (Lannie and McCurdy 2007). In the 
Schools and Staffing Survey, public and private school 
teachers were asked if student misbehavior, student 
tardiness, and class cutting interfered with their 
teaching. During the 2007–08 school year, 34 percent of 
teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior 
interfered with their teaching, and 32 percent reported 
that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with 
their teaching (figure 12.1 and table 12.1). Teachers were 
also asked whether school rules were enforced by other 
teachers at their school, even for students not in their 
classes, and whether they were enforced by the principal. 
In 2007–08, 72 percent of teachers agreed or strongly 
agreed that other teachers at their school enforced the 
school rules, and 89 percent reported that the principal 
enforced the school rules (figure 12.2 and table 12.2).

The percentage of teachers who reported that student 
misbehavior, class cutting, and tardiness interfered with 
their teaching varied by teacher and school characteristics 
during 2007–08 (table 12.1). For example, a greater 
percentage of public school teachers than private school 
teachers reported that student misbehavior (36 vs. 21 
percent) and student tardiness and class cutting (33 vs. 18 
percent) interfered with their teaching. And a higher 
percentage of secondary school teachers than elementary 
school teachers reported that student misbehavior (39 vs. 
33 percent) and student tardiness and class cutting (45 vs. 
26 percent) interfered with their teaching.

A greater percentage of teachers in city schools compared 
to teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported 
that student misbehavior, tardiness, and class cutting 
interfered with their teaching in 2007–08 (figure 12.1). 
Forty percent of teachers in city schools, compared to 32 
percent of teachers in suburban schools, 34 percent of 
teachers in town schools, and 31 percent of teachers in 
rural schools reported that student misbehavior interfered 
with their teaching. Thirty-eight percent of teachers in 
city schools reported that student tardiness and class 
cutting interfered with their teaching, compared to 29 
percent of teachers in suburban schools, 32 percent of 
teachers in town schools, and 27 percent of teachers in 
rural schools who reported that these occurrences 
interfered with their teaching.

The percentage of teachers who reported that student 
misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated 
between 1987–88 and 1993–94; however, between 1993–94 and 
2007–08 this percentage decreased (from 41 to 34 percent). 
The percentage of teachers reporting that student tardiness 
and class cutting interfered with their teaching decreased 
between 1987–88 and 1993–94 (from 33 to 25 percent), but 
increased between 1993–94 and 2007–08 (from 25 to 32 
percent). There were no measurable differences in the 
percentage of teachers reporting that student misbehavior 
or tardiness and class cutting interfered with their 
teaching between the two most recent survey years, 2003–04 
and 2007–08.

The percentage of teachers who agreed that school rules 
were enforced by other teachers and by the principal varied 
by teacher and school characteristics. In every survey 
year, a higher percentage of elementary school teachers 
than secondary school teachers agreed that school rules 
were enforced by teachers and by the principal in their 
school (table 12.2). In 2007–08, 79 percent of elementary 
teachers, compared to 56 percent of secondary teachers 
reported that school rules were enforced by other teachers, 
and 89 percent of elementary school teachers, compared to 
86 percent of secondary teachers, reported that school 
rules were enforced by the principal.

Between 1987–88 and 2007–08, the percentage of teachers who 
agreed that school rules were enforced by other teachers 
fluctuated between 65 and 72 percent, and the percentage 
agreeing that rules were enforced by the principal varied 
between 84 and 89 percent, showing no consistent trends. 
There were no measurable differences in the percentage of 
teachers reporting that school rules were enforced by other 
teachers or by the principal between the two most recent 
survey years, 2003–04 and 2007–08.

In 2007–08, the percentage of public school teachers who 
agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior and 
student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their 
teaching and that school rules are enforced by other 
teachers and by the principal, varied among the 50 states 
and the District of
Columbia. For example, among these states and the District 
of Columbia, the percentage of teachers who reported that 
student misbehavior interfered with their teaching ranged 
from 59 percent of teachers in the District of Columbia to 
29 percent of teachers in Pennsylvania (table 12.3).


Indicator 13
Physical Fights on School Property and Anywhere
The percentage of students in grades 9 through 12 who 
reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased 
between 1993 and 2009, from 42 to 31 percent; this was also 
true for the percentage of students who reported being in a 
physical fight on school property, this percentage 
decreased from 16 to 11 percent.

Physical fights on school property are considered a high-
risk behavior that may disrupt a focused learning 
environment at school; and students involved in physical 
fights on school property may face difficulties succeeding 
in their studies (Payne, Gottfredson, and Gottfredson 
2003). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in 
grades 9–12 were asked about their general involvement in 
physical fights (referred to as “anywhere” in this 
indicator) during the preceding 12 months, as well as about 
their involvement in physical fights on school property.31 
Fights occurring anywhere are included as a point of 
comparison with fights occurring on school property. 
Overall, the percentage of students who reported being in a 
physical fight anywhere decreased from 42 percent in 1993 
to 31 percent in 2009. Similarly, the percentage of 
students who reported being in a physical fight on school 
property decreased between 1993 and 2009, from 16 to 11 
percent (figure 13.1 and table 13.1). Between the two most 
recent survey years, 2007 and 2009, the percentage of 
students in grades 9–12 who reported being in a fight 
anywhere decreased from 36 to 31 percent, but there was no 
measurable difference between these two survey years in the 
percentage of students who reported being in a fight on 
school property.

Students were also asked how often they were in physical 
fights during the past year. In 2009, 24 percent reported 
being in a fight one to three times, 5 percent were in a 
fight four to eleven times, and 3 percent were in a fight 
twelve or more times. Ten percent of students reported 
being in a fight on school property one to three times, 1 
percent were in a fight on school property four to eleven 
times, and less than 1 percent were in a fight on school 
property twelve or more times (table 13.2).

From 1993 through 2009, the percentage of students who 
reported being in a physical fight anywhere and on school 
property decreased for all four grade levels (grades 9 
through12) (figure 13.1 and table 13.1). Generally, a 
higher percentage of students in 9th grade reported being 
in fights than students in any other grade, both anywhere 
and on school property. For example, in 2009, 37 percent of 
9th-graders, compared to 33 percent of 10th-graders, 29 
percent of 11th-graders, and 25 percent of 12th-graders 
reported being in a fight anywhere. Similarly, 15 percent 
of 9th-graders, compared to 12 percent of 10th-graders, 10 
percent of 11th-graders, and 7 percent of 12th-graders 
reported being in a fight on school property in 2009. A 
smaller percentage of 12th-graders were involved in 
physical fights anywhere and on school property than any 
other grade.

The percentage of students who reported being in a physical 
fight differed by race/ethnicity in 2009 (figure 13.2 and 
table 13.1). Generally, a smaller percentage of Asian 
students reported being in physical fights anywhere and on 
school property than other racial/ethnic groups. In 
addition, smaller percentages of White students reported 
being in fights anywhere and on school property than Black, 
Hispanic, or American Indian/Alaska Native students. For 
example, 19 percent of Asian students reported being in a 
physical fight anywhere at least once during the previous 
12 months, compared to 28 percent of White students, 36 
percent of Hispanic students, 41 percent of Black students, 
and 42 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students. 
Eight percent of Asian students reported being in a fight 
on school property at least once during the previous 12 
months, compared to 14 percent of Hispanic students, 17 
percent of Black students, and 21 percent of American 
Indian/Alaska Native students.

For both males and females, the percentage of students who 
reported being in a fight anywhere was lower in 2009 than 
in 2007 (39 percent compared to 44 percent for males, and 
23 percent compared to 27 percent for females). While the 
percentage of students who reported being in fights on 
school property in 2009 was lower than in 2007 for females 
(7 percent compared to 9 percent), there was no measurable 
difference in the percentage who reported being in fights 
on school property for males. A greater percentage of males 
than females reported being in a higher number of physical 
fights both anywhere and on school property. For example, 4 
percent of males reported being in a fight twelve or more 
times in 2009, compared to 1 percent of females. One 
percent of males reported being in a fight on school 
property twelve or more times, compared to less than half a 
percent of females (figure 13.3 and table 13.2).

Data for 2009 were available for 41 states. Among these 
states, the percentage of students who reported being in a 
fight anywhere ranged from 23 percent in Maine to 37 
percent in New Mexico, while the percentage of students 
reporting being in a fight on school property ranged from 7 
percent in North
Dakota to 15 percent in Arkansas and New Mexico (table 
13.3).

31 “On school property” was not defined for survey 
respondents.


Indicator 14
Students Carrying Weapons on School Property and Anywhere
Between 1993 and 2009, the percentage of students in grades 
9–12 who reported carrying a weapon at least one day 
anywhere during the past 30 days declined from 22 to 17 
percent, and the percentage carrying a weapon on school 
property declined from 12 to 6 percent.

The presence of weapons at school may interfere with 
teaching and learning by creating an intimidating and 
threatening atmosphere (Aspy et al. 2004). In the Youth 
Risk Behavior Survey, students were asked if they had 
carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club in the past 
30 days (referred to as ‘anywhere’ in this report) or if 
they had carried one of these weapons on school property 
during the same time period.32 Weapon carrying anywhere is 
included as a point of comparison with weapon carrying on 
school property. In 2009, 17 percent of students in grades 
9–12 reported that they had carried a weapon anywhere on at 
least one day during the past 30 days: 8 percent carried a 
weapon anywhere on six or more days of the period, 6 
percent carried a weapon on two to five days of the period, 
and 4 percent carried a weapon on one day of the period 
(tables 14.1 and 14.2). As for the percentages of students 
who reported carrying a weapon on school property during 
the past 30 days, 6 percent of students reported that they 
had carried a weapon on at least one day of the period. 
This percentage was composed of 2 percent of students 
reporting carrying a weapon on school property on six or 
more days, 1 percent reporting carrying a weapon on two to 
five days, and 2 percent reporting carrying a weapon on one 
day.

The percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon 
anywhere in the past 30 days declined from 22 percent in 
1993 to 17 percent in 2009. In addition, from 1993 to 2009 
the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon 
on school property declined from 12 to 6 percent. However, 
the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon 
either anywhere or on school property was statistically 
unchanged from 2007 to 2009.

In every survey year, the percentage of males who reported 
they had carried a weapon, either anywhere or on school 
property was higher than the percentage of females doing so 
(figure 14.1 and table 14.1). In 2009, for example, 27 
percent of males carried a weapon anywhere, compared to 7 
percent of females, and 8 percent of males carried a weapon 
on school property, compared to 3 percent of females. 

The percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon 
anywhere or on school property varied according to 
students’ race/ethnicity (figure 14.2 and table 14.1). In 
2009, a smaller percentage of Asian students (8 percent) 
than of students from any other racial/ethnic group (the 
percentages for the other groups ranged from 14 to 21 
percent) reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the 
previous 30 days. In addition, the percentage of White 
students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere was higher 
than that of Black students (19 vs. 14 percent). A smaller 
percentage of Asian students (4 percent) reported carrying 
a weapon on school property than of Pacific Islander/Native 
Hawaiian students (10 percent), White students (6 percent), 
or Hispanic students (6 percent).

In 2009, the percentages of 9th- through 12th-grade 
students reporting carrying a weapon anywhere during the 
past 30 days ranged from 16 to 18 percent, whereas the 
percentages of 9th- through 12th-graders reporting carrying 
a weapon on school property during that time period ranged 
from 5 to 6 percent. However, there were no significant 
differences in the percentage of students who reported 
carrying a weapon anywhere or on school property by grade 
level.

State level data were available in 37 states for students 
who reported carrying a weapon anywhere and in 41 states 
for students who reported carrying a weapon on school 
property. In 2009, the percentage of students who reported 
carrying a weapon anywhere and on school property (varied 
among the states for which data were available (table 
14.3). Among these states, the percentage of students 
reporting carrying a weapon anywhere ranged from 10 percent 
in New Jersey and Rhode Island to 27 percent in New Mexico, 
while the percentage of students reporting carrying a 
weapon on school property ranged from 3 percent in New 
Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to 12 percent in 
Wyoming.

32 “On school property” was not defined for survey 
respondents.


Indicator 15
Students’ Use of Alcohol on School Property and Anywhere
In 2009, about 42 percent of students in grades 9–12 
reported having at least one drink of alcohol anywhere in 
the past 30 days, while 4 percent had at least one drink on 
school property.

Alcohol consumption on school property is an illegal 
behavior of students, that may lead to additional crimes 
and misbehavior (Kodjo, Auinger, and Ryan 2003). In the 
Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were 
asked whether they had consumed alcohol at all (referred to 
as “anywhere” in this indicator) during the past 30 days 
and if they had consumed alcohol on school property.33 In 
most states, purchase and consumption of alcohol anywhere 
publicly by students in grades 9–12 (as they are under the 
legal drinking age of 21) is illegal. Alcohol consumption 
anywhere is included as a point of comparison with alcohol 
consumption on school property. Overall, the percentage of 
students reporting alcohol consumption anywhere in the past 
30 days decreased from 48 percent in 1993 to 42 percent in 
2009. The percentage of students reporting alcohol 
consumption on school property in the past 30 days in 2009 
was not measurably different from the 1993 percentage 
(figure 15.1 and table 15.1).

In 2009, 20 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported 
using alcohol anywhere on one or two days during the past 
30 days. Twenty-one percent reported using alcohol anywhere 
from three to twenty-nine days during the past 30 days, and 
1 percent reported using alcohol anywhere all 30 days 
(table 15.2). In addition, 3 percent of students reported 
using alcohol on school property on one or two days during 
the past 30 days, 1 percent of students reported using 
alcohol on school property from three to twenty-nine days 
during the past 30 days, and less than one-half percent of 
students reported using alcohol on school property all 30 
days.

Since 2003, there has been no measurable difference between 
the percentages of male and female students who reported 
alcohol consumption anywhere (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). 
However, there were differences in the reporting of how 
often alcohol was consumed in 2009. For example, a higher 
percentage of females than males reported consuming alcohol 
either one or two days out of the previous 30 days in 2009 
(23 percent vs. 18 percent). However, a higher percentage 
of males than females reported consuming alcohol from three 
to twenty-nine days (22 percent vs. 19 percent). One 
percent of male students reported consuming alcohol 
anywhere all thirty days (figure 15.2 and table 15.2). In 
every survey year, a greater percentage of males reported 
using alcohol on school property than females (figure 15.1 
and table 15.1). For example, in 2009, 5 percent of males 
reported consuming alcohol on school property at least one 
time, whereas 4 percent of females did so. Two percent of 
male students reported consuming alcohol on school property 
from three to twenty-nine days in 2009, whereas 1 percent 
of female students did so (figure 15.2 and table 15.2).

In 2009, about one-half (52 percent) of 12th-graders 
reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least one time 
during the previous 30 days (figure 15.3 and table 15.1). 
This percentage was higher than the 2009 percentage of 9th-
graders (32 percent), 10th-graders (41 percent), and 11th-
graders (46 percent) who reported consuming alcohol 
anywhere at least one time during the previous 30 days. 
There also were differences in how often alcohol was 
consumed anywhere among the grades in 2009 (table 15.2). 
For example, a higher percentage of 12th-graders (27 
percent) than of 9th-graders (13 percent), 10th-graders (20 
percent), and 11th-graders (23 percent) reported consuming 
alcohol anywhere from three to twenty-nine days in the past 
30 days. In terms of alcohol use on school property in 
2009, there were no measurable differences in alcohol 
consumption among the grades.

Alcohol consumption anywhere and on school property also 
varied by racial/ethnic group. In 2009, a smaller 
percentage of Asian students than of students of any other 
racial/ethnic group reported consuming alcohol anywhere 
(figure 15.4 and table 15.1). In addition, a smaller 
percentage of Black students (33 percent) than of White 
students (45 percent) and Hispanic students (43 percent) 
reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least one time 
during the previous 30 days. Asian students were less 
likely to consume alcohol on school property (3 percent) 
than Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students (10 
percent), Hispanic students and students of two or more 
races (7 percent), and Black students (5 percent); however 
there was no measurable difference in the alcohol 
consumption on school property of Asian students and White 
students (3 percent each).

State level data were available in 42 states for students 
who reported drinking alcohol anywhere and in 38 states for 
students who reported drinking alcohol on school property. 
The percentage of students who reported drinking alcohol 
anywhere and on school property varied among the states for 
which data were available. Among these states, the 
percentage of students who reported drinking alcohol 
anywhere at least one day during the previous 30 days 
ranged from 18 percent in Utah to 47 percent in Louisiana, 
while the percentage of students who reported drinking on 
school property ranged from 3 percent in Alaska, Kansas, 
Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, and 
Vermont to 8 percent in Hawaii and New Mexico (table 15.3).

33 “On school property” was not defined for survey 
respondents.


Indicator 16
Students’ Use of Marijuana on School Property and Anywhere
In 2009, 21 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported 
using marijuana anywhere at least one time in the past 30 
days, while 5 percent reported using marijuana at least one 
time on school property.

The Youth Risk Behavior Survey asked students in grades 9–
12 whether they had used marijuana at all (referred to as 
“anywhere” in this indicator) in the past 30 days as well 
as whether they had used marijuana on school property in 
the past 30 days.34 According to students’ reports in 2009, 
students were four times more likely to use marijuana 
anywhere than on school property. Of students in grades 9–
12, twenty-one percent reported using marijuana at least 
one time anywhere in the past 30 days, while 5 percent 
reported using marijuana at least one time on school 
property in the past 30 days (figure 16.1 and table 16.1).

The percentage of students who reported using marijuana 
anywhere at least one time in the past 30 days was higher 
in 1999 (27 percent) than in 1993 (18 percent). Between 
1999 and 2009, the percentage of students who reported 
using marijuana anywhere had declined to 21 percent. 
However, there was no measurable difference between the 
percentage of students who reported using marijuana 
anywhere in 2005 and the percentage who reported using it 
anywhere in 2009. With regard to marijuana use on school 
property, the percentage of students who reported using 
marijuana decreased between 1993 and 2009. In 1999, 7 
percent of students reported using marijuana at least one 
time during the past 30 days on school property, and by 
2009 this percentage had declined to 5 percent (figure 16.1 
and table 16.1).

In every survey year, higher percentages of males than 
females reported using marijuana anywhere and on school 
property (figure 16.1 and table 16.1). For example, in 
2009, 23 percent of males reported using marijuana anywhere 
during the previous 30 days, compared to 18 percent of 
females. According to students’ reports, male students were 
twice as likely as females to use marijuana on school 
property in 2009 (6 percent vs. 3 percent, respectively). 
There were also differences between males and females in 
the reported number of times using marijuana in the past 30 
days. Six percent of males reported using marijuana 40 
times or more anywhere in the past 30 days, compared to 2 
percent of females. One percent of males reported using 
marijuana 40 times or more on school property, compared to 
less than one-half percent of females (figure 16.2 and 
table 16.2).

Student reports on marijuana use anywhere and on school 
property differed by racial/ethnic group in 2009. 
Generally, the percentage of Asian students reporting using 
marijuana anywhere and on school property during the 
previous 30 days was smaller than that of most other 
racial/ethnic groups (figure 16.3 and table 16.1). For 
example, 7 percent of Asian students reported using 
marijuana anywhere, compared to 21 percent of White 
students; 22 percent each of Black students, Hispanic 
students, and students of two or more races; 25 percent of 
Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students; and 32 percent 
of American Indian/Alaska Native students. Similarly, a 
smaller percentage of Asian students (2 percent) reported 
using marijuana on school property than White students (4 
percent), students of two or more races (5 percent), Black 
students and Hispanic students (6 percent each), and 
Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students (9 percent). 
There was no statistically significant difference between 
the percentage of Asian students and the percentage of 
American Indian/Alaska Native students reporting using 
marijuana on school property.

The percentages of 9th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students, 
who reported using marijuana anywhere in 2009 were lower 
than the percentages of students in those grades who used 
marijuana anywhere in 1999 (table 16.1). However, compared 
to a decade ago, there was no significant change in the 
percentage of 11th-graders who reported using marijuana 
anywhere. Lower percentages of students at each of grade 
levels 9 through 12 reported using marijuana on school 
property in 2009 than in 1999.

In 2009, a smaller percentage of 9th-graders reported using 
marijuana anywhere (16 percent), than 10th-graders (21 
percent), 11th-graders (23 percent), and 12th-graders (25 
percent) (figure 16.4 and table 16.1). There were no 
measurable differences between the percentages of students 
in any of the grades 9 thought 12 who reported the use of 
marijuana on school property in 2009.

State level data were available in 42 states for students 
who reported using marijuana anywhere and in 38 states for 
students who reported using marijuana on school property. 
The percentage of students who reported using marijuana 
anywhere and on school property, varied among the states 
for which data were available in 2009. Among these states, 
the percentage of students who reported using marijuana 
anywhere ranged from 10 percent in Utah to 28 percent in 
New Mexico, while the percentage of students who reported 
using marijuana on school property ranged from 3 percent in 
Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, 
Oklahoma, and South Dakota to 10 percent in New Mexico 
(table 16.3).

34 “On school property” was not defined for survey 
respondents.


Indicator 17
Students’ Perceptions of Personal Safety at School and Away 
From School
In 2007, approximately 5 percent of students ages 12–18 
reported that they were afraid of attack or harm at school, 
compared to 3 percent of students who reported that they 
were afraid of attack or harm away from school.

School violence can make students fearful and affect their 
readiness and ability to learn, and concerns about 
vulnerability to attacks detract from a positive school 
environment (Scheckner et al. 2002). In the School Crime 
Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 
students ages 12–18 were asked how often35 they had been 
afraid of attack or harm “at school or on the way to and 
from school” and “away from school.”36 In 2007, a greater 
percentage of students ages 12–18 reported that they were 
afraid of attack or harm at school (5 percent) than away 
from school (3 percent) during the school year (figure 17.1 
and table 17.1).

Students’ reports on their fears about their safety varied 
by location and race/ethnicity. For example, in 2007, 
smaller percentages of White students (4 percent) and Asian 
students (2 percent) reported being afraid of attack or 
harm at school than their Black (9 percent) and Hispanic (7 
percent) peers. Away from school, a smaller percentage of 
White students (3 percent) than Black students (5 percent) 
and Hispanic students (6 percent) reported being afraid of 
attack or harm.

Other differences in students’ reports on their safety were 
detected by student and school characteristics in 2007. For 
example, a higher percentage of 6th-graders (10 percent) 
reported being afraid of attack or harm at school than 7th-
graders (7 percent), 8th-graders (5 percent), 9th-graders 
(6 percent), 10th-graders (5 percent), and 11th- and 12th-
graders (3 percent each). Away from school, a larger 
percentage of 6thgraders (6 percent) were afraid of attack 
or harm than students in the 10th, 11th, or 12th grades (2 
to 3 percent).

A greater percentage of female students (6 percent) feared 
for their safety at school than male students (5 percent) 
in 2007. The same was true away from school: 5 percent of 
females feared for their safety compared to 2 percent of 
males.

School sector was also related to students’ fear of attack 
or harm. A greater percentage of students in public schools 
(6 percent) reported being afraid of being attacked or 
harmed at school than students attending private schools (2 
percent). There was no significant difference in the 
percentage of public and private school students who 
reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school.

Between 1995 and 2007, the percentage of students who 
feared attack or harm at school decreased from 12 to 5 
percent. Between the two most recent survey years, 2005 and 
2007, the percentage of students who feared attack or harm 
at school decreased from 6 percent to 5 percent. Away from 
school, there was no pattern of increase or decrease in the 
percentage of students who feared attack or harm between 
1999 and 2007. However, the percentage of students who 
feared attack or harm away from school was smaller in 2007 
(3 percent) than in 2005 (5 percent).

35 Students were asked if they “never,” “almost never,” 
“sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared attack or harm at 
school or away from school. Students responding “sometimes” 
or “most of the time” were considered fearful.
36 “At school” includes the school building, on school 
property, on a school bus.


Indicator 18
Students’ Reports of Avoiding School Activities or Specific 
Places in School In 2007, 7 percent of students ages 12–18 
reported that they avoided school activities or one or more 
places in school because they thought someone might attack 
or harm them.

School crime may lead students to perceive school as 
unsafe, and in trying to ensure their own safety, students 
may begin to skip school activities or avoid certain places 
in school (Schreck and Miller 2003). The percentage of 
students who avoid school activities and certain areas in 
school is a measure of their perception of school safety. 
In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime 
Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked 
whether they had avoided school activities or one or more 
places in school because they were fearful that someone 
might attack or harm them.37 In 2007, 7 percent of students 
reported that they had avoided a school activity or one or 
more places in school during the previous school year 
because of fear of attack or harm. About 3 percent of 
students avoided a school activity, and 6 percent avoided 
one or more places in school38 (figure 18.1 and table 
18.1).

While there was no overall pattern of increase or decrease 
between 1999 and 2007 in the percentage of students who 
reported that they had avoided a school activity or one or 
more places in school because they were fearful that 
someone might attack or harm them, the percentage was 
higher in 2007 (7 percent) than in 2005 (6 percent).

In 2007, 2 percent of students reported that they had 
avoided any activity, 1 percent of students reported that 
they had avoided a class, and 1 percent of students 
reported that they had stayed home from school because they 
were fearful someone might attack or harm them. One percent 
of students reported that they had avoided the entrance to 
the school, 3 percent that they had avoided the stairs or 
hallways, 2 percent that they had avoided parts of the 
school cafeteria, 3 percent that they had avoided any 
school restrooms, and 1 percent that they had avoided other 
places inside the school building because of fear of attack 
or harm in 2007.

Students’ reports of avoiding one or more places in school 
because of fear of attack or harm varied by student and 
school characteristics. A higher percentage of 7th-graders 
(7 percent), 8th-graders (6 percent), 9th-graders (7 
percent), and 10th-graders (5 percent) reported avoiding 
one or more places inside school than 12th-graders (3 
percent) (figure 18.2). Additionally, a higher percentage 
of 6th graders (8 percent), 7th-graders (7 percent), and 
9th-graders (7 percent) than 11th-graders (4 percent) 
reported avoiding one or more places in school because of 
fear of attack or harm. No measurable difference was 
detected in the extent to which females and males avoided 
one or more places in school in 2007 (5 and 6 percent, 
respectively).

A larger percentage of public school students (6 percent) 
than private school students (1 percent) reported avoiding 
one or more places inside school because of fear of attack 
or harm.

37 For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed from 
“attack or harm” to “attack or threat of attack.” See 
appendix A for more information.
38 “Avoided school activities” includes avoiding any 
(extracurricular) activities, skipping class, or staying 
home from school. In 2007, the survey wording was changed 
from “any extracurricular activities” to “any activities.” 
Please use caution when comparing changes in this item over 
time. Avoiding one or more places in school includes the 
entrance, any hallways or stairs, parts of the cafeteria, 
restrooms, and other places inside the school building.


Indicator 19
Serious Disciplinary Actions Taken by Public Schools
Forty-six percent of public schools (approximately 38,500 
schools) took a serious disciplinary action against a 
student for specific offenses during the 2007–08 school 
year. Approximately 767,900 serious disciplinary actions 
were taken by public schools during that period.

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school 
principals were asked to report the number of disciplinary 
actions their schools took against students for specific 
offenses. The offenses included physical attacks or fights; 
insubordination; distribution, possession, or use of 
alcohol; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; 
use or possession of a firearm or explosive device; and use 
or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive 
device.

Forty-six percent of public schools (approximately 38,500 
schools) took at least one serious disciplinary action 
against a student—including suspensions lasting 5 days or 
more, removals with no services (i.e., expulsions), and 
transfers to specialized schools—for specific offenses 
during the 2007–08 school year (table 19.1).

The largest percentage of schools that reported taking a 
disciplinary action in 2007–08 did so in response to a 
physical attack or fight: 31 percent of schools took a 
serious disciplinary action for physical attacks or fights 
(figure 19.1 and table 19.1). In response to other 
offenses, 21 percent of all schools took serious 
disciplinary action for insubordination; 19 percent for 
distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; 15 
percent took action as a result of use or possession of a 
weapon other than a firearm or explosive device; 10 percent 
did so for distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; and 
3 percent did so for use or possession of a firearm or 
explosive device.

A total of 767,900 serious disciplinary actions were taken 
during the 2007–08 school year. The largest number of 
disciplinary actions were taken for insubordination 
(327,100 actions) and physical attacks or fights (271,800). 
A smaller number of disciplinary actions were taken in 
response to the use or possession of a firearm or explosive 
device (5,200 actions) than for other offenses covered in 
the survey.

Of the 767,900 serious disciplinary actions taken during 
the 2007–08 school year, 76 percent were suspensions for 5 
days or more, 19 percent were transfers to specialized 
schools, and 5 percent were removals with no services for 
the remainder of the school year (figure 19.2). Although 
the most common disciplinary action taken was suspensions 
lasting 5 days or more, differences in serious disciplinary 
actions taken varied by the type of offense. Generally, 
greater percentages of out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 
days or more were in response to insubordination (82 
percent); physical attacks or fights (79 percent); and the 
distribution, possession, or use of alcohol (74 percent) 
than were in response to the other offenses covered in the 
survey (ranging from 53 to 60 percent). Greater percentages 
of removals with no services for the remainder of the 
school year were in response to the use or possession of a 
firearm or explosive device (18 percent); distribution, 
possession, or use of illegal drugs (9 percent); and use or 
possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive 
device (8 percent) than were in response to the other 
offenses covered in the survey (ranging from 4 to 5 
percent). Greater percentages of transfers to specialized 
schools were in response to the distribution, possession, 
or use of illegal drugs (36 percent); the use or possession 
of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device (32 
percent); and the use or possession of firearm or explosive 
device (29 percent) than were in response to the other 
offenses covered in the survey (ranging from 13 to 22 
percent).

Although the overall percentage of schools taking a serious 
disciplinary action was lower in 2003–04 (46 percent) than 
in 1999–2000 (54 percent), there has been no measurable 
change since 2003–04 (figure 19.3 and table 19.2). This 
same general pattern held both for the percentage of 
schools taking serious disciplinary actions for the offense 
of physical attacks or fights and for the offense of 
insubordination.

Between the two most recent survey years (2005–06 and 2007–
08), there was no measurable difference in the percentage 
of schools that took a serious disciplinary action in 
response to the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol 
or illegal drugs. A smaller percentage of schools reported 
taking a serious disciplinary action for the use or 
possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive 
device in 2007–08 (15 percent) than in 2005–06 (19 
percent). Similarly, a smaller percentage of schools 
reported taking a serious disciplinary action for the use 
or possession of a firearm or explosive device in 2007–08 
(3 percent) than in 2005–06 (5 percent).


Indicator 20
Safety and Security Measures Taken by Public Schools
During the 2007–08 school year, 43 percent of public 
schools reported that they had an electronic notification 
system for a school-wide emergency and 31 percent of public 
schools reported that they had a structured, anonymous 
threat reporting system.

Public schools use a variety of practices and procedures 
intended to promote the safety of students and staff. In 
the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school 
principals were asked about their school’s use of safety 
and security measures and procedures. Certain practices, 
such as locked or monitored doors or gates, are intended to 
limit or control access to school campuses, while others, 
such as metal detectors, security cameras, and drug sweeps, 
are intended to monitor or restrict students’ and visitors’ 
behavior on campus.

In the 2007–08 school year, nearly all public schools 
required visitors to sign in or check in (99 percent) 
(table 20.1). Other frequently reported safety and security 
measures included prohibiting all tobacco use on school 
grounds (91 percent of public schools) and controlling 
access to school buildings by locking or monitoring doors 
during school hours (90 percent of public schools) (figure 
20.1 and table 20.1). Forty-three percent of public schools 
reported that they had an electronic notification system 
for a school-wide emergency and 31 percent of public 
schools reported that they had a structured, anonymous 
threat reporting system. One percent of public schools 
required students to pass through metal detectors daily.

The use of safety and security measures varied by school 
level during the 2007–08 school year. In general, a greater 
percentage of high schools than middle schools and primary 
schools, and a greater percentage of middle schools than 
primary schools, reported using the following safety and 
security measures: drug testing for athletes; drug testing 
for students in extracurricular activities;39 requiring 
students to wear badges or picture ID’s; daily metal 
detector checks on students;40 random dog sniffs to check 
for drugs;39 random sweeps for contraband; 39,41 and 
security cameras to monitor school39  (table 20.2). For 
example, 19 percent of high schools, 14 percent of middle 
schools, and 3 percent of primary schools reported that 
students were required to wear badges or picture IDs. 
However, a smaller percentage of high schools than middle 
or primary schools reported controlling access to buildings 
during school hours and requiring students to wear 
uniforms. A greater percentage of middle schools reported 
having an electronic notification system for a school-wide 
emergency (49 percent) than primary schools (43 percent) or 
high schools (44 percent).

In general, a higher percentage of schools with 1,000 or 
more students than schools with fewer students reported the 
use of each safety and security measure (the exceptions 
were controlling access to the building during school 
hours, drug testing for students in extracurricular 
activities, and requiring students to wear uniforms). For 
example, 56 percent of schools with 1,000 or more students 
had an electronic notification system for a school wide 
emergency, compared to 49 percent of schools with 500–999 
students, 41 percent of schools with 300–499 students, and 
31 percent of schools with less than 300 students.

The percentage of schools using various security measures 
has changed over time. Between the 1999–2000 and 2007–08 
school years, there was an increase in the percentage of 
public schools reporting the use of the following safety 
and security measures: controlled access to the building 
during school hours (from 75 to 90 percent); controlled 
access to school grounds during school hours (from 34 to 43 
percent); students required to wear badges or picture IDs 
(from 4 to 8 percent); faculty required to wear badges or 
picture IDs (from 25 to 58 percent); the use of one or more 
security cameras to monitor school (from 19 to 55 percent); 
the provision of telephones in most classrooms (from 45 to 
72 percent); and the requirement that students wear 
uniforms (from 12 to 18 percent) (figure 20.2 and table 
20.1). Between the 2003–04 and 2007–08 school years, there 
was an increase in the percentage of schools reporting the 
drug testing of student athletes (from 4 to 6 percent) as 
well as an increase in the percentage of schools reporting 
the drug testing of students in other extracurricular 
activities (from 3 to 4 percent).

39 Students in extracurricular activities other than 
athletics.
40 One or more check, sweep, or camera.
41 For example, drugs or weapons. Does not include dog 
sniffs.


Indicator 21
Students’ Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed 
at School
Sixty-six percent of students reported observing the use of 
one or more security cameras at their school in 2007 
compared to 58 percent of students in 2005.

Schools use a variety of measures to promote the safety of 
students, ranging from codes of student conduct to metal 
detectors. In the School Crime Supplement42 to the National 
Crime Victimization
Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked whether their school 
used certain security measures.43 Security measures include 
metal detectors, locker checks, security cameras, security 
guards or police officers, adult supervision in hallways, 
badges or picture identification for students, a code of 
student conduct, locked entrance or exit doors during the 
day, and a requirement that visitors sign in. In 2007, 
nearly all students ages 12–18 observed the use of at least 
one of the selected security measures at their school 
(figure 21.1 and table 21.1).

In 2007, the majority of students ages 12–18 reported that 
their school had a code of student conduct (96 percent) and 
a requirement that visitors sign in (94 percent). Ninety 
percent of students reported the presence of school staff 
or other adult supervision in the hallway, and 69 percent 
reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned 
police officers. Fifty-four percent of students reported 
locker checks, 61 percent reported locked entrance or exit 
doors during the day, and 66 percent reported the use of 
security cameras at their schools. Twenty-four percent of 
students reported that badges or picture identification 
were required. Metal detectors were the least observed of 
the selected safety and security measures: 10 percent of 
students reported the use of metal detectors at their 
school.

The percentage of students reporting the presence of some 
of the selected security measures increased between the two 
most recent survey years as well as over longer time 
periods. For example, a greater percentage of students 
reported observing the use of one or more security cameras 
at their school in 2007 (66 percent) than in 2005 (58 
percent). Over the longer time period of 2001 through 2007, 
the percentage of students who reported observing the use 
of one or more security cameras at their school increased 
from 39 to 66 percent. Similarly, a greater percentage of 
students reported locked entrance or exit doors during the 
day in 2007 (61 percent) than in 2005 (54 percent). Over 
the longer time period of
1999 through 2007, the percentage of students who reported 
locked entrance or exit doors during the day increased from 
38 to 61 percent.

In 2007, about 94 percent of students reported that their 
school had a requirement that visitors sign in compared to 
93 percent of students in 2005. Between 1999 and 2007, the 
percentage of students who reported a visitor sign-in 
requirement increased from 87 to 94 percent. No significant 
differences were detected in the percentage of students who 
reported metal detectors, locker checks, the presence of 
security guards and/or assigned police officers, 
requirements that students wear badges or picture 
identification, or a code of student conduct in their 
schools across all survey years.

42 In 2005 and 2007, the unit response rate for this survey 
did not meet NCES statistical standards; therefore, 
interpret the data with caution. For more information, 
please see appendix A.
43 Readers should note that this indicator relies on 
student reports of security measures and provides estimates 
based on students’ awareness of the measure rather than on 
documented practice. See Indicator 20 for a summary of the 
use of various security measures as reported by schools.

Appendix A: Technical Notes
General Information

The indicators in this report are based on information 
drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including 
national surveys of students, teachers, and principals, and 
data collections from federal departments and agencies, 
including the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National 
Center for Education Statistics, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample 
design, data collection method, and questionnaire design or 
is the result of a universe data collection. Universe data 
collections include a census of all known entities in a 
specific universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on school 
property). Readers should be cautious when comparing data 
from different sources. Differences in sampling procedures, 
populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all 
affect the comparability of results. For example, some 
questions from different surveys may appear the same, but 
were asked of different populations of students (e.g., 
students ages 12–18 or students in grades 9–12); in 
different years; about experiences that occurred within 
different periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or 
during the past 12 months); or at different locations 
(e.g., in school or anywhere).

All comparisons described in this report are statistically 
significant at the .05 level. The primary test procedure 
used in this report was Student’s t statistic, which tests 
the difference between two sample estimates. The t test 
formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. 
Estimates displayed in the text, figures, and tables are 
rounded from original estimates, not from a series of 
rounding.

The following is a description of data sources, accuracy of 
estimates, and statistical procedures used in this report.

Sources of Data

This section briefly describes each of the datasets used in 
this report: the School-Associated Violent Deaths 
Surveillance Study, the Supplementary Homicide Reports, the 
Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System 
Fatal, the National Crime Victimization Survey, the School 
Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization 
Survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the Schools and 
Staffing Survey, and the School Survey on Crime and Safety. 
Directions for obtaining more information are provided at 
the end of each description.

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study
(SAVD)

The School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study 
(SAVD) is an epidemiological study developed by the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction with the 
U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of 
Justice. SAVD seeks to describe the epidemiology of school-
associated violent deaths, identify common features of 
these deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated 
violent death in the United States, and identify potential 
risk factors for these deaths. The surveillance system 
includes descriptive data on all school-associated violent 
deaths in the United States, including all homicides, 
suicides , or legal intervention in which the fatal injury 
occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or 
secondary school; while the victim was on the way to or 
from regular sessions at such a school; or while attending 
or on the way to or from an official schools-sponsored 
event. Victims of such events include nonstudents, as well 
as students and staff members. SAVD includes descriptive 
information about the school, event, victim(s), and 
offender(s). The SAVD Surveillance System has collected 
data from July 1, 1992, through the present.

SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data 
on school-associated violent deaths. Cases are initially 
identified through a search of the LexisNexis newspaper and 
media database. Then law enforcement officials are 
contacted to confirm the details of the case and to 
determine if the event meets the case definition. Once a 
case is confirmed, a law enforcement official and a school 
official are interviewed regarding details about the 
school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the 
full law enforcement report is also sought for each case. 
The information obtained on schools includes school 
demographics, attendance/absentee rates, 
suspensions/expulsions and mobility, school history of 
weapon-carrying incidents, security measures, violence 
prevention activities, school response to the event, and 
school policies about weapon carrying. Event information 
includes the location of injury, the context of injury 
(while classes were being held, during break, etc.), 
motives for injury, method of injury, and school and 
community events happening around the time period. 
Information obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) includes 
demographics, circumstances of the event (date/time, 
alcohol or drug use, number of persons involved), types and 
origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological risk 
factors, school-related problems, extracurricular 
activities, and family history, including structure and 
stressors.

One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths were 
identified from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 1994 (Kachur et 
al. 1996). A more recent report from this data collection 
identified 253 school-associated violent deaths between 
July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999 (Anderson et al. 2001). 
Other publications from this study have described how the 
number of events change during the school year (Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the 
firearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and 
suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman et al. 
2004). The most recent publication describes trends in 
school associated homicide from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 
2006 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2008). The 
interviews conducted on cases between July 1, 1994, and 
June 30, 1999, achieved a response rate of 97 percent for 
police officials and 78 percent for school officials. For 
several reasons, all data for years from 1999 to the 
present are flagged as “subject to change”. For some recent 
data, the interviews with school and law enforcement 
officials to verify case details have not been completed. 
The details learned during the interviews can occasionally 
change the classification of a case. Also, new cases may be 
identified because of the expansion of the scope of the 
media files used for case identification. Sometimes other 
cases not identified during earlier data years using the 
independent case finding efforts (which focus on nonmedia 
sources of information) will be discovered. Also, other 
cases may occasionally be identified while the law 
enforcement and school interviews are being conducted to 
verify known cases.

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR)

The Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), which are a part 
of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, provide 
incident-level information on criminal homicides, including 
situation (number of victims to number of offenders); the 
age, sex, and race of victims and offenders; types of 
weapons used; circumstances of the incident; and the 
relationship of the victim to the offender. The data are 
provided monthly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
(FBI) by local law enforcement agencies participating in 
the FBI’s UCR program. The data include murders and 
nonnegligent manslaughters in the United States from 
January 1976 to December 2008; that is, negligent 
manslaughters and justifiable homicides have been 
eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement agency 
reports, the FBI estimates that 644,554 murders (including 
nonnegligent manslaughters) were committed from 1976 to 
2008. Agencies provided detailed information on 582,405 
victims and 648,526 offenders.

About 90 percent of homicides are included in the SHR. 
However, adjustments can be made to the weights to correct 
for missing reports. Estimates from the SHR used in this 
report were generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
(BJS) using a weight developed by BJS that reconciles the 
counts of SHR homicide victims with those in the UCR for 
the 1992 through 2005 data years. The weight is the same 
for all cases for a given year. The weight represents the 
ratio of the number of homicides reported in the UCR to the 
number reported in the SHR. For additional information

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System 
Fatal (WISQARS™ Fatal)

WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to injury. 
The mortality data reported in WISQARS Fatal come from 
death certificate data reported to the National Center for 
Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. Data include causes of death reported by 
attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. It 
also includes demographic information about decedents 
reported by funeral directors, who obtain that information 
from family members and other informants.
NCHS collects, compiles, verifies, and prepares these data 
for release to the public. The data provide information 
about what types of injuries are leading causes of deaths, 
how common they are, and who they affect. These data are 
intended for a broad audience—the public, the media, public 
health practitioners and researchers, and public health 
officials—to increase their knowledge of injury.

WISQARS Fatal mortality reports provide tables of the total 
numbers of injury-related deaths and the death rates per 
100,000 U.S. population. The reports list deaths according 
to cause (mechanism) and intent (manner) of injury by 
state, race, Hispanic origin, sex, and age groupings. For

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), 
administered for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics by 
the U.S. Census Bureau, is the nation’s primary source of 
information on crime and the victims of crime. Initiated in 
1972 and redesigned in 1992, the NCVS collects detailed 
information annually on the frequency and nature of the 
crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and 
simple assault, theft, household burglary, and motor 
vehicle theft experienced by Americans and their households 
each year. The survey measures both crimes reported to 
police and crimes not reported to the police.

Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with 
changes to the Office of Management and Budget’s standards 
for the classification of federal data on race and 
ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity was modified. A 
question on Hispanic origin is followed by a question on 
race. The new question about race allows the respondent to 
choose more than one race and delineates Asian as a 
separate category from Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific 
Islander. Analysis conducted by the Demographic Surveys 
Division at the U.S. Census Bureau showed that the new 
question had very little impact on the aggregate racial 
distribution of the NCVS respondents, with one exception. 
There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the percentage 
of respondents who reported themselves as White. Due to 
changes in race/ethnicity categories, comparisons of 
race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution.

There were changes in the sample design and survey 
methodology in the 2006 National Crime Victimization Survey 
(NCVS) that impacted survey estimates. Due to this 
redesign, 2006 data are not presented in this indicator. 
Data from 2007 onward are comparable to earlier years. 
Analysis of the 2007 estimates indicate that the program 
changes made in 2007 had relatively small effects on NCVS 
changes. As discussed in Criminal Victimization, 2006 the 
substantial increases in victimization rates from 2005 to 
2006 do not appear to be due to actual changes in crime 
during that period. The increases were attributed to the 
impact of methodological changes in the survey. For more 
information on the 2006 NCVS data, see Criminal 
Victimization, 2006 at 
http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv06.pdf and the 
technical notes at 
http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv06tn.pdf. The 
number of NCVS eligible households in sample in 2008 was 
about 42,000. They were selected using a stratified, 
multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary 
sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of 
counties, were selected. In the second stage, smaller 
areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected 
from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters 
of four households, called segments, were selected for 
interview. At each stage, the selection was done 
proportionate to population size in order to create a self-
weighting sample. The final sample was augmented to account 
for households constructed after the decennial Census. 
Within each sampled household, U.S. Census Bureau personnel 
interviewed all household members age 12 and older to 
determine whether they had been victimized by the measured 
crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview.

The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted 
in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by 
telephone, if possible. About 67,000 persons age 12 and 
older are interviewed each 6 months. Households remain in 
the sample for 3 years and are interviewed seven times at 
6-month intervals. Since the survey’s inception, the 
initial interview at each sample unit has been used only to 
bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid 
duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent 
interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from the initial 
interview have been adjusted to account for the effects of 
bounding and included in the survey estimates. After their 
seventh interview, households are replaced by new sample 
households. The NCVS has consistently obtained a response 
rate of over 90 percent at the household level. The 
completion rates for persons within households in 2008 were 
about 86 percent. Weights were developed to permit 
estimates for the total U.S. population 12 years and older.

School Crime Supplement (SCS)

Created as a supplement to the NCVS and code signed by the 
National Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of 
Justice Statistics, the School Crime Supplement (SCS) 
survey was conducted in 1989, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 
and 2007 to collect additional information about school-
related victimizations on a national level. This report 
includes data from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 
2007 collections. The 1989 data are not included in this 
report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS 
and SCS. The survey was designed to assist policymakers as 
well as academic researchers and practitioners at the 
federal, state, and local levels so that they can make 
informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The SCS 
asks students a number of key questions about their 
experiences with and perceptions of crime and violence that 
occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on a 
school bus, or on the way to or from school. Additional 
questions not included in the NCVS were also added to the 
SCS, such as those concerning preventive measures used by 
the school, students’ participation in after school 
activities, students’ perceptions of school rules, the 
presence of weapons and gangs in school, the presence of 
hate-related words and graffiti in school, student reports 
of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the 
availability of drugs and alcohol in school, as well as 
attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and 
avoidance behavior at school.

In all SCS survey years through 2005, the SCS was conducted 
for a 6-month period from January to June in all households 
selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information 
about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the 
race/ethnicity item made for 2003 onward). It should be 
noted that the initial NCVS interview has always been 
included in the SCS data collection. Within these 
households, the eligible respondents for the SCS were those 
household members who had attended school at any time 
during the 6 months preceding the interview, were enrolled 
in grades 6–12, and were not home schooled. In 2007, the 
questionnaire was changed and household members who 
attended school any time during the school year were 
included. The age range of students covered in this report 
is 12–18 years of age. Eligible respondents were asked the 
supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing 
their entire NCVS interview.

The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 
2005, and 2007 was calculated by using NCVS incident 
variables appended to the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 
2007 SCS data ?les. The NCVS type of crime variable was 
used to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as 
serious violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables 
asking where the incident happened and what the victim was 
doing when it happened were used to ascertain whether the 
incident happened at school. For prevalence of 
victimization, the NCVS definition of “at school” includes 
in the school building, on school property, or on the way 
to or from school. Only incidents that occurred inside the 
United States are included.

In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified from 
previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, “at school” 
was defined for respondents as in the school building, on 
the school grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the 
definition for “at school” was changed to mean in the 
school building, on school property, on a school bus, or 
going to and from school. This change was made to the 2001 
questionnaire in order to be consistent with the definition 
of “at school” as it is constructed in the NCVS and was 
also used as the definition in 2003, 2005, and 2007. 
Cognitive interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on 
the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the definition 
of “at school” would not have a substantial impact on the 
estimates.

A total of 9,700 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 
8,400 in 1999, 8,400 in 2001, 7,200 in 2003, 6,300 in 2005, 
and 5,600 in 2007. In the 2007 SCS, the household 
completion rate was 90 percent. In the 1995, 1999, 2001, 
2003, and 2005 SCS, the household completion rates were 95 
percent, 94 percent, 93 percent, 92 percent, and 91 
percent, respectively, and the student completion rates 
were 78 percent, 78 percent, 77 percent, 70 percent, and 62 
percent respectively. For the 2007 SCS, the student 
completion rate was 58 percent.

Thus, the overall unweighted SCS response rate (calculated 
by multiplying the household completion rate by the student 
completion rate) was 74 percent in 1995, 73 percent in 
1999, 72 percent in 2001, 64 percent in 2003, 56 percent in 
2005, and 53 percent in 2007. Response rates for most 
survey items were high—typically over 95 percent of all 
eligible respondents. The weights were developed to 
compensate for differential probabilities of selection and 
nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the 
eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in 
1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007.

Due to the low unit response rate in 2005 and 2007, a unit 
nonresponse bias analysis was done. There are two types of 
nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse. Unit response rates 
indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. 
Because interviews with students could only be completed 
after households had responded to the NCVS, the unit 
completion rate for the SCS reflects both the household 
interview completion rate and the student interview 
completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the 
strength and application of survey data by leading to an 
increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the 
actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the 
nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are 
different from the respondents. Furthermore, imputation, a 
common recourse to nonresponse, can lead to the risk of 
underestimating the sampling error if imputed data are 
treated as though they were observed data.

In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have 
different response rates and responses to particular survey 
variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is 
determined by the response rate and the differences between 
respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables. 
Although the bias analysis cannot measure response bias 
since the SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how 
the population would have responded, the SCS sampling frame 
has four key student or school characteristic variables for 
which data is known for respondents and nonrespondents: 
sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity, all 
of which are associated with student victimization. To the 
extent that there are differential responses by respondents 
in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern.

In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found 
evidence of bias for the race, household income, and 
urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other (non-
Hispanic) respondents had higher response rates than Black 
(non-Hispanic) and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from 
households with an income of $35,000–$49,999 and $50,000 or 
more had higher response rates than those from households 
with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500–$14,999, $15,000–
$24,999 and $25,000–$34,999. Respondents who live in urban 
areas had lower response rates than those who live in rural 
or suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse bias 
cannot be determined, weighting adjustments, which 
corrected for differential response rates, should have 
reduced the problem.

In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found 
evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household income 
variables. Hispanic respondents had lower response rates 
than other race/ethnicities.
Respondents from households with an income of $25,000 or 
more had higher response rates than those from households 
with incomes of less than $25,000. However, when responding 
students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there 
were no measurable differences between the responding 
students and the eligible students, suggesting the 
nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall 
estimates.

Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS)

The National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) 
is one component of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance 
System (YRBSS), an epidemiological surveillance system 
developed by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor 
the prevalence of youth behaviors that most influence 
health. The YRBS focuses on priority health-risk behaviors 
established during youth that result in the most 
significant mortality, morbidity, disability, and social 
problems during both youth and adulthood. This report uses 
1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 
YRBS data.

The YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to 
produce a nationally representative sample of students in 
grades 9–12 in the United States. The target population 
consisted of all public and private school students in 
grades 9–12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
The first-stage sampling frame included selecting primary 
sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of 
urbanization and the relative percentage of Black and 
Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either 
counties; subareas of large counties; or groups of smaller, 
adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools were 
selected with probability proportional to school enrollment 
size.

The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly 
selecting, in each chosen school and in each of grades 9–
12, one or two classrooms from either a required subject, 
such as English or social studies, or a required period, 
such as homeroom or second period. All students in selected 
classes were eligible to participate. Three strategies were 
used to oversample Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger 
sampling rates were used to select PSUs that are in high-
Black and high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of 
size was used that increased the probability of selecting 
schools with a disproportionately high percentage of 
combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or 
American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment; and (3) two 
classes per grade, rather than one, were selected in 
schools with a high percentage of combined Black, Hispanic, 
Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native 
enrollment. Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, 
13,600, 15,200, 13,900, 14,000, and 16,400 students 
participated in the 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 
2005, 2007, and 2009 surveys, respectively.

The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 
survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 
1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for 
the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, 67 percent 
for the 2005 survey, 68 percent for the 2007 survey, and 71 
percent for the 2009 survey. NCES standards call for 
response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional 
surveys, and bias analyses are required by NCES when that 
percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full 
nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the 
data necessary to do the analysis are not available. The 
weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the 
oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample. 
The final weights were constructed so that only weighted 
proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) 
in each grade matched national population projections.

State-level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: 
Comprehensive Results web page. Each state and local 
school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster sample 
design to produce representative samples of students in 
grades 9–12 in their jurisdiction. All except a few state 
and local samples include only public schools, and each 
local sample includes only schools in the funded school 
district (e.g., San Diego Unified School District) rather 
than in the entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area).

In the first sampling stage in all except a few states and 
districts, schools are selected with probability 
proportional to school enrollment size. In the second 
sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or 
intact classes during a required period (e.g., second 
period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled 
classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and 
districts modify these procedures to meet their individual 
needs. For example, in a given state or district, all 
schools, rather than a sample of schools, might be selected 
to participate. State and local surveys that have a 
scientifically selected sample, appropriate documentation, 
and an overall response rate greater than or equal to 60 
percent are weighted. The overall response rate reflects 
the school response rate multiplied by the student response 
rate. These three criteria are used to ensure that the data 
from those surveys can be considered representative of 
students in grades 9–12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is 
applied to each record to adjust for student nonresponse 
and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and 
race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted 
estimates are representative of all students in grades 9–12 
attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not 
have an overall response rate of greater than or equal to 
60 percent and that do not have appropriate documentation 
are not weighted and are not included in this report.

In 2009, a total of 42 states and 20 districts had weighted 
data. In sites with weighted data, the student sample sizes 
for the state and local YRBS ranged from 965 to 14,870. 
School response rates ranged from 73 to 100 percent, 
student response rates ranged from 61 to 90 percent, and 
overall response rates ranged from 60 to 94 percent.

Readers should note that reports of these data published by 
the CDC and in this report do not include percentages where 
the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases.

In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of 
Management and Budget’s standards for the classification of 
federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on 
race/ethnicity was modified. The version of the race and 
ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 was:

How do you describe yourself?
a. White—not Hispanic
b. Black—not Hispanic
c. Hispanic or Latino
d. Asian or Pacific Islander
e. American Indian or Alaskan Native
f. Other

The version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 and in 
the 2009 state and local surveys was:

How do you describe yourself? (Select one or more 
responses.)
a. American Indian or Alaska Native
b. Asian
c. Black or African American
d. Hispanic or Latino
e. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander
f. White

In the 2005 national survey and in all 2007 and 2009 
surveys, race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: 
(1) “Are you Hispanic or Latino?” (response options were 
“yes” and “no”), and (2) “What is your race?” (response 
options were “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian,” 
“Black or African American,” “Native Hawaiian or Other 
Pacific Islander,” or “White”). For the second question, 
students could select more than one response option. For 
this report, students were classified as “Hispanic” if they 
answered “yes” to the first question, regardless of how 
they answered the second question. Students who answered 
“no” to the first question and selected more than one 
race/ethnicity in the second category were classified as 
“More than one race.” Students who answered “no” to the 
first question and selected only one race/ethnicity were 
classified as that race/ ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was 
classified as missing for students who did not answer the 
first question and for students who answered “no” to the 
first question but did not answer the second question.

CDC has conducted two studies to understand the effect of 
changing the race/ethnicity item on the YRBS. Brener, Kann, 
and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select 
more than one response to a single race/ethnicity question 
on the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ 
ethnicity among high school students. Eaton, Brener, Kann, 
and Pittman (2007) found that self-reported race/ethnicity 
was similar regardless of whether the single-question or a 
two-question format was used.

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS)

This report draws upon data on teacher victimization from 
the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), which provides 
national- and state-level data on public schools and 
national- and affiliation-level data on private schools. 
The 1993–94, 1999–2000, 2003–04, and 2007–08 SASS were 
collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and sponsored by the 
National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The
1993–94, 1999–2000, and 2003–04 administrations of SASS 
consisted of four sets of linked surveys, including surveys 
of schools, the principals of each selected school, a 
subsample of teachers within each school, and public school 
districts. The 2007–08 administration of SASS consisted of 
five types of questionnaires: district questionnaires, 
principal questionnaires, school questionnaires, teacher 
questionnaires, and school library media center 
questionnaires. In 1993–94, there were two sets of teacher 
surveys, public and private school teachers. In 1999–2000, 
there were four sets of teacher surveys, public, private, 
public charter, and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) school 
teachers. In 2003–04 and 2007–08, there were three sets of 
teacher surveys, public (including public charter), 
private, and BIE. For this report, BIE and public charter 
schools are included with public schools.

The public school sampling frames for the 1993–94, 1999–
2000, 2003–04, and 2007–08 SASS were created using the 
1991–92, 1997–98, 2001–02, and 2005–06 NCES Common Core of 
Data (CCD)Public School Universe Files, respectively. In 
SASS, a school was defined as an institution or part of an 
institution that provides classroom instruction to 
students; has one or more teachers to provide instruction; 
serves students in one or more of grades 1–12 or the 
ungraded equivalent and is located in one or more buildings 
apart from a private home. It was possible for two or more 
schools to share the same building; in this case they were 
treated as different schools if they had different 
administrations (i.e., principals or school head). Since 
CCD and SASS differ in scope and their definition of a 
school, some records were deleted, added, or modified in 
order to provide better coverage and a more efficient 
sample design for SASS. Data were collected by multistage 
sampling, which began with the selection of schools.

This report uses 1993–94, 1999–2000, 2003–04, and 2007–08 
SASS data. Approximately 10,000 public schools and 3,300 
private schools were selected to participate in the 1993–94 
SASS, 11,100 public schools (9,900 public schools, 100 BIE-
funded schools, and 1,100 charter schools) and 3,600 
private schools were selected to participate in the 1999–
2000 SASS, 10,400 public schools (10,200 public schools and 
200 BIE-funded schools) and 3,600 private schools were 
selected to participate in the 2003– 04 SASS, and 9,980 
public schools (9,800 public schools and 180 BIE-funded 
schools) and 2,940 private schools were selected to 
participate in the 2007–08 SASS. Within each school, 
teachers selected were further stratified into one of five 
teacher types in the following hierarchy: (1) Asian or 
Pacific Islander; (2) American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; 
(3) teachers who teach classes designed for students with 
limited English proficiency; (4) teachers in their first, 
second, or third year of teaching; and (5) teachers not 
classified in any of the other groups. Within each teacher 
stratum, teachers were selected systematically with equal 
probability. In 1993–94, approximately 57,000 public school 
teachers and 11,500 private school teachers were sampled. 
In 1999– 2000, 56,300 public school teachers, 500 BIE 
teachers, 4,400 public charter school teachers, and 10,800 
private school teachers were sampled. In 2003–04, 52,500 
public school teachers, 700 BIE teachers, and 10,000 
private school teachers were sampled. In 2007–08, 47,440 
public school teachers, 750 BIE teachers, and 8,180 private 
school teachers were sampled.

This report focuses on responses from teachers. The overall 
weighted response rate for public school teachers in 1993–
94 was 88 percent. In 1999–2000, the overall weighted 
response rates were 77 percent for public school teachers, 
and 86 and 72 percent for BIE and public charter school 
teachers, respectively (which are included with public 
school teachers for this report). In 2003–04, the overall 
weighted response rates were 76 percent for public school 
teachers and 86 percent for BIE-funded school teachers (who 
are included with public school teachers). In 2007–08, the 
overall weighted response rates were 72 percent for public 
school teachers and 71 percent for BIE-funded school 
teachers (who are included with public school teachers). 
For private school teachers, the overall weighted response 
rates were 80 percent in 1993–94, 67 percent in 1999–2000, 
70 percent in 2003–04, and 66 percent in 2007–08. Values 
were imputed for questionnaire items that should have been 
answered but were not. For additional information about

School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS)

The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) is managed by 
the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) on 
behalf of the U.S. Department of Education. SSOCS collects 
extensive crime and safety data from principals and school 
administrators of U.S. public schools. Data from this 
collection can be used to examine the relationship between 
school characteristics and violent and serious violent 
crimes in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, 
and combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can be 
used to assess what crime prevention programs, practices, 
and policies are used by schools. SSOCS has been conducted 
in school years 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2005–06, and 2007–08. A 
fifth collection is planned for school year 2009–10.

SSOCS was developed by NCES and is funded by the Office of 
Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S. Department of 
Education. The 2007–08 SSOCS (SSOCS:2008) was conducted by 
the U.S. Census Bureau. Data collection began on February 
25, 2008, when questionnaire packets were mailed to sampled 
schools, and continued through June 18, 2008. A total of 
2,560 public schools submitted usable questionnaires: 618 
primary schools, 897 middle schools, 936 high schools, and 
109 combined schools.

The sampling frame for SSOCS:2008 was constructed from the 
public school universe file created for the 2007–08 Schools 
and Staffing Survey (SASS). The SASS frame was derived from 
the 2005–06 Common
Core of Data (CCD) Public Elementary/Secondary School 
Universe data file. Certain types of schools were excluded 
from the CCD file in order to meet the sampling needs of 
SASS: those in U.S. outlying areas1 and Puerto Rico, 
overseas Department of Defense schools, newly closed 
schools, home schools, and schools with a high grade of 
kindergarten or lower. Additional schools were then 
excluded from the SASS frame to meet the sampling needs of 
SSOCS: special education schools, vocational schools, 
alternative schools (e.g., adult continuing education 
schools and remedial schools), ungraded schools, schools 
sponsored by the Bureau of Indian Education, and other 
“nonregular” schools.2 Charter schools were not excluded. 
The use of the modified SASS sampling frame for SSOCS:2008 
is consistent with the 1999–2000 SSOCS (SSOCS:2000) and the 
2003–04 SSOCS (SSOCS:2004). The 2005–06 SSOCS (SSOCS:2006) 
deviated from this by using the CCD directly as a sampling 
frame. This deviation was necessary because SSOCS:2006 
occurred between SASS collections.

A total of 3,484 schools were selected for the 2008 study. 
In February 2008, questionnaires were mailed to school 
principals, who were asked to complete the survey or to 
have it completed by the person most knowledgeable about 
discipline issues at the school. A total of 2,560 schools 
completed the survey. The weighted overall response rate 
was 77.2 percent. A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted 
on the 13 items with weighted item nonresponse rates below 
85 percent. The detected bias was not deemed problematic 
enough to suppress any items from the data file. Weights 
were developed to adjust for the variable probabilities of 
selection and differential nonresponse and can be used to 
produce national estimates for regular public schools in 
the 2007–08 school year. For information on the 1999–2000, 
2003–04, 2005–06, and 2007–08 iterations, see Neiman and 
DeVoe (2009). For more information about the School Survey

Accuracy of Estimates

The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint 
effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both types of 
error affect the estimates presented in this report. 
Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For 
example, members of the population of interest are 
inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled 
members refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item 
nonresponse) or all of the survey questions (questionnaire 
nonresponse); mistakes are made during data editing, 
coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide 
differ from the “true” responses; or measurement 
instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure 
the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although 
nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item 
nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of 
sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting 
nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors 
is usually difficult.

Sampling errors occur because observations are made on 
samples rather than on entire populations.
Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling 
errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat 
from those that would have been obtained by a complete 
census of the relevant population using the same survey 
instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard 
error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to 
sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic 
obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard 
errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate 
the precision of the difference between the two statistics 
and to help determine whether the difference based on the 
sample is large enough so that it represents the population 
difference.

Most of the data used in this report were obtained from 
complex sampling designs rather than a simple random 
design. The features of complex sampling require different 
techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for 
data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore, 
calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are 
markedly different from the ones used when the data are 
from a simple random sample. The Taylor series 
approximation technique or the balanced repeated 
replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the 
statistics and their standard errors in this report.

Standard error calculation for data from the School Crime 
Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation 
method using PSU and strata variables available from each 
dataset. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data, 
standard errors were derived from a formula developed by 
the U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized 
variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent 
the curve fitted to the individual standard errors 
calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication 
technique.

The coefficient of variation (CV) represents the ratio of 
the standard error to the mean. As an attribute of a 
distribution, the CV is an important measure of the 
reliability and accuracy of an estimate. In this report, 
the CV was calculated for all estimates, and in cases where 
the CV was at least 30 percent the estimates were noted 
with a ! symbol (interpret data with caution). In cases 
where the CV was greater than 50 percent, the estimate was 
determined not to meet reporting standards and was 
suppressed.

Statistical Procedures

The comparisons in the text have been tested for 
statistical significance to ensure that the differences are 
larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. 
Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report 
are statistically significant at the .05 level. Several 
test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data 
being analyzed and the nature of the statement being 
tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was 
Student’s t statistic, which tests the difference between 
two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted 
for multiple comparisons. The formula used to compute the t 
statistic is as follows:

(1)	INSERT EQUATION

where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared and se1 
and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that 
this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When 
the estimates are not independent (for example, when 
comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup 
included in the total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * 
se1 * se2) must be subtracted from the denominator of the 
formula:

(2)	INSERT EQUATION

where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value 
was computed, it was compared with the published tables of 
values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For 
this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which has a t 
value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than 1.96, then 
the difference between the two estimates is statistically 
significant at the 95 percent level.

A linear trend test was used when differences among 
percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of 
a variable, rather than the differences between two 
discrete categories. This test allows one to examine 
whether, for example, the percentage of students using 
drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the 
percentage of students who reported being physically 
attacked in school increased (or decreased) with their age. 
Based on a regression with, for example, student’s age as 
the independent variable and whether a student was 
physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test 
involves computing the regression coefficient (b) and its 
corresponding standard error (se). The ratio of these two 
(b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, 
the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha 
level, the hypothesis that there is a linear relationship 
between student’s age and being physically attacked is not 
rejected.

Some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable 
with three or more levels involved a test for a linear 
trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests 
between pairs of categories. In this report, when 
differences among percentages were examined relative to a 
variable with ordered categories, analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between 
the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included 
orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive 
levels of the independent variable. The squares of the 
Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that 
were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance 
between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were 
used to partition the total sum of squares into within- and 
between-group sums of squares. These were used to create 
mean squares for the within- and between-group variance 
components and their corresponding F statistics, which were 
then compared with published values of F for a significance 
level of .05. Significant values of both the overall F and 
the F associated with the linear contrast term were 
required as evidence of a linear relationship between the 
two variables.

1 “U.S. outlying areas” include the following: America 
Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, 
and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
2 “Nonregular” schools includes cases of schools-within-
schools, which were found in Minnesota and Georgia.

Appendix B: Glossary of Terms
General Terms
Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any act 
that the government has determined is injurious to the 
public, including felonies and misdemeanors. Such violation 
may or may not involve violence, and it may affect 
individuals or property.

Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving one 
or more victims and one or more offenders.

Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in which 
there is more than one wave of sampling. That is, one 
sample of units is drawn, and then another sample is drawn 
within that sample. For example, at the first stage, a 
number of Census blocks may be sampled out of all the 
Census blocks in the United States. At the second stage, 
households are sampled within the previously sampled Census 
blocks.

Prevalence The percentage of the population directly 
affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based 
upon specific information elicited directly from the 
respondent regarding crimes committed against his or her 
person, against his or her property, or against an 
individual bearing a unique relationship to him or her. It 
is not based upon perceptions and beliefs about, or 
reactions to, criminal acts.

School An education institution consisting of one or more 
of grades K through 12.

School crime Any criminal activity that is committed on 
school property.

School year The 12-month period of time denoting the 
beginning and ending dates for school accounting purposes, 
usually from July 1 through June 30.

Stratification A survey sampling technique in which the 
target population is divided into mutually exclusive groups 
or strata based on some variable or variables (e.g., 
metropolitan area) and sampling of units occurs separately 
within each stratum.

Unequal probabilities A survey sampling technique in which 
sampled units do not have the same probability of selection 
into the sample. For example, the investigator may 
oversample rural students in order to increase the sample 
sizes of rural students. Rural students would then be more 
likely than other students to be sampled.

Specific Terms Used in Various Surveys

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study

Homicide An act involving a killing of one person by 
another resulting from interpersonal violence.

School-associated violent death A homicide or suicide in 
which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a 
functioning elementary or secondary school in the United 
States, while the victim was on the way to or from regular 
sessions at such a school, or while the victim was 
attending or traveling to or from an official school-
sponsored event. Victims included nonstudents as well as 
students and staff members.

Suicide An act of taking one’s own life voluntarily and 
intentionally.

National Crime Victimization Survey

Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with a 
weapon, regardless of whether or not an injury occurs, and 
attack without a weapon when serious injury results.

At school (students) Inside the school building, on school 
property (school parking area, play area, school bus, 
etc.), or on the way to or from school.

Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) Geographic entities 
defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 
for use by federal statistical agencies in collecting, 
tabulating, and publishing federal statistics.

Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both psychological 
coercion as well as physical force.

Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or oral 
penetration by the offender(s). Includes attempts and 
verbal threats of rape. This category also includes 
incidents where the penetration is from a foreign object, 
such as a bottle.

Robbery Completed or attempted theft, directly from a 
person, of property or cash by force or threat of force, 
with or without a weapon, and with or without injury.

Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or 
aggravated assault.

Sexual assault A wide range of victimizations, separate 
from rape or attempted rape. These crimes include attacks 
or attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual 
contact between the victim and offender. Sexual assault may 
or may not involve force and includes such things as 
grabbing or fondling. Sexual assault also includes verbal 
threats.

Simple assault Attack without a weapon resulting either in 
no injury, minor injury, or an undetermined injury 
requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization. Also 
includes attempted assault without a weapon.

Theft Completed or attempted theft of property or cash 
without personal contact.

Victimization A crime as it affects one individual person 
or household. For personal crimes, the number of 
victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. 
The number of victimizations may be greater than the number 
of incidents because more than one person may be victimized 
during an incident.

Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of 
victimizations among a specific population group.

Violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated 
assault, or simple assault.

School Crime Supplement

At school In the school building, on school property, on a 
school bus, or going to or from school.

Gang Street gangs, fighting gangs, crews, or something 
else. Gangs may use common names, signs, symbols, or 
colors. All gangs, whether or not they are involved in 
violent or illegal activity, are included.

Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or 
aggravated assault.

Total victimization Combination of violent victimization 
and theft. If a student reported an incident of either 
type, he or she is counted as having experienced any 
victimization. If the student reported having experienced 
both, he or she is counted once under “total 
victimization.”

Violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated 
assault, or simple assault.

Youth Risk Behavior Survey

Illegal drugs Examples of illegal drugs were marijuana, 
cocaine, inhalants, steroids, or prescription drugs without 
a doctor’s permission, heroin, and methamphetamines.

include guns, knives, and clubs.

Schools and Staffing Survey

City A territory inside an urbanized area (defined as 
densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000 or more 
of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled 
surrounding areas) and inside a principal city (defined as 
a city that contains the primary population and economic 
center of a metropolitan statistical area, which, in turn, 
is defined as one or more contiguous counties that have a 
“core” area with a large population nucleus and adjacent 
communities that are highly integrated economically or 
socially with the core).

Elementary school A school in which the lowest grade is 
less than or equal to grade 6 and the highest grade is less 
than or equal to grade 8.

Elementary school teachers An elementary school teacher is 
one who, when asked for the grades taught, checked: (1) 
only “ungraded” and was designated as an elementary teacher 
on the list of teachers provided by the school; (2) 6th 
grade or lower or “ungraded,” and no grade higher than 6th; 
(3) 6th grade or lower and 7th grade or higher, and 
reported a primary assignment of prekindergarten, 
kindergarten, or general elementary; (4) 7th and 8th grades 
only, and reported a primary assignment of prekindergarten, 
kindergarten, or general elementary; (5) 6th grade or lower 
and 7th grade or higher, and reported a primary assignment 
of special education and was designated as an elementary 
teacher on the list of teachers provided by the school; or 
(6) 7th and 8th grades only, and reported a primary 
assignment of special education and was designated as an 
elementary teacher on the list of teachers provided by the 
school. A teacher at a school that has grade 6 or lower or 
one that is “ungraded” with no grade higher than the 8th.

Instructional level Instructional levels divide teachers 
into elementary or secondary based on a combination of the 
grades taught, main teaching assignment, and the structure 
of the teacher’s class(es). Those with only ungraded 
classes are categorized as elementary level teachers if 
their main assignment is early childhood/prekindergarten or 
elementary, or they teach either special education in a 
self-contained classroom or an elementary enrichment class. 
All other teachers with ungraded classes are classified as 
secondary level. Among teachers with regularly graded 
classes, in general, elementary level teachers teach any of 
grades prekindergarten through 5th; report an early 
childhood/prekindergarten, elementary, self-contained 
special education, or elementary enrichment main 
assignment; or are those whose preponderance of grades 
taught are kindergarten through 6th. In general, secondary 
level teachers instruct any of grades 7 through 12 but 
usually no grade lower than 5th. They also teach more of 
grades 7 through 12 than lower level grades.

Rural A territory outside any urbanized area (defined as 
densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000 or more 
of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled 
surrounding areas) or urban cluster (defined as densely 
settled “cores” with populations between 25,000 and 50,000 
of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled 
surrounding areas).

Secondary school A school in which the lowest grade is 
greater than or equal to grade 7 and the highest grade is 
less than or equal to grade 12.

Secondary school teachers A secondary school teacher is one 
who, when asked for the grades taught, checked: (1) 
“ungraded” and was designated as a secondary teacher on the 
list of teachers provided by the school; (2) 6th grade or 
lower and 7th grade or higher, and reported a primary 
assignment other than prekindergarten, kindergarten, or 
general elementary; (3) 9th grade or higher, or 9th grade 
or higher and “ungraded”; (4) 7th and 8th grades only, and 
reported a primary assignment other than prekindergarten, 
kindergarten, general elementary, or special education; (5) 
7th and 8th grades only, and reported a primary assignment 
of special education and was designated as a secondary 
teacher on the list of teachers provided by the school; or 
(6) 6th grade or lower and 7th grade or higher, or 7th and 
8th grades only, and was not categorized above as either 
elementary or secondary.

Suburban A territory outside a principal city (defined as a 
city that contains the primary population and economic 
center of a metropolitan statistical area, which, in turn, 
is defined as one or more contiguous counties that have a 
“core” area with a large population nucleus and adjacent 
communities that are highly integrated economically or 
socially with the core) and inside an urbanized area 
(defined as densely settled “cores” with populations of 
50,000 or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent 
densely settled surrounding areas).

Town A territory inside an urban cluster (defined as 
densely settled “cores” with populations between
25,000 and 50,000 of Census-defined blocks with adjacent 
densely settled surrounding areas).

School Survey on Crime and Safety

At school/at your school Includes activities that happened 
in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, 
and at places that held school-sponsored events or 
activities. Unless otherwise specified, respondents were 
instructed to report on activities that occurred during 
normal school hours or when school activities/events were 
in session.

City As collected by the Common Core of Data and appended 
to the SSOCS data ?le, city includes territories inside an 
urbanized area and inside a principal city and includes 
large cities (populations of 250,000 or more), midsize 
cities (population less than 250,000 and greater than or 
equal to 100,000) and small cities (population less than 
100,000).

Combined schools Schools that include all combinations of 
grades, including K–12 schools, other than primary, middle, 
and high schools (see definitions for these school levels 
later in this section).

Cult or extremist group A group that espouses radical 
beliefs and practices, which may include a religious 
component, that are widely seen as threatening the basic 
values and cultural norms of society at large.

Firearm/explosive device Any weapon that is designed to (or 
may readily be converted to) expel a projectile by the 
action of an explosive. This includes guns, bombs, 
grenades, mines, rockets, missiles, pipe bombs, or similar 
devices designed to explode and capable of causing bodily 
harm or property damage.

Gang An ongoing loosely organized association of three or 
more persons, whether formal or informal, that has a common 
name, signs, symbols, or colors, whose members engage, 
either individually or collectively, in violent or other 
forms of illegal behavior.

High school A school in which the lowest grade is not lower 
than grade 9 and the highest grade is not higher than grade 
12.

Hate crime A criminal offense or threat against a person, 
property, or society that is motivated, in whole or in 
part, by the offender’s bias against a race, color, 
national origin, ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, 
or sexual orientation.

Insubordination A deliberate and inexcusable defiance of or 
refusal to obey a school rule, authority, or a reasonable 
order. It includes but is not limited to direct defiance of 
school authority, failure to attend assigned detention or 
on-campus supervision, failure to respond to a call slip, 
and physical or verbal intimidation/abuse.

Intimidation To frighten, compel, or deter by actual or 
implied threats. It includes bullying and sexual 
harassment. (Intimidation was not defined in the front of 
the questionnaire in 2005–06.)

Middle school A school in which the lowest grade is not 
lower than grade 4 and the highest grade is not higher than 
grade 9.

Physical attack or fight An actual and intentional touching 
or striking of another person against his or her will, or 
the intentional causing of bodily harm to an individual.

Primary school A school in which the lowest grade is not 
higher than grade 3 and the highest grade is not higher 
than grade 8.

Rape Forced sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal, or oral 
penetration). Includes penetration from a foreign object.

Robbery The taking or attempting to take anything of value 
that is owned by another person or organization, under 
confrontational circumstances by force or threat of force 
or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear. A key 
difference between robbery and theft/larceny is that a 
threat or battery is involved in robbery.

Rural As collected by the Common Core of Data and appended 
to the SSOCS data ?le, rural includes fringe rural areas
