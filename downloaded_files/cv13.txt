Bulletin	

Criminal Victimization, 2013

Jennifer L. Truman, Ph.D., and 
Lynn Langton, Ph.D., BJS Statisticians

In 2013, U.S. residents age 12 or older experienced an estimated 6.1 
million violent victimizations and 16.8 million property victimizations, 
according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National Crime 
Victimization Survey (NCVS). After two consecutive years of increases, 
the overall violent crime rate (which includes rape or sexual assault, 
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault) declined slightly, from 
26.1 victimizations per 1,000 persons in 2012 to 23.2 per 1,000 in 2013 
(figure 1). The slight decline in simple assault accounted for about 80% 
of the change in total violence. The rate of violent crime in 2013 was 
similar to the rate in 2011 (22.6 per 1,000). Since 1993, the rate of 
violent crime has declined from 79.8 to 23.2 victimizations per 1,000 
persons age 12 or older.

The overall property crime rate (which includes household burglary, 
theft, and motor vehicle theft) decreased from 155.8 victimizations per 
1,000 households in 2012 to 131.4 victimizations per 1,000 in 2013. The 
decline in theft accounted for the majority of the decrease in property 
crime. Since 1993, the rate of property crime has declined from 351.8 to 
131.4 victimizations per 1,000 households.

Violent crime
***************

* The rate of violent crime declined slightly from 26.1 victimizations 
per 1,000 persons in 2012 to 23.2 per 1,000 in 2013.

* No statistically significant change was detected in the rate of 
serious violent crime (rape or sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated 
assault) from 2012 to 2013 (7.3 per 1,000).

* From 2012 to 2013, no statistically significant changes occurred in 
the rates of domestic violence, intimate partner violence, violence 
resulting in an injury, or violence involving a firearm.

* Violent crimes committed by a stranger decreased from 10.3 per 1,000 
in 2012 to 7.9 per 1,000 in 2013.

* In 2013, 46% of violent victimizations and 61% of serious violent 
victimizations were reported to police.

Property crime
*****************

* The rate of property crime decreased from 155.8 victimizations per 
1,000 households in 2012 to 131.4 per 1,000 in 2013.

Prevalence of crime
*********************

* In 2013, 1.2% of all persons age 12 or older (3 million persons) 
experienced at least one violent victimization. About 0.4% (1.1 million 
persons) experienced at least one serious violent victimization.

* The prevalence rate of violent victimization declined from 1.4% of all 
persons age 12 or older in 2012 to 1.2% in 2013.

* In 2013, 9% of all households (11.5 million households) experienced 
one or more property victimizations.
**************************************************

***************************************
No significant change occurred in the 
rate of serious violent crime 
from 2012 to 2013
***************************************

There was no statistically significant change in the rate of serious 
violent crime—defined as rape or sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated 
assault—from 2012 (8.0 per 1,000) to 2013 (7.3 per 1,000) (table 1). In 
2013, the rates of total violent crime and serious violent crime were 
lower than the rates observed a decade earlier in 2004.

**************************************************

**********************************
The National Crime Victimization 
Survey (NCVS)
**********************************

The NCVS collects information on nonfatal crimes reported and not 
reported to the police against persons age 12 or older from a nationally 
representative sample of U.S. households. Initial NCVS interviews are 
conducted in person with subsequent interviews conducted either in 
person or by phone. In 2013, the response rate was 84% for households 
and 88% for eligible persons. The NCVS produces national rates and 
levels of violent and property victimization, as well as information on 
the characteristics of crimes and victims, and the consequences of 
victimization. Since NCVS is based on interviews with victims, it does 
not measure homicide.

The NCVS measures the violent crimes of rape or sexual assault, robbery, 
aggravated assault, and simple assault. The NCVS classifies rape, sexual 
assault, robbery, and aggravated assault as serious violent crimes. 
Property crimes include household burglary, motor vehicle theft, and 
theft. The survey also measures personal larceny, which includes 
pickpocketing and purse snatching. For additional estimates not included 
in this report, see the NCVS Victimization Analysis Tool (NVAT) on the 
BJS website.

Victimization is the basic unit of analysis used throughout most of this 
report. A victimization is a crime as it affects one person or 
household. For personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal to 
the number of victims present during a criminal incident. The number of 
victimizations may be greater than the number of incidents because more 
than one person may be victimized during an incident. Each crime against 
a household is counted as having a single victim—the affected household.

The victimization rate is a measure of the occurrence of victimizations 
among a specified population group. For personal crimes, the 
victimization rate is based on the number of victimizations per 1,000 
residents age 12 or older. For household crimes, the victimization rate 
is calculated using the number of incidents per 1,000 households.
Estimates are presented for 2013, 2012, and then for 2004, the 10-year 
change.
**************************************************

**********************************
Violence committed by a stranger 
decreased from 2012 to 2013
**********************************

The rate of domestic violence—crime committed by intimate partners and 
family members—remained flat from 2012 to 2013 (4.2 per 1,000). No 
measurable change was detected from 2012 to 2013 in rates of intimate 
partner violence (2.8 per 1,000), which includes victimizations 
committed by current or former spouses, boyfriends, or girlfriends. 
Violent victimizations committed by a stranger decreased from 10.3 
victimizations per 1,000 persons in 2012 to 7.9 per 1,000 in 2013. The 
rates of domestic violence, intimate partner violence, and violence 
committed by a stranger in 2013 were lower than rates in 2004. No 
statistically significant difference was found in the rates of serious 
violent crime involving weapons (4.4 per 1,000) or resulting in injury 
to the victim (2.8 per 1,000) from 2012 to 2013. The rate of serious 
violent crime involving weapons in 2013 was lower than the rate in 2004.

**********************************
No statistically significant 
change occurred in firearm 
violence from 2012 to 2013
**********************************

There was no statistically significant change in the rate of firearm 
violence from 2012 (1.8 per 1,000) to 2013 (1.3 per 1,000) (table 2). 
The rate of firearm violence in 2013 was slightly lower than the rate in 
2004 (1.9 per 1,000). In 2013, there were 332,950 nonfatal firearm 
victimizations, compared to 460,720 in 2012. In 2013, about 75% of all 
serious violent crimes that involved a firearm were reported to police. 
There was no measurable change in the percentage of firearm violence 
reported to police from 2012 to 2013.

**********************************
Thefts accounted for the majority 
of the decrease in property crime
**********************************

After increasing for 2 years, the number and rate of 
property crime victimization decreased from 2012 to 2013 
(table 3). The rate of property crime victimization decreased from 155.8 
victimizations per 1,000 households in 2012 to 131.4 per 1,000 in 2013, 
and was driven primarily by a decrease in theft. The rate of theft 
decreased from 120.9 victimizations per 1,000 households in 2012 to 
100.5 per 1,000 in 2013. The rate of household burglary decreased from 
29.9 victimizations per 1,000 households in 2012 to 25.7 per 1,000 in 
2013, while no measurable change occurred in the rate of motor vehicle 
theft during the same period (about 5 per 1,000). In 2013, the rates of 
property crime, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft were lower than 
the rates in 2004.

**************************************************

**********************
Prevalence of crime
**********************

Annual estimates of a population’s risk for criminal victimization can 
be examined using victimization rates or prevalence rates. Historically, 
BJS reports using NCVS data rely on victimization rates, which measure 
the extent to which victimizations occur in a specified population 
during a specific time. Victimization rates are used throughout this 
bulletin. For crimes affecting persons, NCVS victimization rates are 
estimated by dividing the number of victimizations that occur during a 
specified time (T) by the population at risk for those victimizations 
and multiplying the rate by 1,000.

              Number of victimizations experienced 
              by a specified population T
Victimization rate T = 
              Number of persons in the specified 
              populationT

Prevalence rates also describe the level of victimization but are based 
on the number of unique persons (or households) in the population who 
experienced at least one victimization during a specified time. The key 
distinction between a victimization rate and a prevalence rate is 
whether the numerator consists of the number of victimizations or the 
number of victims. For example, a person who experienced two robberies 
on separate occasions within the past year would be counted twice in the 
victimization rate but counted once in the prevalence rate. Prevalence 
rates are estimated by dividing the number of victims in the specified 
population by the total number of persons in the population and 
multiplying the rate by 100. This is the percentage of the population 
victimized at least once in a given period.

           Number of victims in a specified population T
Prevalence rate T = 
           Number of persons in the specified populationT

Victimization and prevalence rates may also be produced for household 
crimes, such as burglary. In these instances, the numerators and 
denominators are adjusted to reflect households rather than persons. To 
better understand the percentage of the population that is victimized at 
least once in a given period, prevalence rates are presented by type of 
crime and certain demographic characteristics. (For further information 
about measuring prevalence in the NCVS, see Measuring the Prevalence of 
Crime with the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCJ 241656, BJS web, 
September 2013).

**********************************
In 2013, 0.4% of all persons age 
2 or older experienced serious
violence
**********************************

In 2013, 1.2% of all persons age 12 or older (3 million persons) 
experienced at least one violent victimization (table 4). During the 
same period, about 0.4% of all persons age 12 or older (1.1 million 
persons) experienced at least one serious violent victimization (rape or 
sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault). The prevalence rate of 
violent victimization declined from 1.4% of all persons age 12 or older 
in 2012 to 1.2% in 2013. No measurable change occurred in the prevalence 
rate of serious violent victimization from 2012 to 2013. During the same 
period, prevalence rates of robbery (0.1%) and simple assault (0.8%) 
also declined.

Less than 1% of all persons age 12 or older experienced one or more 
domestic violence (0.2%) or intimate partner violence (0.1%) 
victimizations in 2013. No measurable change occurred in the prevalence 
rates of domestic violence and intimate partner violence from 2012 to 
2013. The prevalence of violence committed by strangers declined from 
0.6% of all persons age 12 or older in 2012 to 0.5% in 2013.

In 2013, 9.0% of all households (11.5 million households) experienced 
one or more property victimizations. The prevalence rate of property 
victimization declined from 10.4% in 2012 to 9.0% in 2013. During the 
same period, the prevalence of household burglary and theft also 
declined. Similar to the property victimization rate, the decline in the 
prevalence rate of theft accounted for the majority of the decline in 
the prevalence rate of property victimization.

**********************************
Persons ages 12 to 17 had the 
highest prevalence of violence 
(2.2%)of all age groups in 2013
**********************************

In 2013, 1.2% of all males age 12 or older (1.6 million males) and 1.1% 
of all females (1.5 million females) experienced one or more violent 
victimizations (table 5). While the prevalence rate declined for both 
males and females from 2012 to 2013, a slightly higher percentage of 
males (1.2%) than females (1.1%) were victims of one or more violent 
crimes in 2013.

In 2013, about 57,300 Asians experienced one or more violent crimes 
during the year and had the lowest prevalence rate (0.4%) of the U.S. 
population. The percentage of the population who experienced violence 
was highest among American Indians or Alaska Natives (2.8%), accounting 
for 38,310 crime victims, and persons of two or more races (3.6%), 
accounting for 114,190 crime victims. Although there were over 3 times 
more white victims (1.9 million) than black (430,380) and Hispanic 
(540,130) victims in 2013, blacks (1.3%) and Hispanics (1.3%) had higher 
prevalence rates than whites (1.1%). This was a shift from 2004, when 
Hispanics (1.2%) had a lower prevalence rate than both whites (1.5%) and 
blacks (1.7%).

The prevalence of violence declined for whites, blacks, and Asians from 
2012 to 2013. Among Hispanics and American Indians or Alaska Natives, 
there was no significant change in the percentage of the population that 
experienced one or more violent crimes during the year. Among persons of 
two or more races, the prevalence rate increased from 2.0% of the 
population experiencing violence in 2012 to 3.6% in 2013.

In 2013, 545,370 persons ages 12 to 17, or about 2.2% of all persons 
ages 12 to 17, experienced at least one violent crime. Persons ages 12 
to 17 had the highest prevalence of violence of all age groups. In 
comparison, persons age 65 or older had the lowest prevalence rate with 
0.3% of the population experiencing one or more violent crimes. From 
2012 to 2013, the prevalence of violent crime declined for persons ages 
18 to 24, ages 25 to 34, and age 65 or older.

Persons who were never married had a higher prevalence rate of violence 
(1.8%) than persons who were married (0.6%). Persons who were separated 
had the highest prevalence of violence, with 3.3% experiencing one or 
more violent crimes. From 2012 to 2013, the prevalence of violence 
declined among both persons who were never married and persons who were 
married, but the rate remained flat for persons of all other marital 
statuses.
**************************************************

***************************************
In 2013, 46% of violent victimizations 
were reported to police
***************************************

The NCVS allows for an examination of crimes reported and not reported 
to police. Victims may not report the victimization for a variety of 
reasons, including fear of reprisal or getting the offender in trouble, 
believing that police would not or could not do anything to help, and 
believing the crime to be a personal issue or trivial. Police 
notification can come from the victim, a third party (including 
witnesses, other victims, household members, or other officials, such as 
school officials or workplace managers), or police being at the scene of 
the incident. Police notification may occur during or immediately 
following a criminal incident or at a later date.

From 2012 to 2013, there was no statistically significant change in the 
percentage of violent and serious violent victimizations reported to 
police (table 6). In 2013, 46% of violent victimizations and 61% of 
serious violent victimizations were reported to police. A greater 
percentage of robbery (68%) and aggravated assault (64%) were reported 
to police than simple assault (38%) and rape or sexual assault (35%) 
victimizations.

From 2012 to 2013, the percentage of property victimizations reported to 
police increased from 34% to 36%. The percentage of reported thefts 
increased from 26% to 29% during the same period, accounting for the 
majority of the increase in the overall percentage of property 
victimizations reported to police. No measurable change was detected in 
the percentage of burglaries and motor vehicle thefts reported to police 
from 2012 to 2013. Similar to previous years, a larger percentage of 
motor vehicle thefts (75%) than burglaries (57%) and other thefts (29%) 
were reported to police in 2013.

**********************************
Rates of property crime reported 
and not reported to police 
declined from 2012 to 2013
**********************************

From 2012 to 2013, no differences were detected in the overall rates of 
violence reported and not reported to police (table 7). Among violent 
and serious violent victimizations reported to police, the only 
significant change from 2012 to 2013 was in the rate of violence 
committed by a stranger, which declined slightly from 5.1 to 3.9 
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older. There was no 
significant change in the rates of domestic violence or intimate partner 
violence reported to police from 2012 to 2013. Among violent 
victimizations not reported to police, the rates of robbery, violence 
and serious violence committed by a stranger, and serious violent crime 
involving weapons declined from 2012 to 2013. The rates of robbery 
declined slightly from 1.2 victimizations per 1,000 in 2012 to 0.8 per 
1,000 in 2013. The rates of unreported violence committed by a stranger 
declined slightly from 5.0 per 1,000 in 2012 to 3.8 per 1,000 in 2013. 
For other types of violence, the rates of unreported victimization were 
similar in 2012 and 2013.

In comparison, overall rates of property crime reported and not reported 
to police declined from 2012 to 2013. The overall rate of property crime 
reported to police decreased from 52.2 to 47.4 victimizations per 1,000 
households. This decline was driven largely by a decrease in thefts 
reported to police from 2012 (31.9 per 1,000) to 2013 (28.7 per 1,000). 
The rate of unreported property crime declined from 101.9 victimizations 
per 1,000 households in 2012 to 83.1 per 1,000 in 2013. Among specific 
crime types that went unreported, the rate of unreported burglaries 
declined from 13.2 per 1,000 in 2012 to 10.9 in 2013, and the rate of 
unreported theft decreased from 87.7 to 71.0 victimizations per 1,000 
households. There was no change in the rate of reported or unreported 
motor vehicle theft victimizations from 2012 to 2013.

**********************************
In 2013, 10% of violent crime 
victims received assistance from 
a victim service agency
**********************************

Victim service agencies are publicly or privately funded organizations 
that provide victims with support and services to aid their physical and 
emotional recovery, offer protection from future victimizations, guide 
them through the criminal justice system process, and assist them in 
obtaining restitution. In 2013, about 10% of victims of violent crime 
received assistance from a victim service agency, which was not 
statistically different from 2012 (table 8). There was also no 
statistical difference in the percentage of victims who received 
assistance in 2004 compared to 2013. In 2013, a greater percentage of 
victims of serious violence (14%) received assistance than victims of 
simple assault (8%).

**********************************
Violent crime decreased for males 
but did not change significantly 
for females
**********************************

From 2012 to 2013, the rate of violent victimization for males declined 
from 29.1 victimizations per 1,000 males to 23.7 per 1,000 (table 9). 
Unlike in 2012 when males had a higher rate of victimization than 
females, there was no significant difference in male (23.7 per 1,000) 
and female (22.7 per 1,000) violent victimization rates in 2013.

The rate of violent victimization for blacks declined from 34.2 
victimizations per 1,000 in 2012 to 25.1 per 1,000 in 2013. Both the 
rates for whites and Hispanics remained flat from 2012 to 2013. Unlike 
in 2012, the rates of violent crime for blacks (25.1 per 1,000), whites 
(22.2 per 1,000), and Hispanics (24.8 per 1,000) were similar in 2013 
due to the decline in the rates for blacks.

From 2012 to 2013, violent victimization rates declined for persons ages 
35 to 49, from 29.1 to 20.3 victimizations per 1,000. There was no 
measurable change in the rates of violent or serious violent crime for 
all other age groups. In 2013, persons ages 12 to 17 (52.1 per 1,000) 
had a higher rate of violent victimization than persons in other age 
groups.

With the exception of persons who were married, rates of violent 
victimization remained flat from 2012 to 2013 for persons of all marital 
statuses. Violent victimization rates for persons who were married 
decreased from 13.5 victimizations per 1,000 persons in 2012 to 10.7 per 
1,000 in 2013. Persons who were married (10.7 per 1,000) had a lower 
rate of violence than persons who were never married (36.3 per 1,000), 
divorced (34.4 per 1,000), or separated (73.2 per 1,000). Persons who 
were separated had the highest rate of violence in 2013. The NCVS 
collects information on a respondent’s marital status at the time of the 
interview but does not obtain marital status at the time of the 
incident. For example, persons who are separated may have experienced a 
victimization while married.

Violent victimization in urban areas declined from 2012 to 2013
From 2012 to 2013, the rate of violent victimization for persons living 
in the South declined slightly, from 22.1 victimizations per 1,000 
persons to 18.0 per 1,000 (table 10). The rate of violence in the West 
declined from 35.5 victimizations per 1,000 persons to 27.3 per 1,000. 
The declines in these two regions largely accounted for the slight 
decline in the rate of overall violence, as there were no statistically 
significant changes in rates of violent victimization in the Northeast 
or Midwest from 2012 to 2013. There was a slight increase in the rate of 
serious violence in the Northeast, from 4.6 victimizations per 1,000 in 
2012 to 7.8 per 1,000 in 2013, but no other regions experienced a change 
in serious violence.

Urban areas accounted for most of the slight decline in the overall rate 
of violent victimization. The rate of violence declined in urban areas, 
from 32.4 to 25.9 victimizations per 1,000. There was no measurable 
change in the rates of violent victimization in suburban or rural areas 
from 2012 to 2013. Rates of serious violence did not show a 
statistically significant change in any of the three areas.

From 2012 to 2013, property crime rates decreased in all regions of the 
country and across urban, suburban, and rural areas. In 2013, property 
crime rates were highest in the West (182.1 per 1,000) and lowest in the 
Northeast (92.1 per 1,000). Urban areas (165.3 per 1,000) had a higher 
rate of property crime than suburban (115.3 per 1,000) and rural (109.4 
per 1,000) areas.

**************************************************

**********************************
The NCVS and UCR showed similar 
Declines in property crime from 
2012 to 2013
**********************************

In the first half of 2013, preliminary findings from the FBI’s Uniform 
Crime Reporting (UCR) program showed a decline in the number of violent 
and property crimes (table 11). The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ 
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) also showed a significant 
decline in property crime victimization from 2012 to 2013 (down 15%) and 
a slight decline in violent victimizations (down 10%).

Because the NCVS and UCR measure an overlapping, but not identical, set 
of offenses and use different methodologies, congruity between the 
estimates is not expected. Throughout the 40-year history of the NCVS, 
both programs have generally demonstrated similar year-to-year increases 
or decreases in the levels of overall violent and property crimes. 
However, in recent years, this has not always been the case for certain 
crime types.

As measured by the UCR, violent crime includes murder and nonnegligent 
manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Property 
crime includes burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft. The UCR 
measures crimes known to the police, occurring against both persons and 
businesses. The FBI obtains data on crimes from law enforcement 
agencies, while the NCVS collects data through interviews with victims. 
Additional information about the differences between the two programs 
can be found in The Nation’s Two Crime Measures (NCJ 246832, BJS web, 
September 2014).

Significant methodological and definitional differences exist between 
the NCVS and UCR:

* The NCVS obtains estimates of crimes both reported and not reported to 
the police, while the UCR collects data on crimes known to and recorded 
by the police.
*
The UCR includes homicide, arson, and commercial crimes, while the NCVS 
excludes these crime types.

* The UCR excludes simple assault and sexual assault, which are included 
in the NCVS.***Fotnote *Simple assaults include attacks or attempted 
attacks without a weapon resulting in either no injury or minor injury. 
Sexual assaults include attacks or attempted attacks generally involving 
unwanted sexual contact between the victim and offender that may or may 
not involve force***.

* The NCVS data are estimates from a nationally representative sample of 
U.S. households, while the UCR data are estimates based on counts of 
crimes reported by law enforcement jurisdictions.

* The NCVS excludes crimes against children age 11 or younger, persons 
in institutions (e.g., nursing homes and correctional institutions), and 
may exclude highly mobile populations and homeless people. However, 
victimizations against these persons are included in the UCR.

Given these differences, the two measures of crime should complement 
each other and provide a more comprehensive picture of crime in the 
United States.

In the first half of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, there 
were consistent declines in UCR violent and property crimes known to 
police across all crime types. The number of NCVS property crimes 
reported to police also declined 8% from 2012 to 2013, while the 
apparent decline in the NCVS estimate of overall violent crime was not 
statistically significant. Among other NCVS violent crime types, the 
number of victimizations reported to police did not change significantly 
from 2012 to 2013. However, unlike declines in the UCR’s semiannual 
estimates of forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, the general 
direction of change in the NCVS estimates of rape and sexual assault, 
robbery, and aggravated assault appeared to be positive.

Survey coverage
****************

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an annual data 
collection conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (BJS). The NCVS is a self-report survey in which interviewed 
persons are asked about the number and characteristics of victimizations 
experienced during the prior 6 months. The NCVS collects information on 
nonfatal personal crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated 
and simple assault, and personal larceny) and household property crimes 
(burglary, motor vehicle theft, and other theft) both reported and not 
reported to police. In addition to providing annual level and change 
estimates on criminal victimization, the NCVS is the primary source of 
information on the nature of criminal victimization incidents.

Survey respondents provide information about themselves (e.g., age, sex, 
race and Hispanic origin, marital status, education level, and income) 
and whether they experienced a victimization. The NCVS collects 
information for each victimization incident about the offender (e.g., 
age, race and Hispanic origin, sex, and victim–offender relationship), 
characteristics of the crime (including time and place of occurrence, 
use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic consequences), whether 
the crime was reported to police, reasons the crime was or was not 
reported, and victim experiences with the criminal justice system.

The NCVS is administered to persons age 12 or older from a nationally 
representative sample of households in the United States. The NCVS 
defines a household as a group of persons who all reside at a sampled 
address. Persons are considered household members when the sampled 
address is their usual place of residence at the time of the interview 
and when they have no usual place of residence elsewhere. Once selected, 
households remain in the sample for 3 years, and eligible persons in 
these households are interviewed every 6 months either in person or over 
the phone for a total of seven interviews.

All first interviews are conducted in person with subsequent interviews 
conducted either in person or by phone. New households rotate into the 
sample on an ongoing basis to replace outgoing households that have been 
in the sample for the 3-year period. The sample includes persons living 
in group quarters, such as dormitories, rooming houses, and religious 
group dwellings, and excludes persons living in military barracks and 
institutional settings such as correctional or hospital facilities, and 
homeless persons.

Nonresponse and weighting 
adjustments
**************************

In 2013, 90,630 households and 160,040 persons age 12 or older were 
interviewed for the NCVS. Each household was interviewed twice during 
the year. The response rate was 84% for households and 88% for eligible 
persons. Victimizations that occurred outside of the United States were 
excluded from this report. In 2013, less than 1% of the unweighted 
victimizations occurred outside of the United States and were excluded 
from the analyses.

Estimates in this report use data from the 1993 to 2013 NCVS data files, 
weighted to produce annual estimates of victimization for persons age 12 
or older living in U.S. households. Because the NCVS relies on a sample 
rather than a census of the entire U.S. population, weights are designed 
to inflate sample point estimates to known population totals and to 
compensate for survey nonresponse and other aspects of the sample 
design.

The NCVS data files include both person and household weights. Person 
weights provide an estimate of the population represented by each person 
in the sample. Household weights provide an estimate of the U.S. 
household population represented by each household in the sample. After 
proper adjustment, both household and person weights are also typically 
used to form the denominator in calculations of crime rates.

Victimization weights used in this analysis account for the number of 
persons present during an incident and for high-frequency repeat 
victimizations (i.e., series victimizations). Series victimizations are 
similar in type but occur with such frequency that a victim is unable to 
recall each individual event or describe each event in detail. Survey 
procedures allow NCVS interviewers to identify and classify these 
similar victimizations as series victimizations and to collect detailed 
information on only the most recent incident in the series.

The weight counts series incidents as the actual number of incidents 
reported by the victim, up to a maximum of 10 incidents. Including 
series victimizations in national rates results in large increases in 
the level of violent victimization; however, trends in violence are 
generally similar, regardless of whether series victimizations are 
included. In 2013, series incidents accounted for about 1% of all 
victimizations and 4% of all violent victimizations. Weighting series 
incidents as the number of incidents up to a maximum of 10 incidents 
produces more reliable estimates of crime levels, while the cap at 10 
minimizes the effect of extreme outliers on rates. Additional 
information on the series enumeration is detailed in the report Methods 
for Counting High-Frequency Repeat Victimizations in the National Crime 
Victimization Survey (NCJ 237308, BJS web, April 2012).

Standard error computations
****************************

When national estimates are derived from a sample, as with the NCVS, it 
is important to use caution when comparing one estimate to another 
estimate or when comparing estimates over time. Although one estimate 
may be larger than another, estimates based on a sample have some degree 
of sampling error. The sampling error of an estimate depends on several 
factors, including the amount of variation in the responses and the size 
of the sample. When the sampling error around an estimate is taken into 
account, the estimates that appear different may not be statistically 
different.

One measure of the sampling error associated with an estimate is the 
standard error. The standard error can vary from one estimate to the 
next. Generally, an estimate with a small standard error provides a more 
reliable approximation of the true value than an estimate with a large 
standard error. Estimates with relatively large standard errors are 
associated with less precision and reliability and should be interpreted 
with caution.

To generate standard errors around numbers and estimates from the NCVS, 
the Census Bureau produced generalized variance function (GVF) 
parameters for BJS. The GVFs take into account aspects of the NCVS 
complex sample design and represent the curve fitted to a selection of 
individual standard errors based on the Jackknife Repeated Replication 
technique. The GVF parameters were used to generate standard errors for 
each point estimate (e.g., counts, percentages, and rates) in this 
report.

BJS conducted tests to determine whether differences in estimated 
numbers, percentages, and rates in this report were statistically 
significant once sampling error was taken into account. Using 
statistical programs developed specifically for the NCVS, all 
comparisons in the text were tested for significance. The primary test 
procedure was the Student’s t-statistic, which tests the difference 
between two sample estimates. Differences described as higher, lower, or 
different passed a test at the 0.05 level of statistical significance 
(95% confidence level). Differences described as somewhat, slightly, or 
marginally different, or with some indication of difference, passed a 
test at the 0.10 level of statistical significance (90% confidence 
level). Caution is required when comparing estimates not explicitly 
discussed in this report.

Data users can use the estimates and the standard errors of the 
estimates provided in this report to generate a confidence interval 
around the estimate as a measure of the margin of error. The following 
example illustrates how standard errors can be used to generate 
confidence intervals:

   *According to the NCVS, in 2013, the violent victimization rate among 
persons age 12 or older was 23.2 per 1,000 persons (see table 1). Using 
the GVFs, it was determined that the estimated victimization rate has a 
standard error of 1.6 (see appendix table 2). A confidence interval 
around the estimate was generated by multiplying the standard errors by 
±1.96 (the t-score of a normal, two-tailed distribution that excludes 
2.5% at either end of the distribution). Therefore, the 95% confidence 
interval around the 23.2 estimate from 2013 is 23.2 ± (1.6 X 1.96) or 
(20.0 to 26.3). In others words, if different samples using the same 
procedures were taken from the U.S. population in 2013, 95% of the time 
the violent victimization rate would fall between 20.1 and 26.3 per 
1,000 persons.

In this report, BJS also calculated a coefficient of variation (CV) for 
all estimates, representing the ratio of the standard error to the 
estimate. CVs provide a measure of reliability and a means to compare 
the precision of estimates across measures with differing levels or 
metrics. In cases in which the CV was greater than 50%, or the 
unweighted sample had 10 or fewer cases, the estimate was noted with a 
“!” symbol (Interpret data with caution. Estimate based on 10 or fewer 
sample cases, or the coefficient of variation is greater than 50%).

Methodological changes to 
the NCVS in 2006
***************************

Methodological changes implemented in 2006 may have affected the crime 
estimates for that year to such an extent that they are not comparable 
to estimates from other years. Evaluation of 2007 and later data from 
the NCVS conducted by BJS and the Census Bureau found a high degree of 
confidence that estimates for 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 
2013 are consistent with and comparable to estimates for 2005 and 
previous years. The reports, Criminal Victimization, 2006, NCJ 219413,
