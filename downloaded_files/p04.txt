The total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction 
of Federal or State adult correctional authorities 
was 1,496,629 at yearend 2004. During the year the
States added 20,759 prisoners and the Federal prison 
system added 7,269 prisoners. Overall, the Nation=s 
prison population grew 1.9%, which was less than 
the average annual growth of 3.2% since yearend 
1995.  

The rate of incarceration in prison at yearend 
2004 was 486 sentenced inmates per 100,000 U.S. 
residents -- up from 411 in 1995. About 1 in every
109 men and 1 in every 1,563 women were sentenced 
prisoners under the jurisdiction of State or
Federal authorities.

Overall, the United States incarcerated 2,267,787
persons at yearend 2004. This total represents
persons held in -- 
-- Federal and State prisons
  (1,421,911, which excludes State and Federal
  prisoners in local jails)
-- territorial prisons (15,757)
-- local jails (713,990)
-- facilities operated by or exclusively for the
Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement
(9,788)
-- military facilities (2,177) 
-- jails in Indian country (1,826 as of midyear 
2003)
-- juvenile facilities (102,338 as of October 
2002).

1 in every 138 U.S. residents in prison 
or jail at yearend 2004  

On December 31, 2004, 1,421,911 inmates were in
the custody of State and Federal prison authorities,
and 713,990 were in the custody of local jail
authorities. (Custody is defined on page 11.) During
2004 the total incarcerated population increased
54,321, or 2.6% -- less than the average annual
increase since 1995 (3.4%). Including inmates in
public and privately operated facilities, the 
number in State prisons increased 1.8% during 
2004; the number in Federal prisons, 5.5%; and 
in local jails, 3.3%. 

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail 
was 724 inmates per 100,000 residents in 2004, 
up from 601 in 1995. At yearend 2004, 1 in 
every 138 U.S. residents were incarcerated in 
State or Federal prison or a local jail.

U.S. prison population rose 1.9% 
during 2004 

In 2004 the growth in the number of inmates under
State or Federal jurisdiction (1.9%) was less 
than the percentage increase recorded for 2003 
(2.0%). (Jurisdiction is defined on page 11.) The 
population under the jurisdiction of State and 
Federal authorities increased by 28,028 inmates 
during 2004, smaller than the  increase in 2003 
(up 28,457). Since December 31, 1995, the U.S. 
prison population has grown an average of 46,220 
inmates per year (3.2%).

The Federal prison population totaled 180,328 at
yearend 2004, up from  173,059 at yearend 2003.
About 12% of all prisoners held were serving 
time in the Federal system. 

-----------------------------------------
At yearend 2004 15,757 inmates 
held in U.S. Territories

The U.S. Territories and Commonwealths --
American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands,
Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands -- reported 
15,757 inmates in the custody of their prison 
systems at yearend 2004, a decrease of 4.5% 
since 2003.

Prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year 
totaled 12,185 (more than three-quarters of 
the total territorial prison population).

Relative to the resident populations in the 
Territories, the rate of incarceration was 
283 prisoners per 100,000 residents. 

Of the 5 Territories, the U.S. Virgin Islands 
had the highest prison incarceration rate(392 
inmates per 100,000 residents), followed by 

Puerto Rico (with 292). Puerto Rico, the largest 
of the Territories, also held the largest number 
of sentenced prisoners, 11,374 at yearend 2004.
------------------------------------------------

10 States reported increases of at 
least 5% during 2004; 11 States had 
decreases 

Between January 1 and December 31, 2004,
Minnesota experienced the largest increase in 
prison population (up 11.4%), followed by Idaho 
(up 11.1%), Georgia (up 8.3%), and Nevada 
(up 7.8%). Eleven States experienced a decline. 
Alabama had the largest decline (down 7.3%), 
followed by Rhode Island (down 2.8%), New York 
(down 2.2%), and Maryland (down 2.1%). In absolute 
numbers, four jurisdictions grew by at least 
2,000 inmates during 2004. The Federal system (up 
7,269), experienced the largest growth, followed 
by Georgia (up 3,896), Florida (up 3,521), and 
California (up 2,069). Alabama and New York had 
the largest drop in inmates(down 2,026 and 1,447, 
respectively). 

Overall, the number of inmates under jurisdiction 
in the West grew 2.5%, followed by that in the 
South (2.1%) and the Midwest (1.3%). The number 
of inmates declined in the Northeast (down 1.4%). 
In the same period the Federal system grew 4.2%.

The prison incarceration rate 
reached 486 per 100,000 residents 
in 2004, up from 411 in 1995

Eleven States exceeded the national prison
incarceration rate of 486 per 100,000 residents, 
led by Louisiana (816), Texas (694), Mississippi 
(669), and Oklahoma (649). Eight States, 
including Maine (148), Minnesota (171), and 
Rhode Island (175), had rates that were less 
than half the national rate.
 
Since 1995 the sentenced inmate population in 
State prisons has had an average growth of 3.1% 
per year. During this period 16 States had an 
average annual growth of at least 5%, led by 
North Dakota (up 9.6%), Wisconsin (up 8.5%), 
and West Virginia (up 8.2%). Between 1995 and 
2004 the Federal system grew an average of 
7.4% per year, an average annual increase of 
8,386 inmates. 

During 2004 the number of female 
prisoners rose 4.0%-- more than 
twice the 1.8%-increase among men 

During 2004 the number of women under the 
jurisdiction of State or Federal prison authorities
increased 4.0% The number of men in prison rose
1.8%. At yearend 2004, 104,848 women and 
1,391,781 men were in prison. From 1995 to 2004
the annual growth of the female inmate population
averaged 4.8%, higher than the 3.1% increase in
male inmate population. By yearend 2004 women
accounted for 7.0% of all prisoners, up from 6.1% 
in 1995 and 5.7% in 1990.  

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident
population, men were over 14 times more likely 
than women to be incarcerated in a State or Federal
prison. At yearend 2004 there were 64 sentenced
female inmates per 100,000 women in the United
States, compared to 920 sentenced male inmates 
per 100,000 men.

Since 1995 the total number of male prisoners has
grown nearly 32%; the number of female prisoners,
53%. At yearend 2004, 1 in every 1,563 women and
1 in every 109 men were incarcerated in a State 
or Federal prison.

Over a third of female prisoners held 
in the 3 largest jurisdictions

Texas (13,958), the Federal system (12,164), and
California (11,188) held more than a third of all
female inmates. Oklahoma (129 sentenced female
inmates per 100,000 female residents), Mississippi
(107), and Louisiana (103) had the highest female
incarceration rates. States with the lowest female
incarceration rates were concentrated in the
Northeast -- Rhode Island and Massachusetts (each
with 11 sentenced female prisoners per 100,000
female residents), and Maine and New Hampshire
(both with 18). 

Eleven States had an average annual increase of
more than 10% between 1995 and 2004, led by North
Dakota (18.0%), Montana (17.4%), and West Virginia
(15.1%). During this period the State female prison
population increased an average of 4.7% per year;
the Federal female prison population increased 
5.7% per year.

Privately operated prisons held 6.6% 
of State and Federal inmates in 2004

At yearend 2004, 34 States and the Federal system
reported a total of 98,901 prisoners held in 
privately operated facilities. Private facilities 
held 5.6% of all State prisoners and 13.7% of 
Federal prisoners. Among States, Texas (with 
16,668 State inmates housed in private facilities) 
and Oklahoma (with 5,905) reported the largest 
populations in 2004. 

Six States had at least 25% of their prison 
population housed in private prisons, led by New 
Mexico(42%), Alaska(31%), Montana (30%), Wyoming 
and Hawaii(both 28%), and Oklahoma(25%). At 
yearend 2004, 8.1% of State inmates in the South 
and 6.4% in the West were in privately operated 
facilities, compared to 2.0% in the Northeast 
and 1.4% in the Midwest.

Since yearend 2000 the number of Federal inmates
in private facilities has increased 60%, while the
number held in State facilities has decreased 1.3%.
As a percentage of all inmates under State and
Federal jurisdiction, the number held in private
facilities has remained stable (6.6%).  

In 2004 local jails held 5% of State 
and Federal prisoners 

At the end of 2004, 32 States and the Federal 
system reported a total of 74,378 State and 
Federal prisoners held in jails or other 
facilities operated by county or local 
authorities. These inmates held in local jails
represented 5% of all prisoners in 2004.  

Louisiana had the largest percentage of its State
inmate population housed in local jails (47%). 
Four other States -- led by Kentucky (29%) and
Tennessee (25%) -- had at least a fifth of their
population housed in local jail facilities.

About 85% of prisoners held in local jails were 
in the South (62,966). Overall, the South held 
10.5% of prisoners in local jails, followed by 
the West(1.8%), the Midwest (1.3%), and the 
Northeast (0.9%).

From yearend 2000 to 2004 the number of Federal
inmates held in local jails declined by about 
50%, while the number of State inmates in local 
jails rose about 20%.

24 States and Federal system 
prisons at or above highest capacity

To estimate the capacity of their prisons, 
jurisdictions were asked to supply three measures 
for capacity at yearend 2004: rated, operational, 
and design capacities. These measures were 
defined as follows:

Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates
assigned by a rating official to institutions 
within the jurisdiction.

Operational capacity is the number of inmates 
that can be accommodated, based on a facility's 
staff, existing programs, and services.

Design capacity is the number of inmates that
planners or architects intended for the facility. 

Twenty-one jurisdictions gave only 1 measure or 
the same figure for each measure. For the 28
jurisdictions with more than 1 reported type of
capacity, estimates of population as a percent 
of capacity are based on the highest and lowest 
figures provided. At yearend 2004, 25 States 
reported operating below 100% of their highest 
capacity, and 24 States and the Federal prison 
system, at 100% or more of their highest capacity. 

Mississippi, at 74% of its highest capacity, 
reported the lowest percent of capacity occupied. 
Alabama, 105% over lowest reported capacity, 
had the highest percent of capacity occupied. 
At yearend 2004 the Federal prison system was
operating at 40% over capacity. Overall, State 
prisons were operating between 99% of their 
highest capacity and 115% of their lowest 
capacity. 

60% of State and Federal inmates 
black or Hispanic at yearend 2004

At yearend 2004 black inmates represented an
estimated 41% of all inmates with a sentence 
of more than 1 year, while white inmates 
accounted for 34% and Hispanic inmates, 19%.

Although the total number of sentenced inmates rose
sharply (up 32% between 1995 and 2004), the racial
and Hispanic composition of the inmate population
changed only slightly. At yearend 2004 black males
(551,300) outnumbered white males (449,300) and
Hispanic males (260,600) among inmates with a
sentence of more than 1 year. More than 40% of all
sentenced male inmates were black.

Comparisons with previous estimates of inmates by
race and Hispanic origin are complicated by new
collection practices. Following guidelines 
provided by the Office of Management and Budget, 
estimates in 2004 were made separately for persons 
identifying with one race (97.1%) and those 
identifying with two or more races (2.9%). 
Adoption of these guidelines reduced the number 
and percentage of inmates identified as non-
Hispanic white and black.

An estimated 8.4% of black males, 
age 25-29, in prison in 2004

When incarceration rates are estimated separately 
by age group, black males in their twenties and 
thirties are found to have high rates relative to 
other groups. Expressed in terms of percentages, 
8.4% of black males age 25 to 29 were in prison 
on December 31, 2004, compared to 2.5% of Hispanic 
males and about 1.2% of white males in the same 
age group. Although incarceration rates drop with 
age, the percentage of black males age 45 to 54 in 
prison in 2004 was still nearly 3.3% -- higher 
than the highest rate (2.5%) among Hispanic males 
(age 25 to 29)and more than twice the highest rate 
(1.2%) among white males (age 25 to 29). 

Female incarceration rates, though substantially
lower than male incarceration rates at every age,
reveal similar racial and ethnic disparities. 
Black females (with an incarceration rate of 170 
per 100,000) were more than twice as likely as
Hispanic females (75 per 100,000) and 4 times as
likely as white females (42 per 100,000) to be in
prison on December 31, 2004. These differences
among white, black, and Hispanic females were
consistent across all age groups.

Violent offenders made up half of 
State prisoners in 2002

In absolute numbers, an estimated 624,900 inmates
in State prison at yearend 2002 (the latest available
data) were held for violent offenses: 148,300 for
murder, 170,900 for robbery, 116,900 for assault,
and 142,000 for rape and other sexual assaults. In
addition, 253,000 inmates were held for property
offenses, 265,000 for drug offenses, and 87,500 for
public-order offenses. 

Overall, the proportion of violent offenders 
increased from 46.5% in 1995 to 50.5% in 2002. 
Property offenders decreased from about 23% in 
1995 to 20.4% in 2002; drug offenders remained 
stable around 21%. 

Offenses of State prisoners 
varied by gender, race, and 
Hispanic origin

About half of male State prisoners were serving 
time for a violent offense in 2002, compared to 
a third of female prisoners. Women were more 
likely to be serving time for property and drug 
offenses (28.7% and 31.5%, respectively) than 
males (19.9% and 20.7%).

Offense types also varied by race and Hispanic
origin. Approximately half of white, black, and
Hispanic State inmates were violent offenders. 
White prisoners were more likely to be serving 
time for a property offense (26.4%), compared to 
blacks (17.6%) and Hispanics (15.7%). Drug 
offenders made up a larger portion of Hispanic 
State inmates (27.4%) than of black inmates 
(25.1%) or white inmates (14.8%).

Changing Federal prison population 
related to drug and immigration 
offenses

Prisoners sentenced for drug offenses constituted 
the largest group of Federal inmates (55%) in 2003,
down from 60% in 1995. On September 30, 2003, the
date of the latest available data in the Federal 
Justice Statistics Program, Federal prisons held 
86,972 sentenced drug offenders, compared to 
52,782 at yearend 1995. 

Between 1995 and 2003 the number of Federal inmates 
held for public-order offenses increased 170%, most 
of which was the increase in immigration offenses 
(up 394%). The number of immigration offenders 
rose from 3,420 in 1995 to 16,903 in 2003. 
Immigration violators represented over 10% of 
Federal inmates in 2003.

The number of weapons offenders held in Federal
prisons increased about 120% (from 7,446 to 
16,377)between 1995 and 2003 and represented 
about 10% of the inmate population in 2003.

Violent offenders under Federal jurisdiction 
increased 46% from 1995 to 2003, and accounted 
for almost 8% of the total growth during the 
period. Homicide offenders increased 146%, from 
1,068 in 1995 to 2,632 in 2003.

While the number of offenders in each major offense
category increased, the number incarcerated for a
drug offense accounted for the largest percentage 
of the total growth(49%), followed by public-order
offenders (38%).

------------------------------------------
The number of Immigration and Customs
detainees dropped 19% during 2004 

The U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE), reported 19,057 detainees 
on December 31, 2004, down from 23,514 at yearend
2003. Nearly two-thirds of these detainees(11,570)
were held in Federal and State prisons and local
jails, and about a third were held in ICE-operated
facilities (4,545) and private facilities under
exclusive contract to the ICE (1,678).

The number of detainees under ICE jurisdiction 
more than doubled between 1995 and 2004. This 
increase most affected State prisons, local jails, 
and other facilities maintaining intergovernmental 
agreements with ICE; they held 11,570 detainees in 
2004, up from 2,286 in 1995. 

Among the 19,057 ICE detainees for immigration
violations at yearend 2004, 10,931 had been
convicted of criminal offenses, and 1,402 had
pending criminal cases (not shown in table).
Detainees convicted of violent offenses (32.1%) 
and drug offenses (30.1%) constituted the largest 
groups under ICE jurisdiction, followed by 
property offenses (15.5%) and public-order 
offenses (14.1%). 
---------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
Number of prisoners held by military authorities
nearly unchanged during 2004

There were 2,177 prisoners under military 
jurisdiction at yearend 2004. Fifty-nine percent 
of the prisoners held by the Army, Air Force, 
Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard had sentences 
of 1 year or more. At yearend 2004 the Army's 
Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, 
and five other local or regional Army facilities 
held the largest share of inmates under military 
jurisdiction (46%). The 11 Navy facilities held
30% of all inmates; the 6 Marine Corps facilities 
held 19% of all inmates; and the 34 Air Force 
facilities held 5% of all inmates.

The operational capacity of the 56 military
confinement facilities was 3,290 (not shown in 
a table). At yearend 2004 these facilities were 
operating at 66% of their operational capacity. 
About 88% of prisoners held by the Army, Air 
Force, Navy, and Marine Corps were convicted 
inmates; 12% were unconvicted persons.

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The Bureau of Justice Statistics(BJS), with the 
U.S. Census Bureau as its collection agent, 
obtains yearend and midyear counts of prisoners 
from departments of correction in each of the 50 
States and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 

The National Prisoner Statistics(NPS)distinguishes
prisoners in custody from those under jurisdiction. 
To have custody of a prisoner, a State must hold that
person in one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction
means that a State has legal authority over the
prisoner. Prisoners under a State=s jurisdiction 
may be in the custody of a local jail, another State's
prison, or other correctional facility. Some States 
are unable to provide both custody and jurisdiction
counts. 

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in
locally administered confinement facilities who are
under the jurisdiction of local authorities. NPS 
counts include all inmates in State-operated 
facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, 
Rhode Island, and Vermont, which have combined jail-
prison systems.

NPS excludes inmates held by the District of
Columbia (DC), which as of yearend 2001 operated
only a jail system. 

Military Corrections Statistics

BJS obtains yearend counts of prisoners in the
custody of U.S. military authorities from the
Department of Defense Corrections Council. In 1994
the council, comprised of representatives from each
branch of military service, adopted a standardized
report (DD Form 2720) with a common set of items
and definitions. This report gives data on persons
held in U.S. military confinement facilities inside 
and outside the continental United States, by branch 
of service, gender, race, Hispanic origin, conviction
status, sentence length, and offense. It also has data
on the number of facilities, and their design and rated
capacities.

Other inmate counts

In 1995 BJS began collecting yearend  counts of
prisoners from the departments of correction in 
the U.S. Territories (American Samoa, Guam, and 
U.S. Virgin Islands) and U.S. Commonwealths 
(Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico). These 
counts include all inmates for whom the Territory 
or Commonwealth government had legal authority
(inmates under jurisdiction) and all inmates 
physically located in prison or jail facilities 
(inmates in custody). These counts are collected 
by gender, race, Hispanic origin, and sentence 
length. In addition, BJS obtains reports of the 
total design, rated, and operational capacity of 
correctional facilities.

Estimating age-specific incarceration rates

The number of sentenced prisoners within each
group was estimated for men, women, whites, blacks,
and Hispanics. In 2004 estimates were produced
separately for inmates under State jurisdiction by
combining data by gender from NPS and advance
data from the 2003-04 Survey of Inmates in State
Correctional Facilities. 

The Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP)
provided counts of sentenced Federal inmates by 
age for each demographic group at the end of 
fiscal year 2003. The NPS provided counts of 
sentenced Federal inmates by gender at yearend 
2004 and counts by race and Hispanic origin at 
midyear 2004. The FJSP counts were converted to 
percentages and multiplied by the NPS totals at 
yearend 2004.

Estimates of the U.S. resident population for July 1,
2004, by age, gender, race and Hispanic origin were
obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau. Age-specific
rates of incarceration for each demographic group
were calculated by dividing the estimated number of
sentenced prisoners in each age group by the
number of U.S. residents in each age group and then
multiplying by 100,000. Detailed categories exclude
persons identifying with two or more races. Totals by
gender include all inmates and U.S. residents,
regardless of racial identification.
