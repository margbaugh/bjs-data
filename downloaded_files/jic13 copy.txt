Jails in Indian Country, 2013

Todd D. Minton, BJS Statistician


A total of 2,287 inmates were confined in 79 Indian country jails at 
midyear 2013, a 3.3% decrease from the 2,364 inmates confined at midyear 
2012 (figure 1). During the 12-month period between July 2012 and June 
2013, the average number of inmates per operating facility remained 
relatively stable, from 30 jail inmates at midyear 2012 to 29 inmates at 
midyear 2013. The average number of inmates per operating facility has 
increased nearly 11% since 2000, but less than 3% since 2010.

***************************************************
Jails operating in Indian country increased from 
68 facilities in 2004 to 79 in 2013
***************************************************

he Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has conducted the Annual Survey of 
Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) since 1998, although the survey was not 
conducted in 2005 or 2006. The number of known operating jail facilities 
in Indian country increased from 68 in 2004 to 79 in 2012 and 2013. Over 
the 9-year period, 11 facilities permanently closed and 21 facilities 
were newly constructed. Two facilities in 2011 (one adult and one 
juvenile) were treated as one respondent in 2010. Two facilities in 2011 
merged into one facility in 2012. A number of facilities were also 
determined to be out of scope for the survey, including one that was 
included in the 2009 survey, four in the 2010 survey, three in the 2011 
survey, and three in the 2012 survey. For more information on the Survey 
of Jails in Indian Country universe between 1998 and 2003, see the Jails 
in Indian Country series, located on the BJS website.

BJS estimated inmate population counts for seven facilities in 2004, four 
facilities in 2007, and two facilities in 2013 that did not respond to 
the surveys. All known operating facilities responded to the 2008 through 
2012 surveys. (See Methodology for information on jails in Indian 
country, including details on facility counts and participation in the 
surveys.)

HIGHLIGHTS
************

* At midyear 2013, a total of 2,287 inmates were confined in Indian 
country jails—a 3.3% decrease from the 2,364 inmates confined at midyear 
2012.

* The number of inmates admitted into Indian country jails during June 
2013 (10,977) was five times the size of the average daily population 
(2,141).

* Thirteen jails held half of the total inmate population in Indian 
country at midyear 2013.

* For the 79 facilities operating in June 2013, the expected average 
length of stay at admission for inmates was about 6 days.

* Since 2010, about 31% of inmates in Indian country jails have 
been confined for a violent offense, a decline from about 39% 
in each year between midyear 2004 and 2009.

* Domestic violence (15%) and aggravated or simple assault (10%) 
accounted for the largest percentage of violent offenders at midyear 
2013, followed by unspecified violence (5%) and rape or sexual assault 
(2%). 

* Nearly 2 in 10 inmates were held for public intoxication at midyear 
2013.A
***************************************************

**************************************
Percentage of occupied bed space 
on an average day in June decreased 
from 70% to 61%
**************************************

At midyear 2013, the jail facilities in Indian country were rated to hold 
3,482 inmates, up from 3,221 in 2012 (table 1). Based on the 65 
facilities that reported rated capacity in both 2012 and 2013, the amount 
of bed space remained the same in 51 facilities, declined by 35 beds in 3 
facilities, and increased by 290 beds in 11 facilities (not shown). The 
rated capacity in two facilities accounted for nearly 70% (or 200 beds) 
of the increase.

When measured relative to the average daily population (ADP), the 
percentage of rated capacity occupied in Indian country jails declined 
from June 2012 (70%) to June 2013 (61%). This change was the result of a 
decrease in the ADP (down 5%) and an increase in rated capacity (up 8%).

A similar pattern was measured relative to the midyear inmate count 
(2,287). Indian country jails operated at 66% of rated capacity at 
midyear 2013, down from 73% at midyear 2012. From June 2000 to June 2013, 
the overall rated capacity grew at a faster rate (up 68%) than the 
midyear inmate population (up 29%).

****************************************
Thirteen jails held half of all inmates
****************************************

Thirteen jails held half of the total Indian country jail inmate 
population at midyear 2013 (table 2). Combined, the population in the 13 
jails between midyear 2012 and midyear 2013 remained relatively stable. 
However, eight of these facilities experienced a total increase of 103 
inmates in their midyear jail population, and five facilities experienced 
a total decrease of 73 inmates.

Among the 13 facilities holding the majority of inmates, the White 
Mountain Apache Detention Center (up 28 inmates) and Shoshone Bannock 
Tribal Corrections (up 25 inmates) reported the largest increase in 
absolute numbers of jail inmates from midyear 2012 to midyear 2013. Among 
the five facilities reporting a decline in their inmate population, the 
Gila River Department of Rehabilitation and Supervision-Adult reported 
the largest absolute decline (down 25 inmates). Since midyear 2011, this 
facility has experienced a 23% decline (or 35 inmates) in their jail 
inmate population.

Based on the 69 facilities responding to the survey in both 2012 and 
2013, the inmate population decreased by 104 inmates, from 2,149 inmates 
at midyear 2012 to 2,045 in 2013 (not shown). Between midyear 2012 and 
midyear 2013, nearly two-thirds (43) of the 69 jails experienced a 
decrease (39 jails) or no change (4 jails) in the size of their inmate 
population. Twenty-six jails experienced an increase in the size of their 
inmate population over the 12-month period ending midyear 2013.

**************************************
As in previous years, jails holding 50 
or more inmates reported stability in 
their use of jail space in June 2013
**************************************

Of the inmates confined in the 79 Indian country jails at midyear 2013, 
88% (2,010) were held in 52 facilities rated to hold 25 or more inmates 
(table 3). The 27 facilities with a rated capacity of fewer than 25 
inmates accounted for about 34% of all facilities and held 12% of all 
jail inmates in Indian country. The overall jail population ranged from 
no inmates in two facilities to 221 inmates in the Tohono O’odham Adult 
Detention Center, which held nearly 10% of the total population in Indian 
country jails at midyear 2013.

The 18 jails with a rated capacity of 50 or more inmates reported no 
differences in the use of their bed space at midyear 2013 and on an 
average day in June 2013 (figure 2). These jails were operating at about 
two-thirds of their rated capacity during these periods. On their most 
crowded day in June 2013, the 18 largest jails were operating at 77% of 
their rated capacity. The 61 facilities rated to hold fewer than 50 
inmates reported less stability at midyear 2013 (70% of rated capacity), 
on an average day in June 2013 (60%), and on their most crowded day in 
June 2013 (100%).

About 34% (27 facilities) of the 79 facilities in 2013 were operating 
above rated capacity on the most crowded day in June, down from 44% (or 
35 facilities) in 2012 (table 4). Of the 27 facilities in 2013, 16 were 
operating above rated capacity on June 30, 2013, and 14 were operating 
above rated capacity on an average day in June 2013.

**************************************
Sixteen jails were operating at more 
than 150% capacity on their most 
crowded day in June 2013
**************************************

Sixteen jails in Indian country reported operating at more than 150% 
rated capacity on the facility’s most crowded day in June 2013—no change 
from June 2012 (table 5). Eight of these jails were rated to hold 25 or 
more inmates. The Tohono O’odham Adult Detention Center (rated capacity 
of 107) was the largest of these jails and operated at 213% or 121 
inmates over capacity on its peak day in June 2013—similar to 2012.

Among the 16 facilities operating at more than 150% of rated capacity on 
their peak day in June 2013, five were also operating at more than 150% 
capacity at midyear 2013 and three on an average day in June 2013. Three 
facilities—Tohono O’odham Adult Detention Center, White Mountain Apache 
Detention Center, and the Wind River Adult Detention Center—were 
operating at more than 50% over capacity on all three measures (midyear, 
most crowded day, and the average day in June 2013).

**************************************
Admissions declined in about half 
of Indian country jails
**************************************

During 2013, the 79 Indian country jails admitted 10,977 persons—down 
from 12,502 persons admitted to 79 operating facilities in June 2012 
(table 6). The overall decline was observed across all facility size 
categories. In 2013, admissions to facilities rated to hold from 25 to 49 
inmates accounted for about 54% (5,886) of all admissions. The remaining 
jail admissions occurred in facilities rated to hold 50 or more inmates 
(29%), 10 to 24 inmates (16%), and 9 or fewer inmates (less than 1%) in 
June 2013—similar to 2012.

The 69 Indian country jails that provided data in both years reported an 
8% decrease in admissions, from 11,683 admissions in June 2012 to 10,740 
in June 2013 (table 7). Specifically, 36 facilities reported either a 
decline (33) or no change (3) in their admissions, and 33 facilities 
reported an increase in their admissions. The average expected length of 
stay (the time held in custody from admission to release) remained stable 
in June 2012 (5.4 days) and June 2013 (5.5 days).

**************************************
The percentage of inmates held for 
a violent offense declined
**************************************

Since 2000, the distribution of Indian country jail inmates by sex and 
age has changed slightly. Although males represent the largest portion of 
the inmate population in Indian country jails, the percentage of female 
jail inmates has increased between 2000 (20% of all inmates) and 2013 
(24% of all inmates) (table 8). The juvenile population declined from 16% 
in 2000 to 8% at midyear 2013. The distribution of inmates by conviction 
status and offense type experienced some change. After the percentage of 
convicted inmates peaked in 2009 at 69%, it declined at midyear 2010 
(down to 59%), midyear 2011 (down to 57%), and at midyear 2012 and 2013 
(down to 56% in both years)(not shown). 

Since 2010, nearly a third of inmates held in Indian country jails have 
been confined for a violent offense, a decline from about 40% in each 
year between midyear 2004 and 2009. ***For 2002, 2004, and 2007-09 data, 
see Jails in Indian Country, 2012, NCJ 242187, BJS web, June 2013.*** At 
midyear 2013, domestic violence (15%) and aggravated or simple assault 
(10%) accounted for the largest percentage of violent offenders. Inmates 
held for unspecified violence (5%) and rape or sexual assault (2%) 
accounted for about 7% of the jail population. 

Patterns of decline were also observed among inmates held for alcohol- 
and drug-related offenses. Inmates held for driving while intoxicated or 
driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol (DWI or DUI) 
declined from 17% of the total inmate population in 2000 to 8% at midyear 
2013. The percentage of inmates held for a drug law violation declined 
from 8% in 2000 to 4% at midyear 2013.

In 2013, BJS enhanced the SJIC offense category questionnaire item to 
include burglary, larceny-theft, and public intoxication. The enhancement 
allowed for better classification of previously unspecified offenses. As 
a result, 20% of reported offenses at midyear 2013 included public 
intoxication (17%), burglary (2%), and larceny-theft (1%).
 
**************************************
Correctional staff slightly increased
**************************************

The 73 Indian country jails that reported information on staff employed 
1,642 persons at midyear 2013 (table 9). About 67% (1,106) of these 
personnel were jail operations staff, including correctional officers and 
other staff who spent more than 50% of their time supervising inmates. 
Each year since 2010, about 7 in 10 personnel were jail operations staff. 
Overall, the ratio of inmates to jail operations employees was 1.9 
inmates to 1 jail operations employee at midyear 2013—remaining stable 
since 2010.

In 2013, 536 jail personnel in Indian country jails were administrative 
employees; educational staff; technical or professional staff; clerical, 
maintenance, or food service staff; and staff performing other job 
functions. Based on the 67 facilities that reported on staffing in both 
2012 and 2013, the number of jail operations staff increased nearly 2% 
(16 persons) (not shown).

**************************************
Two deaths were reported in Indian 
country jails in the 12-month period 
ending June 30, 2013
**************************************

Indian country jail authorities reported five deaths in custody since 
midyear 2010 (not shown). Two deaths were reported during the 12-month 
period ending June 30, 2013—none were reported as a suicide. During the 
12-month period ending June 30, 2013, 70 facilities reported a total of 
43 attempted suicides. The number of attempted suicides by inmates 
increased from 31 in 2012 to 41 in 2013, based on 62 facilities reporting 
valid data on attempted suicide in both years. Two facilities accounted 
for nearly all of the increase in attempted suicides between 2012 and 
2013. Overall, attempted suicides in Indian country jails declined 
significantly after peaking in 2002. For more information see Jails in 
Indian Country, 2012, NCJ 242187, BJS 
web, June 2013.

**************
Methodology
**************

The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) Annual Survey of Jails in Indian 
Country (SJIC) includes all known Indian country correctional facilities 
operated by tribal authorities or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), 
U.S. Department of the Interior. The survey was conducted in June 2013 
and collected data about the number of inmates and percentage of capacity 
occupied based on the average daily population (ADP), midyear population, 
and peak population in facilities in June 2013 (appendix table 1). The 
midyear count is the number of inmates held on the last weekday in June, 
ADP is the number of inmates confined each day in June divided by 30, and 
the peak population is the number of inmates held on the day in June in 
which the custody population of a facility was the largest.

Through a cooperative agreement with BJS, Westat, Inc. conducted the SJIC 
to describe all adult and juvenile jail facilities and detention centers 
in Indian country. For this report, Indian country includes reservations, 
pueblos, rancherias, and other appropriate areas (18 U.S.C. § 1151). The 
reference date for the survey is June 28, 2013.

Indian country is a statutory term that includes all lands within an 
Indian reservation, dependent Indian communities, and Indian trust 
allotments (18 U.S.C. § 1151). Courts interpret Section 1151 to include 
all lands held in trust for tribes or their members. (See United States 
v. Roberts, 185 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 1999). Tribal authority to imprison 
American Indian offenders had been limited to 1 year per offense by 
statute (25 U.S.C. § 1302), a $5,000 fine, or both. On July 29, 2010, the 
Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 (TLOA) was signed into law, expanding 
tribal court sentencing authority. As a result, offenders may serve 
potentially lengthier sentences (up to 3 years) in Indian country 
correctional facilities (P.L. 111-211, H.R. 725, 124 Stat. 
2258).

Tribal law enforcement agencies act as first responders to both felony 
and misdemeanor crimes. For most of Indian country, the federal 
government provides felony law enforcement concerning crimes by or 
against American Indians and Alaska Natives. Certain areas of Indian 
country are under Public Law 83-280, as amended. Public Law 280 conferred 
jurisdiction over Indian country to certain states and suspended 
enforcement of the Major Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 1153) and the General 
Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 1152) in those areas. Indian tribes retain 
concurrent jurisdiction to enforce laws in Indian country where Public 
Law 280 applies.

Annually, BJS updates its existing roster of jails in Indian country. BJS 
obtains data from administrators of Indian country jails by faxed 
questionnaires and through follow-up phone calls and facsimiles. The 
survey universe and response rates have changed over time. Over the 9-
year period, a number of facilities have closed and new facilities have 
been constructed (table 10). For comparison over time, data on inmate 
population were imputed for the seven facilities in 2004, four facilities 
in 2007, and two facilities in 2013 that did not respond to the surveys. 
Imputations used the most recent available data. The ADP for one facility 
at midyear 2013 was based on its June 30 inmate population. The rated 
capacity for midyear 2013 was imputed for three facilities; one was based 
on 2011 data, and two were based on 2012 data. The imputed value for the 
peak population for two facilities during June 2013 was based on their 
peak population in 2012.

**************************
Expected length of stay
**************************

The stock-flow ratio method was used to measure the expected average 
length of stay for inmates held during June 2013. Data were estimated for 
two facilities that did not respond to the survey, and ADP was estimated 
for one facility.

Stock—average daily population during June 2013 = 2,141

Flow—inmate admissions during June 2013 = 10,977
Stock-flow ratio in June 2013 = 0.195 (2,141/10,977 = 0.195)

Expected length of stay in days (the average number of days held in 
custody from admission to release) = 5.9 days (0.195 x 30 days = 5.9)
