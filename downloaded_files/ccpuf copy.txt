Highlights

* During 2002 large State and local law enforcement agencies, 
representing 5% of agencies and 59% of officers, received a total 
of 26,556 citizen complaints about police use of force. This 
corresponds to an overall rate of 6.6 force complaints per 100 
full-time sworn officers.

* About a third of all force complaints in 2002 were not sustained 
(34%). Twenty-five percent were unfounded, 23% resulted in officers 
being exonerated, and 8% were sustained.

* Complaint volumes, rates, and dispositions varied by agency 
characteristics, such as the size and type of agency, as well as 
policies and procedures related to the handling of complaints.

* About a fifth (19%) of large municipal police departments had a 
civilian complaint review board (CCRB) or agency within their 
jurisdiction. Overall, departments with a CCRB had a higher rate 
of force complaints as compared to those without a CCRB (11.9 
versus 6.6 per 100 officers). 

* Using sustained force complaints as an indicator of excessive 
force results in an estimate of about 2,000 incidents of police use 
of excessive force among large agencies in 2002 C an overall rate of 
1 incident per 200 full-time sworn officers. 
--------------------------------------------------
Large State and local law enforcement agencies -– those with 100
or more sworn officers -- received more than 26,000 citizen 
complaints about officer use of force during 2002. This total 
figure resulted in overall rates of 33 complaints per agency and 
6.6 complaints per 100 full-time sworn officers.

Overall rates were higher among large municipal police departments, 
with 45 complaints per agency, and 9.5 complaints per 100 full-time 
sworn officers. 

Among those complaints having a final disposition at the time of
data collection, about 8% were sustained, meaning there was 
sufficient evidence of the allegation to justify disciplinary 
action against the subject officer(s). 

These findings are from the 2003 Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey, sponsored by the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)and the Office of Community 
Oriented Policing Services (COPS). This report presents data on 
citizen complaints about use of force and complaint dispositions 
in large agencies. Because the majority of force complaints were
received by large municipal police departments, additional detail
is provided on policies and procedures relating to the processing 
of complaints in these departments. 

Background

Section 210402 of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act 
of 1994 requires the Attorney General to "acquire data about the use 
of excessive force by law enforcement officers." Over the past decade, 
BJS has undertaken several projects to address this requirement.

As an initial step, BJS and the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 
held a work-shop on police use of force in May 1995. The purpose of 
the BJS/NIJ workshop was to draw on the expertise of criminal justice
researchers and practitioners while discussing the provisions of 
Section 210402. One result of this workshop was a summary of prior 
research and data collection on police use of force (see National 
Data Collection on Police Use of Force,
www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/ndcopouf.htm.)

BJS subsequently developed the Police Public Contact Survey (PPCS), 
a supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey(NCVS). The
PPCS, conducted in 1999, 2002, and 2005, asked citizens about their
interactions with police officers during the previous 12-months, 
including incidents involving the use of force by officers(see 
Contacts between Police and the Public: Findings from the 2002  
National Survey, www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cpp02.htm.)

As part of continuing efforts to develop data resources on police
use of force, BJS recently expanded its LEMAS survey in order to 
collect data on formal citizen complaints about officer use of 
force. The complaints data were collected from agencies employing 
100 or more full-time sworn officers as of June, 2003. See the 
Methodology section on page 7 for greater detail.

Included in this report are 496 municipal police departments, 32
county police departments, 221 sheriffs' offices, and the 49 primary 
State law enforcement agencies. These 798 agencies comprise about 
5% of all general purpose State and local law enforcement agencies, 
but employ 59% of all full-time sworn officers. Ninety percent of 
these agencies received one or more citizen complaints about police 
use of force during 2002. 

Complaints received

During 2002 a total of 26,556 citizen complaints about police use
of force were received by large law enforcement agencies. This 
corresponds to overall rates of 6.6 per 100 full-time sworn 
officers and 10.9 per 100 full-time sworn officers responding to 
calls for service.

The majority of force complaints (22,238 or 84% of all complaints)
were received by large municipal police departments. Municipal
departments also received the greatest number of force complaints 
on a per officer basis (9.5 per 100) and per officer responding to 
calls for service (15.4 per 100).

Sheriffs' offices received 2,815 force complaints (11% of all
complaints) in 2002, and had rates of 3.4 per 100 full-time sworn 
officers and 7.1 per 100 officers responding to calls for service. 

County police departments received 763 force complaints (about 3%
of all complaints) in 2002, and had corresponding rates of 2.9 
per 100 officers and 4.5 per 100 officers responding to calls for 
service.

The primary State law enforcement agencies received 740 force
complaints in 2002 (about 3% of all complaints), and had the 
lowest rates per officer (1.3 per 100 officers, 1.7 per 100 
officers responding to calls for service).

On a per agency basis, municipal police departments received the
greatest number of force complaints (45 per agency), followed by 
county police departments (24 per agency) and the primary State law
enforcement agencies (15 per agency). Sheriffs' offices received the 
least (13 per agency).

Rates of complaint generally increased with agency size. On a per
agency basis, rates ranged from 7 per agency among those with less 
than 250 full-time sworn, to 214 per agency among those with 1,000 
or more officers. On a per officer basis, rates ranged from 4.2 
per 100 among agencies with less than 250 officers, to 7.7 per 100 
among agencies with 1,000 or more officers.

Rates per officer responding to calls for service ranged from 6.7
per 100 among agencies with less than 250 officers, to 12.4 per 
100 among agencies with 1,000 or more officers. 

Complaint dispositions

Of the total force complaints received during 2002, 94% had a final
disposition at the time of data collection. The percentage with a 
disposition varied only slightly by type of agency.

Among force complaints having a final 
disposition:

* 34% of the complaints were not sustained, meaning there was
insufficient evidence to prove the allegation.

* 25% of the complaints were unfounded, meaning that the complaint
was not based on facts, or the reported incident did not occur.

* 23% of the complaints resulted in officers being exonerated, meaning 
that the incident occurred, but the officer's action was deemed 
lawful and proper.

* 8% of the complaints were sustained, meaning there was sufficient
evidence to justify disciplinary action against the officer(s).

* 9% of the complaints had some other disposition (for example, the
complaint was withdrawn).

The most common disposition for force complaints received by municipal 
police departments was not sustained (37%). A quarter of force complaints
in these agencies were unfounded, and in about a fifth (21%) officers 
were exonerated. Eight percent of force complaints were sustained.

Among county police departments, force complaints most frequently
resulted in officers being exonerated (35%). A quarter were not 
sustained, 17% were unfounded, and 6% were sustained. A larger 
proportion of complaints in these agencies resulted in some other 
disposition (17%), as compared to other types of agencies.

About 6 in 10 complaints received by sheriffs' offices resulted in
officers being exonerated (32%) or the complaint being unfounded (30%). 
A fifth of complaints were not sustained. Compared to other types of
agencies, sheriffs' offices had the highest proportion of complaints 
that were sustained (12%).
--------------------------------------------------------
Complaints about police use of force in England and Wales

How do police in the United States compare to those in other 
countries with regard to citizen complaints about use of force? 
Although comparative international data on police use of force 
and citizen complaints are scarce, one possible comparison is 
with the police in England and Wales. The Research Development 
and Statistics (RDS) Directorate of the British Home Office 
reports annually on police complaints and discipline.

During the 12-month period ending March, 2003, the police in 
England and Wales received a total of 6,154 complaints alleging 
assault by officers. This results in an overall rate of 4.6 
complaints of assault per 100 FTE officers.***Police strength 
based on total FTE's in the 43 police forces at March 31, 2003 
(132,509 FTE's), as published in Police Service Strength, Home 
Office, October 2003. Complaints data represent the total number 
of complaints received, and may include multiple complaints 
arising from individual complaints cases (see Police Complaints 
and Discipline, Home Office, February 2004).*** If other 
"oppressive behavior" is included (oppressive conduct or 
harassment, and unlawful or unnecessary arrest or detention), 
the total number of complaints was 9,584, resulting in an overall 
rate of 7.2 complaints of oppressive behavior per 100 FTE officers. 

To the extent that the LEMAS data on citizen complaints about 
police use of force in the United States are comparable in 
substance to citizen complaints about police assaults and other 
oppressive behavior in England and Wales, the overall rates of 
complaint per 100 officers in both countries are similar (7.5 
force complaints per 100 officers in large U.S. local agencies, 
versus 7.2 oppressive behavior complaints per 100 officers in 
England and Wales).
------------------------------------------------------
The percentage of force complaints having a disposition varied 
slightly by agency size, ranging from 97% among agencies having 
fewer than 250 officers to 93% among those with 1,000 or more 
officers.

Forty-two percent of force complaints received by departments with
1,000 or more officers were not sustained, roughly twice the rate 
of all other departments. Departments with 1,000 or more officers 
also had the lowest sustain rate (6%), roughly half that of all 
other departments.

Municipal police departments

Complaints received

During 2002 a total of 22,238 citizen complaints about police use
of force were received by large municipal police departments.
Rates generally increased by size of department, ranging from 7 
per agency among those with fewer than 250 officers, to 380 per 
agency among those with 1,000 or more officers.

On a per officer basis, rates ranged from 4.7 to 11.3 per 100
officers, and from 7.4 to 19.1 per 100 officers responding to 
calls for service. By population, rates ranged from 0.86 to 3.64 
per 10,000 residents.

Complaint dispositions

Ninety-four percent of force complaints received by municipal
departments during 2002 had a final disposition at the time of 
data collection. The percentage with a disposition ranged from 
97% among those with fewer than 250 officers, to 93% among those 
with 1,000 or more officers.

The overall distribution of complaint dispositions among municipal
police departments was similar to all large State and local agencies.

Civilian Complaint Review Boards

In 2003, 19% of large municipal police departments had a civilian
complaint review board (CCRB) or agency within their jurisdiction 
that was empowered to review use of force complaints against 
officers. About 1 in 4 of these CCRBs had independent investigative 
authority with subpoena powers.

Among all agencies having a CCRB in their jurisdiction, the overall 
rate of citizen force complaints was higher than those not having a 
CCRB (158 per agency versus 18 per agency) as were the rates of 
complaint per 100 officers (11.9 versus 6.6), per 100 officers 
responding to calls for service (19.6 versus 10.6), and per 10,000 
residents (3.70 versus 1.35).

The overall percentage of complaints sustained was lower in jurisdictions
having a CCRB (6% versus 11%). These jurisdictions were also less
likely to find complaints to be unfounded (23% versus 31%) or
exonerate officers (18% versus 26%), and more likely to find complaints 
not sustained (42% versus 25%).
--------------------------------------------------
Limitations of complaints data

Citizen complaints data must be interpreted with caution. 
Differences in how agencies receive, process, and record 
complaints can account for differences in the volume and 
rate of complaints across agencies. Likewise, the citizen's 
decision whether to file a complaint may be influenced by 
both citizen and agency characteristics, and other factors. 

The data presented in this report represent the number of 
officially recorded citizen complaints reported to BJS by large 
State and local law enforcement agencies. Administrative factors, 
including the overall quality of agency records as well as 
specific policies and procedures related to complaint processing, 
may vary across departments. In addition, the categories and 
definitions of complaint dispositions used in LEMAS may not be 
used by all agencies. Some agencies may record multiple 
dispositions, or other unique outcomes.

Force complaints represent a subset of all force events. That is, 
not all force events result in citizens filing formal complaints. 
How often do citizens actually complain? Estimates from the 2002 
Police-Public Contact Survey indicated that although 75% of citizens
experiencing force thought the level of force used was excessive, 
about 10% filed a complaint with the agency employing the officer(s). 
About 1% filed a complaint with a CCRB.

Finally, the meaning of a complaint rate is not entirely clear: a 
low force complaint rate could mean that police are performing well 
or that the complaint process is inaccessible; likewise, a high force
complaint rate could mean that officers use force often or that the 
complaint process is more accessible.

processes, see Police Accountability: The Role of Citizen 
Oversight by Samuel Walker, Wadsworth Publishing, 2001.
-----------------------------------------------
Internal affairs unit

In 2003, 82% of large municipal police departments had an internal
affairs or equivalent special unit staffed with full-time personnel. 
Among all agencies having an internal affairs unit, the overall rate 
of citizen force complaints was higher than those not having a unit 
(54 per agency versus 5 per agency), as were the rates of complaint 
per 100 officers (9.8 versus 3.7), per 100 officers responding to 
calls (16.0 versus 5.5), and per 10,000 residents (2.51 versus 0.68).

Overall, force complaints received by agencies having an internal
affairs unit were more than twice as likely to be found not sustained 
than in agencies not having an internal affairs unit (37% versus 16%).
Force complaints in agencies not having an internal affairs unit were 
more likely to result in officers being exonerated (47% versus 20%). 
The sustain rate was roughly equivalent in both types of agencies.

Personnel monitoring systems

As of 2003, 33% of large municipal police departments had a currently
operational, computer-based personnel performance monitoring and/or 
assessment system (such as an early warning or early intervention 
system) for monitoring or responding to officer behavior patterns 
before they become problematic. Among all agencies having personnel 
monitoring systems, the overall rate of force complaints was higher 
on a per agency basis (69 per agency versus 33 per agency), but 
rates on a per officer and per resident basis were slightly lower.  

External investigation

In 2003, 53% of large municipal police departments had a written
policy requiring that citizen complaints about inappropriate use 
of force receive separate investigation outside the chain of command 
where the accused officer is assigned. Among all agencies having 
such a policy, the overall rate of force complaints was higher (67 
per agency versus 21 per agency), as were rates per 100 officers 
(10.0 versus 8.0), per 100 officers responding to calls (16.3 
versus 13.0), and per 10,000 residents (2.80 versus 1.55).

Administrative appeal

In 2003, 37% of large municipal police departments provided citizens 
the right to administrative appeal in cases involving inappropriate 
use of force. Among all agencies allowing citizen appeal, the overall 
rate of force complaints was lower than those not allowing citizen 
appeal (29 per agency versus 54 per agency). Rates per 100 officers 
(8.8 versus 9.7), per 100 officers responding to calls (14.3 versus 
15.8), and per 10,000 residents (1.96 versus 2.56) were also slightly 
lower among these agencies.

The overall sustain rate for force complaints was more than twice as 
high in agencies where citizens had the right to administrative appeal
(14% versus 6%).
---------------------------------------------
Police use of excessive force

What can this report tell us about excessive force? Discussions 
about police use of force require careful attention to definitions. 
The terms use of excessive force and excessive use of force are 
often used interchangeably when in fact they have different meanings. 
Use of excessive force refers to incidents where police apply too 
much force, while excessive use of force refers to police applying 
force legally in too many incidents (see National Data Collection 
on Police Use of Force, www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/ndcopouf.htm.)

Sustained force complaints from the LEMAS survey can serve as an 
estimate of the incidence of police use of excessive force, with 
limitations noted earlier in this report (see box on page 4). The
International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) has defined 
sustained force complaints as incidents of excessive force (see 
Police Use of Force in America, 2001, IACP). This definition is 
reasonable since a sustained complaint indicates there was 
sufficient evidence of the allegation for the agency to justify 
disciplinary action against the subject officer(s). 

A total of 2,036 citizen complaints received by large agencies in 
2002 were sustained, and may indicate incidents of police use of 
excessive force. On a per officer basis, this results in 1 incident 
per 200 full-time sworn officers overall, and nearly 1 per 100 
officers responding to calls for service.
     
Municipal police departments accounted for 1,625 (or 80%) of the 
total incidents, with slightly higher overall rates on a per 
officer basis (0.7 per 100 full-time sworn officers, and 1.1 per 
100 responding to calls for service).
--------------------------------------------
Collective bargaining

In 2003 about three-quarters (73%) of large municipal police
departments authorized collective bargaining for sworn personnel. 
Collective bargaining agreements often cover disciplinary 
processes and, in some instances, the handling or processing of 
citizen complaints. Among all agencies authorizing collective 
bargaining, the rate of force complaints was higher than those not
authorizing collective bargaining (53 per agency versus 23 per
agency), as were the rates per 100 officers (9.9 versus 7.3), per 
100 officers responding to calls (16.4 versus 11.3), and per 
10,000 residents (2.58 versus 1.60).

Overall, the sustain rate in agencies authorizing collective
bargaining for officers (7%) was about half that in agencies not 
authorizing collective bargaining (15%). Complaints in these 
jurisdictions were more likely to be found not sustained (39% 
versus 24%).

Methodology

The Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) 
survey collects data from a nationally representative sample of 
publicly funded State and local law enforcement agencies in the 
United States. LEMAS surveys have been conducted in 1987,1990,1993, 
1997, 1999 (limited scope), 2000, and 2003.

The 2003 LEMAS survey was the first to collect data on the number
and dispositions of citizen complaints about police use of force. The
items were included on surveys sent to all agencies with 100 or more
full-time sworn officers.

This report presents data from the 2003 LEMAS survey for large 
general purpose State and local law enforcement agencies, defined 
as those employing 100 or more full-time sworn officers, with 40 
or more officers assigned to respond to calls for service. A total 
of 798 agencies met these criteria, including 496 municipal police
departments, 32 county police departments, 221 sheriffs' offices, 
and the 49 primary State law enforcement agencies. For purposes of
this report, a large tribal police department was treated as a
municipal police department.

Some agencies did not report complaints data. Total complaints data 
were imputed for 92 (11.5%) of the 798 large general purpose agencies.
This included 42 (8.5%) municipal police departments, 41 (18.6%)
sheriffs' offices, and 9 (18.4%) of the primary State law enforcement
agencies. By agency size, this included 7 agencies with 1,000 or more 
officers (9.1%),10 agencies with 500-999 officers(13.5%), 19 agencies 
with 250-499 officers (10.7%), and 56 agencies with 100-249 officers 
(11.9%). Overall, 1,369 complaints were imputed, or 5.2% of the total
complaints for large general purpose agencies.

Imputation cells were based on agency type, size, and population served,
following procedures developed by the U.S. Census Bureau for previous 
LEMAS surveys. Ratio imputation based on the number of full-time sworn
officers was used to impute total complaints data. The ratio of 
complaints per officer was calculated in each imputation cell. Within 
cells, the median ratio was multiplied by the number of officers in
non-responding agencies to produce the imputed value. Imputations for
complaint disposition data were based on the median percentage within
imputation cells.

Additional data for large general purpose State and local law enforcement
agencies can be found in the BJS report, Law Enforcement Management 
and Administrative Statistics, 2003: Data for Individual State and
Local Agencies with 100 or More Officers, forthcoming.
