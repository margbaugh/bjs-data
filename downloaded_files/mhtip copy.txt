At midyear 1998 an estimated 283,800 mentally ill 
offenders were incarcerated in the Nation's prisons 
and jails. In recent surveys completed by the Bureau 
of Justice Statistics, 16% of State prison inmates, 7% 
of Federal inmates, and 16% of those in local jails 
reported either a mental condition or an overnight 
stay in a mental hospital.  About 16%, or an estimated 
547,800 probationers, said they had had a mental condi-
tion or stayed overnight in a mental hospital at some 
point in their lifetime.

Based on information from personal interviews, State 
prison inmates with a mental condition were more likely 
than other inmates to be incarcerated for a violent 
offense (53% compared to 46%); more likely than other 
inmates to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs 
at the time of the current offense (59% compared to 51%); 
and more than twice as likely as other inmates to have 
been homeless in the 12 months prior to their arrest 
(20% compared to 9%). Over three-quarters of mentally 
ill inmates had been sentenced to time in prison or 
jail or on probation at least once prior to the current 
sentence.

Over 30% of male mentally ill inmates and 78% of 
females reported prior physical or sexual abuse.  
Since admission 61% of mentally ill inmates in State 
prison and 41% in local jails reported they had 
received treatment for a mental condition in the form of 
counseling, medication, or other mental health services.

Prevalence of mental illness among correctional 
populations based on offender self reports
****************************

The findings in this report are based on the 1997 
Survey of Inmates in State or Federal Correctional 
Facilities, the 1996 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, 
and the 1995 Survey of Adults on Probation.  In each 
survey, offenders selected through nationally 
representative samples were asked a series of mental 
health related questions.  Respondents were asked 
if they have a mental or emotional condition and 
whether they had ever received treatment for a mental 
or emotional problem, other than treatment related to 
drug or alcohol abuse.  (See survey questions in 
the box above.) 

****************************
16% of State prisoners identified 
as mentally ill
****************************

For this report, offenders were identified as mentally 
ill if they met one of the following two criteria: 
they reported a current mental or emotional condition, 
or they reported an overnight stay in a mental hospital 
or treatment program.  An estimated 1 in 10 State prison 
inmates reported a current mental or emotional condition 
(table 1).

******************************************************************************

A slightly larger percentage (11%) of State inmates 
said they had been admitted overnight to a mental 
hospital or treatment program at some point in their 
life.  Overall, nearly a third of all inmates 
reported they had a current mental condition or they 
had received mental health service at some
time.

To take into account underreporting of current mental 
or emotional problems, past admission to a mental 
hospital was included as a measure of mental illness.  
Overall, 16% of State prisoners met these criteria, 
including 10% who reported a current mental condition 
and an additional 6% who said they did not have a 
mental condition but had stayed overnight in a mental 
hospital, unit, or treatment program.
   
Previously estimated rates of mental illness among 
incarcerated populations vary, depending on the 
methodology of the study, the institution, and the 
definition of mental illness.  Estimates range from 
8% to 16% among studies with more rigorous scientific 
methods, including random sampling and a standardized 
assessment or psychological testing. (See the box on 
this page.)
  
Past estimates of the rate of mental illness among 
incarcerated populations are higher than those for 
the U.S. general population.  Among a sample of male 
jail detainees in Cook County (Chicago), Teplin found 
9.5% had experienced a severe mental disorder (schizophrenia, 
mania, or major depression) at some point in their life, 
compared to 4.4% of males in the U.S. general population. 
The Epidemiologic Catchment Area program found that 6.7% 
of prisoners had suffered from schizophrenia at some point, 
compared to 1.4% of the U.S. household population (Robins 
and Regier).

****************************
283,800 mentally ill in prison or jail; 
547,800 on probation
****************************

Using the same criteria described for State prison 
inmates, 16% of offenders in local jails or on probation 
and 7% of inmates in Federal prisons were identified 
as mentally ill in recently completed BJS surveys (table 2).

***************************************************************************************

Probationers were somewhat less likely than inmates in 
State prisons or local jails to report an overnight 
stay in a mental hospital or treatment program but more 
likely to report a mental or emotional problem.  Federal 
inmates had lower rates on both measures.  

Assuming these rates have not changed since the surveys 
were conducted, an estimated 283,800 inmates in prison 
or jail were mentally ill as of June 30, 1998 (table 3).

**************************************************************************

The rate of mental illness among black and Hispanic 
inmates and probationers was much lower.  Among black 
offenders, 14% of those in State prison and local jails, 
and 10% of those on probation were identified as mentally 
ill.  About 11% of Hispanic State prison and local jail 
inmates, and 9% of Hispanic offenders on probation had a 
mental illness. 

Black and Hispanic inmates in Federal prison were half 
as likely as white inmates to report a mental illness.  
About 6% of black inmates and 4% of Hispanic inmates 
reported a mental condition or an overnight stay in a 
mental hospital, compared to 12% of white Federal prison 
inmates.

The prevalence of mental illness also varied by gender, 
with females reporting a higher rate of mental illness 
than males.  Nearly 24% of female State prison and local 
jail inmates, and 22% of female probationers were 
identified as mentally ill, compared to 16% of male 
State prison and jail inmates and 15% of male probationers.

mental illness, compared to 14% of State inmates, 7% of 
Federal inmates, 13% of jail inmates, and 14% of 
probationers age 24 or younger.

The highest rates of mental illness were among white

Approximately  13% of the mentally ill in State prison 
had committed murder; 12%, sexual assault; 13%, robbery; 
and 11%, assault.  Among inmates in Federal prison, 33% 
of the mentally ill were incarcerated for a violent offense, 
compared to 13% of other Federal inmates.  More than 1 in 5
mentally ill Federal prisoners had committed robbery 
(predominantly bank robbery).  Among inmates in local jails, 
30% of the mentally ill had committed a violent offense, 
compared to 26% of other jail inmates.  An estimated 28% 
of mentally ill probationers and 18% of other probationers 
reported their current offense was a violent crime.


Nearly 1 in 5 violent offenders incarcerated 
or on probation were identified as mentally ill.

Mentally ill inmates who were incarcerated for a violent 
offense were more likely to report that the victim of the 
offense was a woman, someone they knew, and under age 18.  
Nearly 61% of mentally ill State prison inmates who had 
committed a violent offense knew their victim.  An estimated 
16% had victimized a relative and 12% an intimate, such as 
a spouse, ex-spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend. 

More than half of the mentally ill reported that they had 
victimized a female during the current offense.  An estimated 
15% reported that their youngest victim was a child, age 12 
or under, and 12% reported the victim to be between ages 13 
and 17.  A weapon was used by 44% of the violent State

Among male inmates 25% of the mentally ill in Federal 
prisons or in jails reported prior physical abuse, 
compared to 5% of other male Federal inmates and 8% 
of other male jail inmates.  Mentally ill male pro-
bationers were 4 times as likely as other probationers 
to report prior physical abuse (21% and 5%, respectively).
     
The rate of physical abuse reported by mentally ill female 
inmates was over twice that reported by males.  Nearly 70% 
of female State prisoners, 50% of female Federal prisoners, 
60% of female jail inmates, and 47% of female probationers 
reported a history of physical abuse.  

Nearly 60% of female mentally ill State prisoners, 45%
of female Federal prisoners, 63% of female jail
inmates and 42% of female probationers reported prior
sexual abuse.

Mentally ill inmates were more likely than others to
be under the influence of alcohol or drugs while
committing their current offense.  About 60% of
mentally ill and 51% of other inmates in State prison
were under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the

inmates, where 65% of the mentally ill and 57% of
other jail inmates were under the influence.  Among
probationers, 49% of the mentally ill and 46% of
others reported alcohol or drug use at the time of the
offense.

Like other inmates and probationers, the mentally ill
were more often under the influence of alcohol than
drugs at the time of the current offense.  About 43%
of mentally ill State prison inmates and 44% of jail
inmates had been drinking when they committed their
current offense.  Thirty-six percent of other inmates
in prison and jail reported they were drinking at the
time of the offense.

*Measured by 3 or more positive CAGE responses.  For description of the CAGE 
diagnostic measure see text.

***********************************************************************************************************************************
CAGE is an acronym for four questions used by the
diagnostic instrument to assess alcohol dependence or
abuse.  Respondents are asked if they have ever
attempted to (C)ut back on drinking; ever felt
(A)nnoyance at others' criticism of their drinking;
ever experienced feelings of (G)uilt about drinking;
and ever needed a drink first thing in the morning as
an (E)ye opener or to steady their nerves.  A person's
likelihood of alcohol abuse is assessed by the number
of positive responses to these four questions. 
Clinical tests involving hospital admissions, found
three or more positive CAGE responses carried a .99
predictive value for alcohol abuse or dependence. (See
Substance Abuse and Treatment, State and Federal
Prisoners, 1997, BJS Special Report, NCJ 172871, for
additional information on the CAGE instrument.)  

Mentally ill inmates and probationers were more
commonly alcohol dependent, reporting three or more
positive CAGE responses.  About 38% of mentally ill
jail inmates reported signs of alcohol dependence,
while 24% of other jail inmates reported signs of
dependence.  Among State prison inmates, 34% of the
mentally ill and 22% of other inmates reported three
or more positive responses.

****************************
Mentally ill offenders report negative life
experiences related to drinking
****************************

In response to questions concerning their life
experiences with alcohol, about 17% of mentally ill
and 9% of other inmates in State prison said they had
lost a job due to drinking.  Among jail inmates with a
mental condition, 18% had lost a job due to drinking,
while 10% of other jail inmates reported losing a job. 
Nearly 20% of mentally ill probationers had lost a
job; 5% of other probationers.

Amid other alcohol-related problems reported by the
mentally ill, 35% of State prisoners had been arrested
or held at a police station due to drinking, and 46%
had gotten into a fight while drinking.  Forty-nine
percent of mentally ill State prison inmates, 44% of
Federal inmates, 53% of jail inmates, and 46% of
mentally ill probationers said they had consumed as
much as a fifth of liquor (about 20 drinks) in 1 day. 

Mentally ill jail inmates more often reported a prior
stay in a detoxification unit for alcohol or drugs. 
An estimated 22% of the mentally ill in jail and 11% 
of other inmates reported they had been put in a
detoxification unit. 

****************************
Mentally ill expected to serve 15 months longer than
other inmates in prison

Overall, mentally ill State prison inmates were
sentenced to serve an average of 171 months in prison,

Note: Because data on sentence length and time served are restricted to persons in prison and jail,
they overstate the average sentence and time to be served by those entering prison or jail. 
Persons with shorter sentences leave prison and jail more quickly, resulting in a longer average 
sentence among persons in the inmate samples.

b/Based on time served when interviewed plus time to be served until the expected date of release.
********************************************************************************************************* 

On average, violent offenders with a mental illness 
were sentenced to 230 months (5 months longer than 
other violent inmates) and property offenders 128 
months (10 months longer than other inmates).    
Mentally ill jail inmates typically had sentences
shorter than other jail inmates.  On average, mentally
ill inmates had a maximum sentence of 20 months, while
other inmates an average of 26 months.  Violent, drug,
and property offenders identified as mentally ill had
average sentences that were 6 to 12 months shorter
than other offenders.

On average, mentally ill inmates in State prison are
expected to serve more time in prison than other
inmates.  From the time of admission to prison to the
time of the survey, mentally ill offenders had served
on average 5 months longer than other offenders in
State prison.  Based on the time of admission to the
time of expected release, mentally ill offenders
expected to serve a total of 103 months in prison, 15
months longer than other offenders.  The largest
differences in time served were among violent and
property offenders.  The mentally ill expected 
to serve an average of at least 12 additional months
for violent and property offenses.   

Unlike State prisoners, mentally ill inmates in local
jails expected to serve less time than inmates who are
not mentally ill.  Overall, both mentally ill jail
inmates and other inmates had served about 6 1/2 months
from the time of admission to the time of the survey. 
On average, mentally ill inmates expected to serve a
total of 9 months in jail prior to release; other inmates 
expected to serve about 11 months.  

****************************
Disciplinary problems common among mentally ill inmates 
****************************

Mentally ill inmates in State or Federal prison, as
well as those in jail, were more likely than others in
those facilities to have been involved in a fight, or
hit or punched since admission.  Among State prisoners
36% of mentally ill inmates reported involvement in a
fight, compared to 25% of other inmates (table 13).

Mentally ill inmates in Federal prison were over twice
as likely as others to report involvement in a fight
(21% compared to 9%).  

Twenty-four percent of mentally ill State prison
inmates had been involved in two or more fights since
admission, and 12% reported involvement in four or
more fights.  Among jail inmates 10% of the mentally ill 
had been involved in two or more fights, compared 6% of 
those not mentally ill.

Consistent with their more frequent involvement in
fights, disciplinary problems were more common among
mentally ill inmates than other inmates.  More than 6
in 10 mentally ill State prison inmates had been
formally charged with breaking prison rules since
admission.  About half of other inmates reported they
had been charged with breaking the rules.  Among
Federal prison inmates 41% of the mentally ill had been 
charged with a rule violation, compared to 33% of inmates 
not identified as mentally ill.

Among jail inmates, 41% of those identified as
mentally ill had received some form of mental health
services since admission.  The majority of those
receiving treatment (34%) had been given medication. 
Fewer jail inmates (16%) than State prisoners (44%)
said they had received counseling or therapy since
admission.  

Just over half of mentally ill probationers had
received treatment since their sentence to community
supervision.  Counseling was the most common 
form of treatment (44%), followed by medication (37%), 
and an overnight stay in a mental hospital or treatment 
program (12%).

When sentenced to probation, an offender may be
required by the court or probation agency to meet
various conditions of the sentence, such as
maintaining employment, submitting to drug testing, or
participating in treatment.  An estimated 13% of
probationers were required to seek mental health
treatment as a condition of their sentence. 
Forty-three percent of those required to participate
in treatment had done so by the time of the survey.

while 60% of males in State prison, 57% in Federal
prison, and 38% in local jails reported treatment.

White mentally ill inmates reported higher rates of

Overall, 17% of inmates in State prison, 10% in
Federal prison, 11% in local jails, and 12% of those
on probation had received some form of mental health
services since their current admission to prison or
jail or sentence to probation.  The most common form
of treatment in local jails was medication, reported
by 9% of inmates.  Probationers were more likely to
have received counseling (10%) than to have taken
medication (6%) while under supervision.  Among State
prison inmates 12% said they received medication while
incarcerated, and 12% participated in counseling or
therapy.

Methodology
****************************

Data in this report are based on personal interviews
conducted through  three BJS surveys, the 1997 Survey
of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional
Facilities, the 1996 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails,
and the 1995 Survey of Adults on Probation.
Detailed descriptions of the methodology and sample
design of each survey can be found in the following: 
Substance Abuse and Treatment of Adults on Probation,
1995 (NCJ 166611); Profile of Jail Inmates, 1996 (NCJ
164629); and Substance Abuse and Treatment of State
and Federal Prisoners, 1997 (NCJ 172871).

****************************
Accuracy of the estimates
****************************

The accuracy of the estimates presented in this report
depends on two types of error:  sampling and
nonsampling.  Sampling error is the variation that may
occur by chance because a sample rather than a
complete numeration of the population was conducted. 
Nonsampling error can be attributed to many sources,
such as nonreponses, differences in the interpretation
of questions among inmates, recall difficulties, and
processing errors.  In any survey the full extent of
the nonsampling error is never known.  The sampling
error, as measured by an estimated standard error,
varies by the size of the estimate and the size of the
base population.  Estimates of the standard errors for
selected characteristics have been calculated for each
survey (see appendix tables).  These standard errors
may be used to construct confidence intervals around
percentages.  For example, the 95% confidence interval
around the percentage of State prison inmates who were
identified as mentally ill is approximately 16.2% plus
or minus 1.96 times 0.40% (or 15.4% to 16.9%). 

These standard errors may also be used to test the
statistical significance of the difference between two
sample statistics by pooling the standard errors of
the two sample estimates.  For example, the standard
error of the difference between mentally ill State
prisoners and other inmates who were incarcerated for
a violent offense would be 1.49% (or the square root
of the sum of the squared standard errors for each
group).  The difference would be 1.96 times 1.49 (or
2.91%).  Since the difference of 6.8% (52.9% minus
46.1%) is greater than 2.91%, the difference would be
considered statistically significant.

****************************
Estimating the number of mentally 
ill offenders under correctional 
supervision
****************************

Estimates of the total number of persons in prison,
jail and on probation with a mental illness were
obtained by multiplying the ratio of inmates or
probationers identified as mentally ill from the
personal interviews conducted in the three BJS surveys
referenced above, by the total number of inmates in
State prison, Federal prison, and local jails and the
total number of offenders on probation.

For example, the total number of State prison inmates
with a mental illness was estimated by multiplying the
ratio of mentally ill offenders in State prison
(16.2%) obtained from the 1997 Survey of Inmates in
State Correctional Facilities, by the total State
prison custody population at midyear 1998 (1,102,653)
from the National Prisoner Statistics data collection.
