Carjacking, a type of robbery, is theft or attempted theft of
a motor vehicle by force or threat of force.  Between 1987 and
1992, carjackings accounted for 2% of the 1.9 million vehicle
thefts per year that occurred nationwide.  This report
analyzes data from the National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS) to describe this crime.

*An average of 35,000 completed and attempted carjackings took
place each year in the United States between 1987 and 1992. 
In 52% of the carjackings the offender succeeded in stealing
the victim's motor vehicle. 

*Each year on average between 1987 and 1992, .2 per 1,000
Americans age 12 or older (or 2 per 10,000) were victims of a
completed or attempted carjacking.

*Men were more likely than women (.3 per 1,000 compared to .1
per 1,000) and blacks were more likely than whites (.4 and .2
respectively) to be victimized by carjacking.  Persons age 35
or older were less likely than younger people to become
carjacking victims.

Carjackings, 1987-92-92:  Aggregate annual average

Total                35,500
    Completed        18,600
    Attempted        16,900

*Nine in ten completed carjackings were reported to the
police, compared to 6 in 10 attempts.

*Most carjacking victims escaped without injury.  Victims were
injured in 24% of the completed carjackings and 18% of
attempted carjackings.  Four percent of all victims of
attempted or completed carjackings suffered a serious
injury--gunshot or knife wounds, broken bones, loss of teeth,
internal injuries, loss of consciousness, or undetermined
injuries requiring 2 or more days of hospitalization.  

*Offenders used a weapon in 77% of all attempted and completed
carjackings.  The offender was armed in 82% of completed
carjackings and 71% of all attempted carjackings.  Handguns
were the most common weapon used in the completed offenses,
but not in the attempts.  Offenders were armed with handguns
in 59% of completed carjackings and in 17% of attempted
carjackings.

*Carjackings were more likely to occur in the evening or at
night.  About two-thirds of all carjackings occurred after
dark.  Fifty-eight percent of carjackings that occurred at
night and 45% of those during the day were completed.   

*Most carjackings occurred away from the victim's home.
Twenty-nine percent took place in a parking lot or garage, and
45% occurred in an open area, such as on the street.  Eighteen
percent occurred at or near the victim's home.

*Offenders between ages 21 and 29 committed about half of all
completed carjackings.  An additional 12% were committed by
offenders 18-20 years of age.  

*Victims identified the offenders' race as white in 32% of all
carjackings, black in 49%, and Asian or American Indian in 6%.

Multiple offenders of more than one race committed 5% of all
carjackings.  In 8% of all carjackings the victim was unable
to identify the offender's race.  

*Men committed 87% of all carjackings.  Six percent were
committed by males and females together.  Only 1% of all
carjackings were committed by women alone.  In 6%, the victim
could not identify the offenders' sex.

*The median value of automobiles stolen in carjackings was
$4,000.  Forty-six percent were valued at over $5,000; 13%, at
$2,500-$4,999; and 41%, at $2,499 or less.

*About half (54%) of all completed or attempted carjackings
were committed by groups of two or more offenders.  Forty-one
percent were committed by lone offenders.  In 5% of all
carjackings, the number of offenders was not known.  The
number of offenders did not appear to affect the probability
that the crime would be completed.  About half of both
lone-offender and multiple-offender carjackings were
completed.

*The risks of carjacking were different in different types of
residential areas, similar to the risks of robbery and motor
vehicle theft.  Suburbanites were less likely than residents
of a central city and more likely than rural residents to be
victims of a completed or attempted carjacking:

           Carjackings per 1,000
  Area     residents age 12 or older

Urban                .31
Suburban             .17
Rural                .03

*Completed and attempted carjackings accounted for 3% of all
robberies.  Carjackings involving property loss of at least
$1,000 represented 22% of robberies with losses of $1,000 or
more.

The National Crime Victimization Survey, from which the data
for this data brief were drawn, has not previously been used
to create an estimate of carjacking.  This data brief does not
provide individual year estimates of carjacking because many
of the annual estimates fell below the statistical threshold
for reliability maintained for the survey.  By aggregating
data for a number of years, and producing average annual
estimates, more reliable estimates of this relatively rare
crime are possible.  For more information about the NCVS
methodology, see Criminal Victimization in the United States,
1991, December 1992, NCJ-139563.
