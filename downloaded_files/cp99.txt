-------------------------------------------------------------------

Twenty States executed 98 prisoners during 1999.  The number executed 
was 30 greater than in 1998 and was the largest annual number since the 
105 executed in 1951.  The prisoners executed during 1999 had been under
sentence of death an average of 11 years and 11 months, 13 months more 
than that for inmates executed in 1998.

At yearend 1999, 3,527 prisoners were under sentence of death.  
California held the largest number on death row  (553), followed 
by Texas (460), Florida (365), and Pennsylvania (230).  Twenty were 
under a Federal death sentence.

During 1999, 32 States and the Federal prison system received 272 
prisoners under sentence of death.  Texas (48 admissions), California 
(43), North Carolina (24) and Florida (20) accounted for half of those
sentenced to death in 1999.

During 1999, 98 men were executed:  61 whites, 33 blacks, 2 American 
Indians, and 2 Asians.  The executed inmates included 9 Hispanics 
(8 white and 1 American Indian). Ninety-four of the executions were 
carried out by lethal injection; 3, by electrocution; and 1, by lethal 
gas.

From January 1, 1977, to December 31, 1999, 598 executions took place 
in 30 States.  Sixty-four percent of the executions occurred in 5 States: 
Texas (199), Virginia (73), Florida (44), Missouri (41), and Louisiana 
(25).

Capital punishment laws

At yearend 1999 the death penalty was authorized by 38 States and the 
Federal Government.  During 1999 no State enacted new legislation 
authorizing capital punishment.

Statutory changes

During 1999, 9 States revised statutory provisions relating to the 
death penalty.  Most of the changes involved additional aggravating
circumstances and procedural amendments.

By State, the changes were as follows:

Alabama -- Added to the criminal code as aggravating circumstances murder 
of two or more persons in the course of one "scheme" and murder that was 
one of a series of intentional killings committed by the defendant (Ala. 
Code 13A-5-49(9),(10)), effective 9/1/99.

Colorado -- Added as an aggravating factor any Class 1 felony committed 
"because of the victim's race, color, ancestry, religion, or national 
origin" (CRS 16-11-103(5)(n)), effective 7/1/99.

Kansas -- Revised the code of criminal procedure.  Changes became 
effective 7/1/99.

Kansas added language to keep confidential the identity of persons 
carrying out the execution and providing for certification that 
substances used in the execution will "result in death in a swift 
and humane manner"  (K.S.A. 22-4001).

Kansas legislators revised the statute designating witnesses to the 
execution: witnesses must be at least 18 years old; the Secretary of
Corrections may select 10 witnesses, including family members of the 
victim; the identity of a witness cannot be divulged by anyone other 
than the witness himself; any  witness may be barred from attending for
security reasons (K.S.A. 22-4003).

Kansas also amended its procedural code for issuance of orders by 
the courts regarding implementation of the execution (K.S.A. 22-4006, 
22-4009, and 22-4011 through 22-4014).

Nevada -- Added to both the definition of first degree murder and the 
list of aggravating factors murder committed on school property or in 
any venue related to a school-sponsored activity when the perpetrator
"intended to cause death or substantial bodily harm to more than one 
person by means of a weapon, device or course of action that would 
normally be hazardous to the lives of more than one person" 
(NRS 200.030(1)(d) and NRS 200.033(14)).  These changes became 
effective 10/1/99.

New Jersey -- Amended an aggravating factor, felony murder, to include 
any murder where the victim had a domestic violence restraining order 
filed against the defendant (NJSA 2C:11-3(c)(4)(g)), effective 9/17/99.

Oregon -- Amended its procedural code.  The changes became effective 
10/23/99.

Oregon revised the procedures for issuing and carrying out a death 
warrant. The revisions established guidelines for a death warrant 
hearing, which will include a review of the offender's mental 
competency (ORS 137.463).

Another procedural amendment set forth circumstances under which a 
person other than the defendant may file for post-conviction relief 
on behalf of the defendant (ORS 138.510).

Oregon amended its procedural guidelines pertaining to appointment of 
counsel for indigent defendants and a defendant's right to waive counsel 
(ORS 183.590). The amendment also added a provision insulating licensed 
health care professionals from disciplinary action stemming from their 
participation in an execution.

Lawmakers added a provision requiring that any documents filed on 
behalf of the defendant are to be served personally to the defendant 
by providing a copy to the defendant's current custodian.   
(ORS 144.126).

Pennsylvania -- Revised provisions of the capital statute to clarify 
the exact time period in which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court is 
required to provide the Governor with a complete record of court 
proceedings and its opinion and order in death penalty cases  
(42 Pa.C.S. Sec. 9711(i)), effective 12/12/99.

Texas -- Amended the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure to allow during 
the sentencing phase of a capital trial, upon written request of the
defendant's attorney, a court instruction to the jury that any person 
not sentenced to death will be sentenced to life imprisonment and will 
not be eligible for parole until the actual time served by the offender 
equals 40 years (TCCP Art. 37.071 Subsection 2(e)(2)), effective 9/1/99.

Wyoming -- Amended an aggravating factor to include among capital 
felonies murder in the commission of abuse of a child under 16 
years of age (W.S. Sec. 6-2-102(h)(xii)), effective 7/1/99.

Automatic review

Of the 38 States with capital punishment statutes at yearend 1999, 
36 provided for review of all death sentences regardless of the 
defendant's wishes.  The Federal death penalty procedures did not 
provide for automatic review after a sentence of death had been 
imposed.

In Arkansas, case law held that the supreme court review the trial 
court record for error in capital cases (State v. Robbins, 339 Ark. 
379, 5 S.W.3d 51 (1999)).  Such review is independent of a 
defendant's right to waive appeals.

In South Carolina the defendant had the right to waive sentence 
review if the defendant was deemed competent by the court (State v. 
Torrence, 473 S.E.2d. 703 (S.C. 1996)).  In Mississippi the question 
of whether a defendant could waive the right to automatic review of 
the sentence had not been addressed. In Wyoming neither statute nor 
case law clearly precluded a waiver of appeal. 

While most of the 36 States authorized an automatic review of both 
the conviction and sentence, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and 
Tennessee required review of the sentence only.  In Idaho review of 
the conviction had to be filed through appeal or forfeited.  In 
Indiana and Kentucky, a defendant could waive review of the conviction.

The review is usually conducted by the State's highest appellate court
regardless of the defendant's wishes.  If either the conviction or the
sentence was vacated, the case could be remanded to the trial court for
additional proceedings or for retrial.  As a result of retrial or
resentencing, a death sentence could be reimposed.

Method of execution 

As of December 31, 1999, lethal injection was the predominant method 
of execution (34 States). 

Eleven States authorized electrocution; 4 States, lethal gas; 3 States,
hanging; and 3 States, a firing squad.

Sixteen States authorized more than 1 method -- lethal injection and an 
alternative method -- generally at the election of the condemned prisoner; 
however, 5 of these 16 stipulated which method must be used, depending 
on the date of sentencing; 1 authorized hanging only if lethal injection 
could not be given; and if lethal injection is ever ruled unconstitutional, 
1 authorized lethal gas, and 1 authorized electrocution. 

The Federal Government authorizes the method of execution under two 
different laws.  Offenses prosecuted under 28 CFR, Part 26, mandate 
lethal injection, while those prosecuted under the Violent Crime Control 
act of 1994 (18 U.S.C. 3596) call for the method of  the State in which 
the conviction took place.

Minimum age  

In 1999 seven jurisdictions did not specify a minimum age for which 
the death penalty could be imposed. 

In some States the minimum age was set forth in the statutory provisions 
that determine the age at which a juvenile may be transferred to criminal
court for trial as an adult.  Fourteen States and the Federal system 
required a minimum age of 18.  Seventeen States indicated an age of
eligibility between 14 and 17.

under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act
of 1994, the method is that of the State in which the
conviction took place, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3596.

Characteristics of prisoners under 
sentence of death at yearend 1999

Thirty-seven States and the Federal prison system held a total of 
3,527 prisoners under sentence of death on December 31, 1999, an 
increase of 62, or 1.8% more than at the end of 1998.

The Federal prison system count rose from 19 at yearend 1998 to 20 
at yearend 1999.  Three States reported 39% of the Nation's death row
population: 

California (553), Texas (460),  and Florida (365).  Of the 39 
jurisdictions with statutes authorizing the death penalty during 1999, 
New Hampshire had no one under a capital sentence, and Kansas, South 
Dakota, Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming had 4 or fewer. 

Among the 38 jurisdictions with prisoners under sentence of death at 
yearend 1999, 19 had more inmates than a year earlier, 11 had fewer 
inmates, and 8 had the same number.  California had an increase of 41,
followed by North Carolina (15).  Florida had the largest decrease 
(10).

During 1999 the number of black inmates under sentence of death rose 
by 25; the number of whites increased by 31; and the number of persons 
of other races rose from 59 to 65.

The number of Hispanics sentenced to death rose from 315 to 325 during 
1999.  Thirty-three Hispanics were received under sentence of death, 14 
were removed from death row, and 9 were executed.  Three-quarters 
of the Hispanics were held in 3 States:  California (107), Texas 
(100), and Florida (34).

During 1999 the number of women sentenced to be executed increased 
from 49 to 50.  Three women were  received under sentence of death 
and two were removed from death row. 

Women were under sentence of death in 18 States.  More than half of 
all women on death row at yearend were in California, Texas, Florida, 
and North Carolina.

*Total includes other races.
 
Men were 99% (3,477) of all prisoners under sentence of death.   Whites 
comprised 55%; blacks comprised 43%; and other races (1.8%) included 
28 American Indians, 24 Asians, and 13 persons of unknown race.  Among 
those for whom ethnicity was known, 10% were Hispanic.

The gender, race, and Hispanic origin of those under sentence of death at 
yearend 1999 were as follows:

             Persons under sentence

Among inmates under sentence of death on December 31, 1999, for whom 
information on education was available, three-fourths had either 
completed high school (38%) or finished 9th, 10th, or 11th grade (38%).  
The percentage who had not gone beyond eighth grade (14%) was larger 
than that of inmates who had attended some college (10%).  The median 
level of education was the 11th grade. 
 
Of inmates under a capital sentence and with reported marital status, 
more than half had never married; more than a fifth were married at 
the time of sentencing; and a fifth were divorced, separated, or widowed.

Among all inmates under sentence of death for whom date of arrest 
information was available, about half were age 20 to 29 at the time 
of arrest for their capital offense; 13% were age 19 or younger; and 
less than 1% were age 55 or older.  

The average age at time of arrest was 28 years.  On December 31, 
1999, 37% of all inmates were age 30 to 39, and 69% were age 25 to 
44. The youngest offender under sentence of death was age 18; the 
oldest was 84.

Entries and removals of persons 
under sentence of death 

Between January 1 and December 31, 1999, 32 State prison systems reported
receiving 271 prisoners under sentence of death; the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons received 1 inmate.  Half of the inmates were received in 4 States:
Texas (48), California (43), North Carolina (24), and Florida (20).

All 272 prisoners who had been received under sentence of death had been
convicted of murder.  By gender and race, 155 were white men, 103 were 
black men, 4 were American Indian men, 6 were Asian men, 1 was a
self-identified Hispanic male, 2 were white women, and 1 was a black 
woman.  Of the 272 new admissions, 33 were Hispanic men.

Twenty-one States reported a total of 88 persons whose sentence of death 
was overturned or removed.  Appeals courts vacated 48 sentences while
upholding the convictions and vacated 31 sentences while overturning the
convictions.  Florida (22 exits) had the largest number of vacated capital
sentences.  Illinois reported two commutations of death sentences; Alabama,
Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, and Virginia each reported 
one.  Illinois removed one inmate when the Governor granted him a pardon.

As of December 31, 1999, 58 of the 88 persons who were formerly under 
sentence of death were serving a reduced sentence, 17 were awaiting a new 
trial, 9 were awaiting resentencing, 1 was found not guilty upon retrial, 
2 had all capital charges dropped, and 1 had no action taken after 
being removed from under sentence of death. 

In addition, 24 persons died while under sentence of death in 1999.  
Nineteen of these deaths were from natural causes -- 5 in Florida, 4 in
Tennessee, 3 in Texas, 2 in Pennsylvania, and 1 each in Ohio, Alabama,
Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona.  Two suicides occurred -- 1 each 
in Alabama and Florida.  Two inmates were killed by other inmates -- 1 
each in New Jersey and Mississippi.  One inmate in Florida died from 
injuries received during an altercation with a correctional officer.

From 1977, the year after the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality 
of revised State capital punishment laws, to 1999, a total of 5,985 
persons entered prison under sentence of death.  During these 23 years, 
598 persons were executed, and 2,240 were removed from under a death 
sentence by appellate court decisions and reviews, commutations, or 
death.***Footnote 1: An individual may have been received and removed
from under sentence of death more than once.  Data are based on the
most recent sentence.***

Among individuals who received a death sentence between 1977 and 1999, 
2,956 (49%) were white, 2,453 (41%) were black, 483 (8%) were Hispanic, 
and 93 (2%) were of other races.  The distribution by race and Hispanic 
origin of the 2,240 inmates who were removed from death row between 1977 
and 1999 was as follows:  1,156 whites (52%), 922 blacks (41%), 130 
Hispanics (6%), and 32 persons of other races (1%).  Of the 598 who 
were executed, 334 (56%) were white, 211 (35%) were black, 43 (7%) 
were Hispanic, and 10 (2%) were of other races.

Criminal history of inmates 
under sentence of death in 1999

Among inmates under a death sentence on December 31, 1999, for whom 
criminal history information was available, 64% had past felony
convictions, including 8% with at least one previous homicide 
conviction. 

Among those for whom legal status at the time of the capital offense was
reported, 40% had an active criminal justice status.  Less than half of 
these were on parole, and a quarter were on probation.  The others had 
charges pending, were incarcerated, had escaped from incarceration, or 
had some other criminal justice status.  

Criminal history patterns differed by race and Hispanic origin.  More 
blacks (68%) than whites (62%) or Hispanics (58%) had a prior felony
conviction. 

About the same percentage of blacks (9%), whites (8%), and Hispanics 
(7%) had a prior homicide conviction.  A slightly higher percentage of
Hispanics (24%) or blacks (19%) than whites (16%) were on parole when 
arrested for their capital offense.

Since 1988, data have been collected on the number of death sentences 
imposed on entering inmates.  Among the 3,448 individuals received 
under sentence of death during that time, about 1 in every 7 entered 
with 2 or more death sentences.

During this 23-year period, 6 States executed 406 prisoners:  Texas 
(199), Virginia (73), Florida (44), Missouri (41), Louisiana (25), and 
South Carolina (24).  These States accounted for two-thirds of all 
executions. Between 1977 and 1999, 331 white non-Hispanic men, 211 black
non-Hispanic men, 43 Hispanic men, 5 American Indian men, 5 Asian men, 
and 3 white non-Hispanic women were executed.

During 1999 Texas carried out 35 executions; Virginia executed 14 persons;
Missouri, 9; Arizona, 7; Oklahoma, 6; Arkansas, North Carolina, and South 
Carolina, 4 each; Alabama, California, and Delaware, 2 each; and Florida,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, 
and Washington, 1 each.  The inmate executed in Ohio was the first executed 
in that State since 1963. All persons executed in 1999 were male.  Fifty-
three were white; 33 were black; 9 were Hispanic; 1 was American Indian; 
and 2 were Asian.

From 1977 to 1999, 6,365 prisoners were under death sentences for varying 
lengths of time.   The 598 executions accounted for 9% of those at risk.  A
total of 2,240 prisoners (35% of those at risk) received other dispositions. 
About the same percentage of whites (11%), blacks (8%), and Hispanics (9%)
were executed.  Somewhat larger percentages of whites (37%) and blacks (35%)
than Hispanics (26%) were removed from under a death sentence by means other
than execution.

Among prisoners executed from 1977 to 1999, the average time spent between 
the imposition of the most recent sentence received and execution was nearly
10 years.  White prisoners had spent an average of 91/2 years, and black
prisoners, 101/2  years.  The 98 prisoners executed in 1999 were under
sentence of death an average of 11 years and 11 months.

For the 598 prisoners executed between 1977 and 1999, the most common 
method of execution was lethal injection (438).  Other methods  were 
electrocution (144), lethal gas (11), hanging (3), and firing squad (2).

The median time between the imposition of a death sentence and yearend 
1999 was 78 months.  Overall, the average time for women was 6.6 years, 
slightly less than that for men (7.7 years).  On average, whites, blacks, 
and Hispanics had spent from 80 to 95 months under a sentence of death. 

---------------------------
Advance count of executions:  
January 1, 2000 - December 1, 2000
 
To provide the latest data on
capital punishment, BJS initiated
an ongoing collection effort in 1997
that gathers information following each
execution.  The data include the date
of execution, the jurisdiction, the method
used, and the name, race, and gender
of each person executed.
 
Between January 1 and December
1, 14 States had executed 79
prisoners, a 19% decrease from
the 98 executed in 1999.
 
Texas had carried out 37, 47% of
the executions in 2000.  This matches
the number of executions in Texas
in 1997 and represents the most executions
in a single state in any year since the
Federal Government began tracking
executions on an annual basis.
Tennessee carried out its first execution
since 1960.
 
Lethal injection accounted for 74
of the executions, and 5 were
carried out by electrocution.
 
Forty-four of those executed were
white, 34 black, and 1 American
Indian.  Two women were executed
(1 each in Texas and Arkansas).
 
Final counts for all of 2000 will
appear in Capital Punishment 2000,
a BJS Bulletin, released in late 2001.
This annual report will comprise data
collected from State and Federal
departments of correction.  The
report  will cover all persons under
sentence of death on December 31,
2000, as well as those received from
court and removed from under
sentence of death.

Methodology 

Capital punishment information is collected annually as 
part of the National Prisoner Statistics program (NPS-8).  
This data series is collected in two parts:  data on persons 
under sentence of death are obtained from the department of 
correction in each jurisdiction currently authorizing capital 
punishment and are updated annually; information on the status 
of death penalty statutes is obtained from the Office of the 
Attorney General in each of the 50 States, the District of 
Columbia, and the Federal Government.  Data collection forms 
and more detailed tables are available in Correctional Populations 
in the United States, published annually.  NPS-8 covers all persons 
under sentence of death at any time during the year who were held 
in a State or Federal nonmilitary correctional facility.  Included 
are capital offenders transferred from prison to mental hospitals 
and those who may have escaped from custody. Excluded are persons 
whose death sentences have been overturned by the court, regardless 
of their current incarceration status.

The statistics reported in this Bulletin may differ from data 
collected by other organizations for a variety of reasons:  (1) 
NPS-8 adds inmates to the number under sentence of death not at 
sentencing but at the time they are admitted to a State or Federal 
correctional facility.  (2) If in one year inmates entered prison 
under a death sentence or were reported as being relieved of a 
death sentence but the court had acted in the previous year, the 
counts are adjusted to reflect the dates of court decisions.  (See 
the note on table 5 for the affected jurisdictions.)  (3) NPS counts 
are always for the last day of the calendar year and will differ 
from counts for more recent periods.

All data in this report have been reviewed for accuracy by the data 
providers in each jurisdiction prior to publication.
