State-Administered Indigent
Defense Systems, 2013
******************************

Suzanne M. Strong, Ph.D., BJS Statistician

In 2013, 28 states and the District of Columbia had state-
administered indigent defense programs for the delivery of 
criminal defense services. ***Footnote 1 The administration of 
indigent defense in the District of Columbia was handled 
primarily by the Public Defender Service (PDS). See 
Methodology***. State-administered indigent defense systems were 
either completely funded and administered by the state, or were 
funded by the state and county but administered by the state. In 
most states, one central office managed the delivery of all 
methods of state-administered indigent defense. Alaska, Colorado, 
the District of Columbia, and Rhode Island had two offices that 
administered indigent defense. Twenty-four states and the District 
of Columbia used multiple delivery methods to provide indigent 
defense and four states used one delivery method (appendix table 
1). In 25 states and the District of Columbia public defenders 
were government employees.

By law, states must provide legal defense to those who were 
charged with a criminal offense involving a possible loss of 
liberty and who were unable to afford an attorney. Many states 
authorized some form of cost recovery for providing legal defense 
to indigent clients. Some states charged an application fee prior 
to providing legal representation, while other states charged 
recoupment, where a client pays all or a portion of the costs 
associated with legal representation or support services. In 
2013, 22 states and the District of Columbia charged indigent 
clients application fees, recoupment, or both (figure 1).

HIGHLIGHTS
*************

* Of the 28 states and the District of Columbia that had state-
administered indigent defense systems in 2013--

--Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia had either 
governmental or nongovernmental public defenders providing 
representation for indigent clients.

--Eight states and the District of Columbia required indigent 
clients to pay both an application fee to receive representation 
and recoupment for legal services provided.

--In nine states the governor appointed the chief executives 
of the indigent defense delivery system.

--Six states reported fewer than 10 full-time equivalent 
investigators on staff for public defender offices.

* Between 2007 and 2013, 16 of the 22 states with state-
administered public defender offices increased the number 
of full-time equivalent litigating attorneys.

* In 2013, state-administered systems closed an estimated 
2,696,950 criminal, appellate, civil, and juvenile cases.
**********************************************************

The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) 2013 National Survey 
of Indigent Defense Systems (NSIDS) was the first census of all 
state- and county-administered indigent defense systems. It was 
also the first collection of data focusing on criminal defense 
and civil, juvenile, and appellate representation. This report 
combined governmental, conflict, and nongovernmental public 
defenders into one category. Unless otherwise noted, the 
categories included public defenders, contract counsel, and 
assigned or appointed counsel.

States were able to delegate some or all of the responsibility 
of providing indigent defense to local jurisdictions or counties. 
This resulted in wide variability in how states supported 
indigent defense functions, such as developing standards, funding 
the system, determining educational and training requirements for 
attorneys, and managing and delivering indigent defense. Various 
organizations, including the American Bar Association, National 
Legal Aid and Defender Association, and National Juvenile 
Defender Center, have developed guidelines and standards for 
indigent defense systems. This report does not specifically 
address standards for any organizations.

**********************************************************
*************************************
Types of indigent defense systems
*************************************

In 1963, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Gideon v. 
Wainwright that states are required to provide counsel to 
indigent defendants accused of serious crimes under the 
Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In 1967, the 
Supreme Court again ruled in In re: Gault that the same right 
to counsel applied to indigent juveniles in delinquency hearings. 
In addition, in 1972, the Supreme Court ruled in Argersinger v. 
Hamlin that the right to counsel also applies to any misdemeanor 
charges that include the potential loss of liberty. Some states 
extend the right to counsel to other hearings that may involve a 
loss of liberty, including extradition, involuntary mental health 
commitments, nonpayment of child support, and cases involving 
juveniles, such as child dependency, abuse, and neglect cases.

Indigent defense systems provide representation using--

* governmental public defender office, which provides 
representation through publicly operated governmental offices 
where staff are government employees funded by the state or 
county governments.

* governmental conflict public defender office, which provides 
representation in cases where legal conflicts exist through 
a publicly operated governmental office and where staff are 
government employees.

* nongovernmental public defender office, which provides 
representation through written contracts between some 
governmental entity and a nonprofit entity. Staff are not 
government employees.

* contract system, which provides representation through 
contracts or other agreements between a governmental entity 
and one or more private attorneys or law firms that operate 
for-profit.

* assigned or appointed counsel system, which provides 
representation through individual attorneys or law firms. 
These attorneys are assigned or appointed on a case-by-case 
basis.
**********************************************************

***********************************
Two-thirds of reported cases were 
closed by public defender offices
***********************************

In 2013, state-administered indigent defense systems served an 
estimated 103,778,710 residents (table 1). The median number of 
cases closed per state was 75,560 (not shown in table). In 2013, 
public defenders closed 67% of cases, followed by assigned 
counsel (20%), contract counsel (13%), and conflict counsel (<1%) 
(appendix table 2).

Eighty-two percent of the total caseload reported in 2013 could 
be tracked by case type (table 2). State-administered indigent 
defense systems closed mainly misdemeanor, noncapital felony, and 
civil cases.

Of the reporting states, misdemeanor cases made up a majority 
of closed cases in four states, while felony cases made up the 
majority of closed cases in one state. Nearly a third of cases 
closed in New Jersey and Oregon (32% each) were civil cases.

***************************************
State-administered indigent defense 
systems employed 10,520 full-time 
equivalent attorneys in 2013
***************************************

States that reported caseloads by type of case reported an estimated 
10,520 full-time equivalent (FTE) litigating attorneys in 2013, 
ranging from a low of 40 in Rhode Island to a high of 1,620 in Maryland 
(table 3) *** Footnote 2 Respondents were asked to report full- and 
part-time attorneys, but the survey did not collect unit of count 
and may differ for assigned attorneys. See Methodology***. Overall, 
caseloads ranged from 50 cases for every FTE litigating attorney 
in Minnesota to 590 cases for every FTE litigating attorney in 
Arkansas. ***Footnote 3 This assumes that all cases and case 
types are evenly distributed across full-time equivalent (FTE) 
litigating attorneys. See Methodology***. Felony caseloads ranged 
from two cases for every FTE litigating attorney in Connecticut 
to 200 cases for every FTE litigating attorney in Arkansas. 
Misdemeanor caseloads ranged from 20 cases for every FTE 
litigating attorney in South Carolina to 290 cases for every 
FTE litigating attorney in Minnesota.

***************************************
Seven states reported that attorneys 
could reject cases if they exceeded 
caseload limits
***************************************

Twelve states and the District of Columbia had caseload limits 
for their attorneys in 2013 (figure 2). Ten states and the 
District of Columbia assigned an interim attorney to a case 
within 1 day of arrest, detention, or defendant’s request for 
an attorney. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia assigned 
a permanent attorney within 3 days.

In 2013, 17 states and the District of Columbia reported that the 
same attorney represented a client from assignment through all 
stages of the proceedings, called vertical representation. 
Nineteen states and the District of Columbia maintained a 
guideline that an attorney be present at bail hearings or 
arraignment. Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia 
reported that it had a guideline for the attorney to advise 
defendants about any plea bargains at any stage of prosecution, 
with 17 states and the District of Columbia reporting that it was 
a mandatory guideline (appendix table 3).

Most states reported that they required attorneys to be present 
at juvenile detention (23 states and the District of Columbia) 
and juvenile adjudication (25 states and the District of 
Columbia) hearings. Five states reported that they did not have 
guidelines regarding representation of juveniles at detention, 
and three states reported that they did not have guidelines for 
representation of juveniles at adjudication.

***************************************
Eight states required indigent clients 
to pay an application fee and all or 
a portion of their legal fees
***************************************

Eight states and the District of Columbia required the client to 
pay both an application fee and recoupment, where a client pays 
all or a portion of the costs associated with legal 
representation or support service (table 4). Four states required 
an application fee only. Application fees ranged from $10 in New 
Mexico to $212 in Arkansas. Ten states required payment for some 
portion of the client’s legal representation, but did not require 
an application fee, and six states did not require any fees.

States reported their annual expenditures, personnel costs, and 
revenue received for fiscal year 2013. Expenditures included all 
recurring fixed and variable costs associated with the operation, 
management, and administration of indigent defense systems, 
including personnel costs. It did not include nonrecurring fixed 
capital costs, such as building construction and major equipment 
purchases. State-administered indigent defense systems spent more 
than $1 billion in 2013 (not shown). Personnel costs included 
salaries and benefits of all full- and part-time personnel. For 
contract and assigned counsel systems, personnel costs included 
only the costs of the management or oversight of those systems. 
Attorneys paid by contract or under assignment are reported in 
later tables. State-administered indigent defense systems spent 
more than $900 million on personnel costs in 2013 (not shown). 
***Footnote 4 Wisconsin did not report personnel costs***.

States reported the amount and sources of revenue received. 
Alaska, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Virginia, and West 
Virginia were funded entirely by the state, while Delaware and 
the District of Columbia were funded entirely by the federal 
government (table 5). In comparison, Connecticut and Oregon were 
funded entirely from client application fees, while New Jersey 
was funded by recoupment.

States used a variety of factors to determine whether a client 
was indigent. Typically, indigence can be made by the court or 
by the indigent defense office. The survey did not ask who was 
responsible for determining a client’s indigence. Instead, it 
collected information on the factors used to determine indigence.

Connecticut, Kentucky, and Missouri (8 factors each) used the 
most factors to determine indigence, while Wyoming (2 factors) 
used the fewest (table 6). Twenty-seven states and the District 
of Columbia used income as a factor, while nine states used a 
defendant’s ability to post bond as a factor.

***************************************
The most common method of conflict 
management was to send the case 
to assigned counsel
***************************************

Overall, 27 states and the District of Columbia Public
Defender Service responded about conflict management.
Arkansas, New Jersey, Rhode Island (2 offices), and West Virginia 
reported that they did not maintain guidelines or policies for 
conflict of interest cases (not shown). Offices reported how 
cases were processed when an attorney had a conflict of interest. 
***Footnote 5 Delivery method responses were reported at the 
office level. That is, if one delivery method reported a conflict 
management strategy, it was marked for the office***. Offices 
could use more than one method of conflict management. The most 
common method reported by indigent defense offices was to send 
the case to an appointed counsel program administrator or 
directly to appointed counsel (figure 3).

***************************************
26 states employed 4,676 full-time 
equivalent line public defenders
***************************************

Many of the 28 state-administered indigent defense programs and 
the District of Columbia reported that their system had one FTE 
chief executive. Louisiana and North Carolina reported more than 
20 chief executives (table 7). Contract systems and assigned or 
appointed counsel systems were not asked about managing 
attorneys, supervising attorneys, or line attorneys. Of the 
reporting public defender and conflict public defender delivery 
systems, states and the District of Columbia reported 188 FTE 
managing attorneys, who did not litigate cases but managed staff, 
assessed attorney performance, and monitored indigent defense 
delivery. In addition, 25 states reported 580 FTE supervising 
attorneys, and 26 states reported 4,662 line public defenders.

All delivery methods were given the option to list the number of 
contract and assigned or appointed attorneys. Of those that 
reported, contract counsel ranged from 1 FTE in West Virginia to 
775 FTEs in Connecticut, and assigned or appointed counsel ranged 
from 4 FTEs in Louisiana to 1,220 FTEs in Virginia.

Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia reported that 
their indigent defense systems required their attorneys to have 
annual performance reviews (table 8). Additionally, 25 states and 
the District of Columbia mandated their attorneys to complete 
continuing legal education (CLE). 

State-administered indigent defense systems typically provided 
opportunities for professional development in criminal law (28), 
ethics (27), trial skills (27), and motions (26) 
(appendix table 4).

***************************************
More than 2,000 full-time equivalent 
employees provided support to public 
defenders in 2013
***************************************

Support staff are employees who are not typically attorneys, 
but persons who provide services such as legal research, 
investigation, clerical, and administrative services to public 
defenders and other indigent defense attorneys. State-
administered public defender systems employed investigators 
(944), social workers (252), paralegals (230), and law clerks 
or interns (614). For public defender and conflict offices, states 
and the District of Columbia ranged from 3 investigators (North 
Dakota) to 174 (New Jersey) (table 9). Eight states reported that 
they did not have any FTE social workers, seven states did not 
have any FTE law clerks or interns, and five states did not 
employ any FTE paralegals. An additional 2,900 trainers, 
indigency screeners, clerical, administrative, and other 
employees supported all methods of indigent defense delivery 
in 2013 (appendix table 5). About 60% of these support staff 
were clerical workers.

******************************************
State commissions appointed more than 
half of indigent defense chief executives 
******************************************

The 28 states and the District of Columbia reported 63 different 
chief executives. In 2013, half of the chief executives (32 of 
63) were appointed by a state commission or the equivalent for 
the District of Columbia (table 10). 

Nineteen percent (12 of 63) of the chief executives were 
appointed by the governor of the state. No chief executives 
were publicly elected (not shown). Sixty-eight percent 
(43 of 63) reported that the chief executive did not have 
a term limit.

**********************************************************

*********************************************
States increased the numbers of full-time 
equivalent litigating attorneys and support 
staff between 2007 and 2013
*********************************************

State-administered public defender office characteristics
from the 2013 National Survey of Indigent Defense Systems
(NSIDS) can be compared with data from the 2007 Census of
Public Defender Offices (CPDO). Twenty-two states reported
on public defender staffing in both 2007 and 2013. Most of
these states increased the number of full-time equivalent 
(FTE) litigating defenders; however, the number of FTE 
litigating defenders decreased in Minnesota, Montana, 
New Mexico, and Virginia (table 11).
**********************************************************

******************************************
Most state indigent defense advisory 
boards had the power to hire or remove 
the chief executive
******************************************

Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia had advisory 
boards or commissions in 2013. Of those, 18 states indicated that 
the governor was involved in appointing the advisory board 
members (appendix table 6). Seven of the 18 states indicated that 
the governor was the sole source of appointment for the advisory 
board. In 2013, 19 states and the District of Columbia with 
advisory boards indicated that the board had the power to hire 
and remove the chief executive of the indigent defense system 
(table 12). Thirteen states indicated that the advisory board 
administered or managed the indigent defense system budget, and 
10 states indicated the advisory board established the number and 
types of personnel for the indigent defense system. One state 
(Kentucky) reported that the advisory board had none of the 
powers listed, while 9 states reported their advisory boards had 
every power listed.

*********************************************
16 states used contract counsel and 14 
states and the District of Columbia used 
assigned counsel in 2013
*********************************************

Eleven states awarded contracts through the public defender for 
the provision of indigent defense in 2013 (table 13). Of these, 
six states indicated that the contracting process was competitive 
throughout the state. The process of payments for attorneys that 
provided indigent defense under contracts varied widely by state. 
Two states paid a flat rate per month or per year, while eight 
states indicated that the process of payment varied by county or 
by case.

Eight states indicated that a state commission, public defender 
office, or assigned counsel administrator maintained a list of 
eligible assigned counsel for the whole system (table 14). Four 
states and the District of Columbia indicated that each 
individual court maintained a list for all judges in the court, 
and two states indicated that each judge maintained a list.

Seven states and the District of Columbia maintained both a 
formal application and removal procedure for attorneys on the 
assigned counsel list. Seven states reported that the hourly 
rate did not vary by case type. Most reporting assigned counsel 
systems reported that there was no maximum limit to the amount 
an attorney could bill for a case (not shown).

*********************************************
Most state-administered indigent defense 
systems reimbursed attorneys for out-of-
pocket expenses
*********************************************

Twenty-four (92%) state-administered governmental public defender 
offices, including the District of Columbia, reimbursed attorneys 
for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in 2013. Four in five (80%) 
nongovernmental public defender offices reimbursed attorneys for 
out-of-pocket expenses. (figure 4). All six conflict public 
defender offices reimbursed attorneys for out-of-pocket expenses 
incurred. More than 80% of contract systems (13 in 16) and 
assigned attorney systems (13 in 15) reported that they 
reimbursed attorneys for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in 2013.

Methodology
*************

Survey overview
*****************

The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National Survey of
Indigent Defense Systems (NSIDS) is the first data collection
from all forms of indigent defense delivery in the United
States. The NSIDS furthers the work of the 2007 Census
of Public Defender Offices (CPDO) and the 1999 Survey
of Indigent Defense Systems. NORC at the University of
Chicago fielded the both the 2007 CPDO and the 2013
NSIDS on behalf of BJS. This report is based on data
from state-administered indigent defense systems. A
state-administered indigent defense system is one in which
one or two offices coordinate the funding and delivery of
indigent defense throughout the entire state. A forthcoming
report will be based on data from the county-administered
indigent defense systems. NSIDS collected information
about the type of indigent defense delivery methods,
caseloads, personnel and staffing, conflict management,
funding and fees collected by indigent defense systems, and
tracking of graduates.

Universe identification
*************************

The universe list of indigent defense systems began with the
2007 CPDO. The list of public defenders was supplemented
by the National Legal Aid and Defender Association
(NLADA) for state-administered systems. The universe
included state-administered indigent defense systems that
handled felony cases, and included data on all of the other
cases handled by that system, including misdemeanors,
juvenile, appellate, and civil cases. The universe did not
include indigent defense provided in tribal court systems or
municipal court systems.

For the majority of this report, the unit of count is the state.
The District of Columbia is neither a state nor a county;
however, the provision of indigent defense was handled
primarily by the Public Defender Service (PDS). Any cases
that the District of Columbia’s PDS could not handle were
referred to a panel of attorneys called the Criminal Justice
Act (CJA) panel (i.e., Criminal Justice Act of 1964). Data for
the NSIDS were collected from the offices responsible for
state-administered indigent defense. Two offices had to be
combined to report at the state level for Alaska, Colorado,
the District of Columbia, and Rhode Island. Virginia’s
Indigent Defense Commission responded to the survey
and reported the information for the state’s public defender
system. The survey was not sent to the Virginia Supreme
Court, mistakenly. While New Hampshire had one main
office for the provision of indigent defense, the survey was
sent to both the New Hampshire Public Defender and the
New Hampshire Judicial Council. Staff worked with the New
Hampshire Judicial Council to reconcile differences between
the responses received from the public defender and the
judicial council.

The original universe list included the 50 states and the 
District of Columbia. State-administered indigent defense systems 
included 28 states and the District of Columbia. The remaining 22 
states will be included in the forthcoming county-administered 
report.

Response rate
**************

The survey was sent to 35 state offices in 28 states and the 
District of Columbia in November 2014. The initial contact letter 
contained a link to a web-based survey and an access code for 
respondents to enter and complete the survey online. Later in the 
data collection, offices were sent links to the web survey and a 
paper questionnaire. Data collection continued through October 
2015, with a reference year of 2013. If the indigent defense 
office did not respond to the survey, staff followed up with 
phone calls and emails to the respondent. After repeated follow-
up, the survey reached a 100% unit response rate. Twenty-five 
offices (71%) completed the survey online and 10 offices (29%) 
completed the paper questionnaire.

Item nonresponse
*******************

The NSIDS included 57 total questions; however, the web survey 
contained logic for skip patterns. That is, an office indicating 
that it used public defenders for indigent defense delivery saw 
only questions related to public defenders, not questions for 
assigned or contract counsel. If an office indicated it used all 
methods of delivery, it received all questions. For responding 
offices, there was no discernible pattern to item nonresponse. 
Overall, the item nonresponse rate for each question was less 
than 20%, unless otherwise noted in the tables.

Accuracy of the estimates
**************************

Because the NSIDS was designed to be a census of all indigent 
defense delivery methods and the state-administered portion 
received a 100% unit response rate, any error should come from 
item nonresponse.

Definition of a case
*********************

A case was defined as a set of all charges against a single 
defendant that were handled by the court as a single matter. A 
case referred to a single defendant. A case with three defendants 
was recorded as three cases, but a case with one defendant with 
multiple charges was counted as one case. 

Further, respondents were asked to count the number of cases 
closed, meaning that they were to count cases where a judgment 
of conviction, acquittal, or dismissal with or without prejudice,
was entered by the court. Cases closed are presented, unless 
otherwise noted.

Full-time equivalent and workload estimates
*********************************************

Full-time equivalent (FTE) is typically calculated by dividing 
the hours worked by part-time employees by the standard number 
of hours for full-time employees (40 hours per week), then adding 
the resulting quotient to the number of full-time employees. The 
unit of count may be different by type of attorney. That is, a 
public defender may be considered full time at 40 hours per week, 
while an assigned attorney may be considered full time based on 
the number of cases received. Because the survey only asked for 
counts of full- and part-time employees and not about the hours 
worked, FTE was calculated by adding the total number of reported 
full-time employees to half of the reported part-time employees, 
or FT+(PT*0.5). This assumes that two part-time employees on 
average equates to one FTE employee and makes it difficult to 
compare FTE employees across delivery methods.

To estimate overall attorney workload by case type, the number 
of case types closed in a state was divided by the number of full-
time equivalent attorneys in a state. This assumes that attorneys 
do not specialize by case type but handle every case type, and 
that cases are evenly distributed to all litigating attorneys, 
regardless of whether they are supervisors who litigate cases, 
attorneys with many years of experience, or recently hired 
attorneys.

State-specific notes on indigent defense systems
*************************************************

Alaska: Public Defender Agency did not provide case counts, 
but provided attorney counts. Alaska’s Office of Public Advocacy 
provided case counts but not attorney counts.

Arkansas: Reported total number of cases differed from caseload 
summed by reported number of cases by case type. Numbers reflect 
caseload summed by case type.

Connecticut: Did not have the death penalty in 2013. However, 
it was not retroactive, and 11 prisoners were on death row.

District of Columbia Superior Court: Did not track cases and did 
not report the number of attorneys on staff. Caseload and number 
of FTE numbers reflect District of Columbia Public Defender 
Service only.

Maryland: Did not report. Maryland abolished the death penalty in 
2013. Numbers reflect cases opened in calendar year 2013 obtained 
from the Fiscal Year Annual Report from the Office of the Public 
Defender.

Montana: Reported 222 part-time contract attorneys that were 
shared by the three delivery methods (public defender, conflict 
public defender, and contract counsel). The 110 FTE contract 
employees were reported as contract employees because they were 
paid through a contract.

New Mexico: Repealed the death penalty in 2009, though it was not 
retroactive. Two inmates were on death row in New Mexico in 2015. 
New Mexico reported 110 capital cases in fiscal year 2013. New 
Mexico has 5 classes of felony offenses, the most serious of 
which is the capital felony, which is likely reported in this 
category.

North Carolina: Tracked cases by fee applications. The numbers 
presented are not necessarily cases closed. 

Virginia: The survey was not sent to the Virginia Supreme
Court for assigned/appointed counsel information. The
information on assigned/appointed counsel system was
taken from the Supreme Court’s 2013 Yearly Report on Legal
or Medical Services provided. Only those attorneys provided
under Virginia statute 19.2-163 were included in the tables.

Wyoming: Administered an indigent defense and a guardian ad litem 
program. This report only addresses data for the indigent defense 
program.
