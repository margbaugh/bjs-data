On June 30, 2000, 1,394 of the Nation's
1,558 State public and private adult
correctional facilities reported that they
provide mental health services to their
inmates.*Excluded from this report are locally
operated jails and Federal confinement
facilities.*  Nearly 70% of facilities
housing State prison inmates reported
that, as a matter of policy, they screen
inmates at intake; 65% conduct
psychiatric assessments; 51% provide
24-hour mental health care; 71% provide
therapy/counseling by trained mental
health professionals; 73% distribute
psychotropic medications to their
inmates; and 66% help released inmates
obtain community mental health
services.

One in every 8 State prisoners was
receiving some mental health therapy or
counseling services at midyear 2000. 
Nearly 10% were receiving psychotropic
medications (including antidepressants,
stimulants, sedatives, tranquilizers, or
other anti-psychotic drugs).  Fewer than
2% of State inmates were housed in a
24-hour mental health unit.

This report is based on the 2000 Census
of State and Federal Adult Correctional
Facilities, an enumeration of all 84
Federal facilities, 1,320 State facilities,
and 264 private facilities in operation on
June 30, 2000.  For the first time, the
2000 census included items related to
facility policies on mental health
screening and treatment. 

Inmates screened at admission and
placed in general confinement or
specialized facilities

State prison systems typically screen
inmates for mental disorders at a
reception/diagnostic center prior to
placement in a State facility.  As of 
June 30, 2000, 161 facilities reported 
serving this function, including at 
least 1 in every State.  Nearly all of 
these facilities (153) reported that 
they either screened inmates or conducted 
psychiatric evaluations to determine 
inmate mental health or emotional status.  

In addition, 155 facilities (in 47 
States) reported mental health/psychiatric
confinement as a special function.  Only
three States -- North Dakota, Rhode
Island, and Wyoming -- lacked a special
psychiatric confinement facility.  In 
these States inmates needing special 
confinement separate from other inmates 
are placed in State hospitals, prison 
infirmaries, or in special needs units 
within general confinement facilities.

Mental health services most
commonly provided in maximum/
high security confinement facilities

Facility policies relating to mental 
health screening, assessment, and treatment
vary by type of facility and security level. 
Community-based facilities, in which 50% or 
more of their inmates are regularly permitted 
to depart unaccompanied, are less likely 
(82%) than State confinement facilities (95%) 
to have policies related to mental health
screening and care. 

On each mental health policy considered, 
about half or fewer of the community-based 
facilities reported having such a policy.  
The most common policy for community-based
facilities was providing assistance to
released inmates to obtain mental health
services in the community (51%). The
least common was providing 24-hour
mental health care to inmates (20%).

Among confinement facilities, the most
common forms of treatment were
therapy/counseling (84%) and
distribution of psychotropic medications
(83%). At least three-quarters of the
facilities reported screening inmates at
intake and conducting psychiatric
assessments.  Nearly two-thirds of
confinement facilities reported that
24-hour mental health care was
available to inmates either on or off
facility grounds.

Mental health screening and treatment
policies were more frequently reported
by maximum/high security facilities than
by minimum/low security facilities. 
Almost all maximum security confinement 
facilities (99%) reported conducting 
screening and providing some form of 
treatment.  The most common (95%) was 
the distribution of psychotropic medications 
and providing mental health therapy/
counseling.

Overall, 125 facilities reported that they
didn't provide any mental health services
to inmates. Of these facilities, 75 were
community-based and 41 were minimum/low 
security confinement facilities.  The 
absence of mental health policies within 
these facilities may reflect the confinement 
and treatment of mentally ill inmates 
elsewhere within the State systems. On 
June 30, 2000, fewer than 1.8% of all 
State inmates were held in facilities in 
which mental health services were not 
available. 

Based on inmate self-reports, at
midyear 2000 State prisons held
191,000 mentally ill inmates

In the Special Report, Mental Health
Treatment of Inmates and Probationers
(NCJ 174463), BJS estimated that
16.2% of State prisoners were mentally
ill.  Drawing from inmate surveys
conducted in 1997, BJS found that
10.1% of State inmates reported a
mental or emotional condition and 10.7%
said they had stayed overnight in a
mental hospital or program. Though
these estimates depend on inmate
self-reports, they provide an overall
measure of the need for mental health
treatment in State prisons.  Assuming
these percentages have not changed
since the surveys were conducted, an
estimated 191,000 inmates in State
prisons were mentally ill as of midyear
2000.

13% of State inmates were receiving
mental health therapy; 10% were
receiving psychotropic medications

The 2000 prison census findings reveal
a great diversity in the amount and type
of treatment being provided among State
correctional facilities.  Overall, 1.6% of
all inmates (or about 10% of all those
identified as mentally ill) were receiving
24-hour care in special housing or a
psychiatric unit. Inmates in public
facilities (1.8%) and confinement
facilities (1.8%) were somewhat more
likely than those in private facilities
(1.1%) and community-based facilities
(0.3%) to be receiving 24-hour care.  
 
Nearly 13% of State inmates (or about
79% of those mentally ill) were receiving
mental health therapy or counseling
services from a trained professional on a
regular basis.  The percent receiving
therapy was the highest in female-only
confinement facilities (with more than 1
in 4 female inmates receiving therapy)
and in maximum/high security facilities
(with nearly 1 in 6 inmates in therapy). 
Facilities also reported that nearly 10%
of all inmates (an estimated 114,400
inmates nationwide) were receiving
psychotropic medications. The use of
these drugs (including antidepressants,
stimulants, sedatives, and tranquil-
izers) was the most common in facilities
specializing in mental health
confinement (45%),  medical treatment
facilities (22%), and female only
confinement facilities (22%).  

General confinement facilities
provided most mental health 
treatment 

The 2000 census identified 155 facilities
that specialize in mental health/
psychiatric confinement.  Twelve of
these facilities reported that their 
primary function (identified by the 
largest number of inmates) was mental 
health confinement.   In some States 
these facilities are used to house mentally 
ill inmates separately from the general
population; in other States they are used
to remove inmates in response to acute
episodes for a short term.  The most
severely mentally ill may be transferred
to outside agencies (such as State
mental hospitals and secure psychiatric
hospitals) for long-term treatment.  

Facilities with mental health confinement
as their primary function are typically
smaller than other facilities.  Between
July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000, these
facilities had an average daily population
of 690 inmates, compared to an average 
of 1,460 in facilities that provide
specialized care but hold other inmates
as well.  On June 30, 2000, these 12
facilities held more than 8,124 inmates,
and, on average, were operating at
about 88% of their rated capacity.

The majority of inmates receiving
therapy/counseling and medications
were housed in facilities without a
mental health specialty.  Nearly 70% of
all inmates receiving therapy and  65%
of those receiving psychotropic
medication were in general confinement
or community-based facilities. 
In contrast, most inmates receiving
24-hour mental health care (80%) were
receiving that care in a specialized
confinement facility.

In 5 States nearly 20% of inmates
receiving pyschotropic medications 

Excluding States in which fewer than
90% of inmates were in facilities
reporting on mental health items, the
census found that the use of
psychotropic medications was most
common in Hawaii, Maine, Montana,
Nebraska, and Oregon (with nearly 20%
of all inmates) and least common in
Alabama, Arkansas, and Michigan (with
fewer than 5% of inmates receiving
medications).

In four States -- Louisiana, Nebraska,
Maine, and Wyoming -- facilities
reported that at least a quarter of all
State inmates were receiving mental
health therapy or counseling services.  
Among all States,  only Hawaii, which
operates an integrated prison and jail
system, reported that fewer than 5% of
their inmates were receiving mental
health therapy/counseling. 

Among all correctional facilities, the
Louisiana State Penitentiary in Baton
Rouge reported the largest number of
inmates in therapy (1,736), followed by
the California Men's Colony in San Luis
Obispo (1,721), the California Medical
Facility in Vacaville (1,300), and the
Indiana Wabash Valley Correctional
Facility (1,021).

Methodology

The 2000 Census of State and Federal
Adult Correctional Facilities was the
sixth enumeration of State institutions
sponsored by the Bureau of Justice
Statistics.  Earlier censuses were
completed in 1974, 1979, 1984, 1990,
and 1995.  

The facility universe was developed from
the 1995 census.  Each department of
corrections was contacted to identify
new facilities and facilities that had 
been closed since June 30, 1995.  Data 
were collected from all facilities, 
resulting in a final response rate of 
100%.

Facilities were included in the census 
if they had separate staffs; housed
primarily State or Federal prisoners;
were physically, functionally, and
administratively separate; and operational 
on June 30, 2000.  Overall, the census 
identified 84 Federal facilities, 1,295 
State facilities, 22 facilities under 
State and local authority, 3 facilities 
operated by the District of Columbia, 
and 264 privately-operated facilities. 

The census included the following types
of adult correctional facilities: prisons
and penitentiaries; boot camps; prison
farms; reception, diagnostic, and
classification centers; road camps,
forestry and conservation camps;
youthful offender facilities (except in
California); vocational training facilities;
prison hospitals; drug and alcohol
treatment facilities; and State-operated
local detention facilities (in Alaska,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode
Island, and Vermont).

Facilities were classified as community
based if 50% or more of their inmates
were regularly permitted to leave
unaccompanied or if their primary
function was community corrections.
Such facilities included halfway houses
and restitution, prerelease, work release,
and study release centers. 

Correctional facilities were classified as
confinement facilities if fewer than 50%
of the inmates are regularly permitted to
leave unaccompanied.  On June 30,
2000, 463 State facilities were
community-based and 1,121 were
confinement facilities.

All Federal facilities and 26 privately-
operated facilities that held at least 50%
of their inmates for Federal authorities
were excluded from this report.  Data on
policies and the numbers of inmates
receiving mental health treatment within
these facilities on June 30, 2000, were
not available.
