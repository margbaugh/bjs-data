and 1999
  
Total           112,611
Local police     91,072

*  State and local law enforcement agencies had nearly
113,000 community policing officers or their
equivalents during 1999, compared to about 21,000 in
1997.  This included 91,000 local police officers in
1999, up from 16,000 in 1997.
   
*  64% of local police departments serving 86% of all
residents had full-time officers engaged in community
policing activities during 1999, compared to 34% of
departments serving 62% of residents in 1997.

*  In 1999, 87% of local police officers were employed
by a department that provided community policing
training for some or all new recruits, and 85% by a
department that provided it for at least some
in-service officers.

*  In 1999, 63% of local police departments serving
85% of all residents used routine foot and/or bicycle
patrol.  About half of all officers worked for a
department that actively encouraged them to engage in
problem-solving projects on their patrol beats.

*  As of June 30, 1999, 69% of local police
departments, serving 96% of all residents, had met
with community groups within the past year; and 40% 
of departments, serving 71% of residents, had formed 
a problem-solving partnership within the past 3 years.  

*  During 1999, 92% of residents were served by a
local police department that provided them with
routine access to crime statistics or crime maps,
compared to 70% in 1997.  
----------------------------------------------------------

The community policing approach to law enforcement
seeks to address the causes of crime and reduce the
fear of crime and social disorder through
problem-solving strategies and police-community
partnerships.  A fundamental shift from traditional
reactive policing, community policing strives to
prevent crime before it occurs. 

As part of an ongoing partnership between the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the Office 
of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS), data 
were collected on the community policing practices 
of State and local law enforcement agencies in 1997 
and 1999. The Law Enforcement Management and 
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey was used 
to assess the impact of community policing on 
personnel, training, policies, programs, and the 
use of technology.

The LEMAS survey

Begun in 1987, the LEMAS survey periodically collects
data from State and local law enforcement agencies. 
All agencies employing 100 or more sworn personnel 
are included, as well as a representative sample of
smaller agencies.  LEMAS surveys have been conducted
in 1987, 1990, 1993, 1997, and 1999.  COPS provided
funding for the 1997 and 1999 surveys, and both
surveys included a section devoted to community
policing. 

The 1999 LEMAS survey questionnaire was mailed to
3,319 agencies, including primary State law
enforcement agencies, sheriff's departments and
offices, local police departments, and certain 
types of special jurisdiction police departments.  
(See Methodology on page 11.)

A total of 3,246 State and local agencies provided
data for the 1999 survey for a response rate of 
97.8%. Included were 2,052 of the 2,085 local police
departments that received the questionnaire, a
response rate of 98.4%.  In 1997, 2,012 of 2,097 
local police departments provided data, resulting 
in a response rate of 95.9%.    

More than 17,500 agencies and nearly 700,000 full-
time sworn personnel are represented by the data 
collected in the 1999 LEMAS survey.

or special law enforcement responsibilities.

for all data cited in this report are June 30, 
1997, and June 30, 1999.

Community policing personnel

As of June 30, 1999, local police departments employed
an estimated 436,182 full-time sworn personnel and
served approximately 195 million residents nationwide. 
About 90% of these departments served a population of
less than 25,000 residents, accounting for about 30%
of all full-time local police officers.  Nearly half
of all local police officers were employed by 1% of
departments that served a population of 150,000 or
more.

One important measure of the level of local police
involvement in community policing is the number of
full-time sworn personnel who serve as community
policing officers, community resource officers,
community relations officers, or otherwise regularly
engage in community policing activities.

From 1997 to 1999, the percentage of local police
departments with community policing officers nearly
doubled -- from 34% to 64%.  During this time the
number of such officers increased from about 16,000 
to about 91,000.  (See Methodological note on page 11
regarding comparisons of data from the 2 years.)

In 1999 all departments serving a population of 1
million or more and about 90% of those serving 
25,000 to 999,999 residents were using community 
policing officers.   

Among departments using community policing officers,
the average number so designated increased from 3 in
1997 to 11 in 1999.  Large increases were reported
among departments in all population categories.  In
the smallest communities the average number of
community policing officers doubled, and it more than
doubled in all other categories.  In 1999 the average
number of community officers ranged from 1,728 in the
largest jurisdictions to 2 in the smallest.  

-----------------------------------
The Crime Act of 1994 and the Office of Community
Oriented Policing Service (COPS)

The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act 
(the Crime Act) was signed into law by President 
Clinton on September 13, 1994.  Of the $30 billion 
in expenditures authorized by this legislation, 
nearly $9 billion was authorized for Title I, also 
known as the Public Safety Partnership and Community 
Policing Act of 1994.  Title I was the basis for the 
creation of the Department of Justice's Office of 
Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program.  
Since 1994, to advance community policing, COPS has 
provided over $7.5 billion in Federal funds to over 
12,000 State and local law enforcement agencies.

The COPS office was charged with  changing the
practice of policing in the United States by --
*  Deploying an additional 100,000 community 
policing officers
*  Facilitating problem-solving efforts
and encouraging interactions with communities 
by officers
*  Promoting innovation in policing
*  Enhancing existing technologies to assist 
officers in preventing and responding to crime 
and its consequences.  

To achieve these goals, the COPS program used three
primary approach-es.  The first was to award 3-year
grants to agencies for hiring officers.  The second
was to award grants for acquiring technology and 
hiring civilians so officers could be redeployed 
to perform community policing activities.  The third 
was to award grants to agencies for innovative programs
with special purposes such as reducing gun violence or
domestic violence.  All COPS grant programs were
designed to supplement local expenditures, not to
supplant or replace them. Title I required that COPS
funds be distributed equally between jurisdictions
above and below a population of 150,000.

The LEMAS data are a rich source of information about
community policing; however, they are not intended to
be used to determine whether the goals of the COPS program 
have been met.  For more information on the COPS program, 
see the National Evaluation of the COPS Program, National 
Institute of Justice (NCJ 183643), or visit the COPS 
website at www.usdoj.gov/cops
---------------------------------------

In 1997 about 4% of all local police officers were
serving as community policing officers.  By 1999 the
percentage of officers serving as community policing
officers or otherwise regularly engaged in community
policing activities had increased to 21%.

In jurisdictions with 500,000 or more residents, the
percentage of full-time sworn personnel serving as
community policing officers increased from 1.4% to
24.1% (figure 1).  

Percent of full-time sworn personnel 
in local police departments serving 
as community policing officers, by 
size of population served, 1997 
and 1999
 
                    1999     1997
500,000 or more     24.1%     1.4%
150,000 - 499,99    14.4%     4.7%
50,000 - 149,999    16.9%     4.8%
10,000 - 49,999     18.4%     4.6%
Less than 10,000    28.3%     5.6%

Large increases occurred in other population categories 
as well:  In jurisdictions with 150,000 to 499,999 
residents, from 4.7% to 14.4%; in those with 50,000 to 
149,999 residents, from 4.8% to 16.9%; in those with 
10,000 to 49,999 residents, from 4.6% to 18.4%, and in 
jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000 residents, 28.3% 
of sworn personnel were serving as community policing 
officers in 1999 compared to 5.6% in 1997.
                                    
At the agency level, a small proportion of officers
devoted to community policing may indicate
experimentation, while a majority of officers so
assigned may reflect the adoption of a organizational
philosophy based in community policing.  

In 1997 just 7% of all local police departments, and
none of those serving 50,000 or more residents, had 
at least half of their officers serving as community
policing officers.  By 1999, the overall percentage
had risen to 29%, and the percentages among population
categories of 50,000 or more ranged from 4% to 25%.  
Among departments serving 2,500 to 9,999 residents, 
the percentage with at least half their officers 
serving as community policing officers increased 
from 2% to 23%, and in departments  serving
fewer than 2,500 residents, from 15% to 41%.

Training for community policing

In support of their widespread use of community
policing officers, just over  half of local police
departments offered 8 or more hours of training in
community policing to some or all new officer recruits
in both 1999 and 1997.  About two-fifths of all
departments  trained all of their new recruits in
community policing.  

Such training helps officers develop skills in areas
integral to successful community policing such as
problem-solving, SARA***Footnote 1: SARA is a problem-
solving approach first proposed by Herman Goldstein.
For a brief description see <www.policeforum.org/
sara.html>.***  (scanning, analysis, response, 
assessment), and community partnerships.

In 1999, 96% of the departments serving 500,000 or
more residents  trained all new recruits in community
policing, as did more than 80% of those serving
150,000 to 499,999 residents.  Nearly half of the
departments serving 2,500 to 9,999 residents, and
about a  fourth of those serving fewer than 2,500
residents trained all recruits in community 
policing.

In 1999, 63% of local police departments provided
community policing training to at least some of 
their in-service sworn personnel.  Twenty-eight 
percent of departments trained all in-service 
officers.  As with new recruits, the percentage 
of departments that trained in-service officers 
in community policing was about the same in 1999 
as in 1997.

The percentage of local police officers that were
employed by a department that trained some or all 
new recruits in community policing increased 
slightly from 1997 to 1999 (figure 2).

a department providing community policing 
training to some or all employees, by category 
of trainee, 1997 and 1999
  
                          1999       1997
New officer recruits      87.0%      83.0%
In-service officers       85.0%      84.0%
Civilian personnel        50.0%      48.0%

In 1999, 87% of officers were employed by a department 
that trained new recruits in community policing compared 
to 83% in 1997.  For training of in-service officers 
the comparable figures were 85% in 1999 and 84% in 
1997; for training of civilian personnel, 50% in 
1999 and 48% in 1997.

Community policies and programs
and policies
   
These nationwide increases -- in the number of
departments using community policing officers and 
in the proportion of sworn personnel designated as
community policing officers -- have been accompanied
by the continued prevalence of community-oriented
policies, programs, and activities.

Agency community policing plans

In both 1997 and 1999, about two-thirds of local
police departments had some type of community 
policing plan.  About a fourth of those with a 
plan, a sixth of departments overall, had a formally 
written plan, indicating that community policing 
approaches and goals were incorporated into the 
overall agency strategic plan.  The remainder had 
informal, unwritten community policing plans. 

In both years a majority of the community policing
plans of departments serving a population of 50,000 
or more were formal, written plans, while departments 
in smaller jurisdictions were more likely to have an
unwritten plan.

Foot and bicycle patrol

Routine foot or bicycle patrol is a commonly used
means to increase police-community interaction.  
From 1997 to 1999, the percentage of local police
departments using routine foot patrol increased from
28% to 34%, and the percentage using routine bicycle
patrol went from 50% to 53%.  In 1999, 63% of
departments, including nearly all of those serving a
population of 50,000 or more, used one or both of
these patrol types on a routine basis. 

Of the approximately 195 million U.S. residents served
by a local police department, 85% were served by one
that used foot and/or bicycle patrol on a routine
basis during 1999, compared to 78% in 1997 (figure 3).

Either type         85.0%      78.0%
Bicycle             76.0%      66.0%
Foot                68.0%      59.0%
 
From 1997 to 1999, the percentage of residents served
by a department using bicycle patrol went from 66% to
76%, and the percentage served by a department with
foot patrol from 59% to 68%.   

Geographic assignment

Assigning patrol officers in fixed geographic- and
time-stable beats or areas, often referred to as
"territorial stability," is thought to increase the
level of officer attachment to an area and its
residents.  Further, stability of assignment may
facilitate certain goals of community policing, such
as the development of citizen and business contacts
and formation of problem-solving partnerships.

In both 1997 and 1999, 42% of local police departments
gave their patrol officers responsibility for specific
geographic areas or beats.   This included about 90%
of those  serving 50,000 or more residents. Overall,
about 4 in 5 local police officers worked for a
department that followed this practice.   

Departments using routine foot or bicycle patrol and
giving officers responsibility for specific geographic
areas or beats were about 5 times as likely to have
full-time community policing officers as departments
not implementing these strategies.  

In both 1997 and 1999, fewer than 1 in 10 local police
departments gave their investigators responsibility
for specific geographic areas or beats.  However, a
majority of departments serving 50,000 or residents
used this practice and nearly half of all local police
officers were employed by a department that did so. 

Problem solving

A central component of community policing is the
process of identifying and responding to community
problems.  This process is often put into operation 
at the street level using the SARA problem-solving 
model. The process may be facilitated by activities 
such as holding meetings with citizen groups, forming
problem-solving partnerships, and training citizens 
in community policing.

In 1999 nearly a third of local police departments,
employing about half of all officers, actively
encouraged patrol officers to engage in SARA-type
problem-solving projects on their beats.  From 1997 
to 1999 the largest increase occurred among departments
serving 50,000 to 149,999 residents.

Including problem-solving projects in the criteria 
of performance evaluations of patrol officers is an
important way departments can encourage and support
community policing efforts. About a sixth of local
police departments, employing about a third of all
officers, did so in 1999.  The largest increase from
1997 to 1999 in the use of such criteria was among
departments serving 250,000 to 499,999 residents.

During the 3-year period ending June 30, 1999, 40% 
of local police departments formed problem-solving
partnerships with community groups, municipal
agencies, or others through specialized contracts or
written agreements.  This included at least 70% of the
departments in each population category of 25,000 or
more, and covered 71% of all served by a local police
department.  
 
Meetings with citizens are considered to be essential
to the development of long-term solutions to community
problems.  About two-thirds of local police departments, 
serving 96% of all residents, reported meeting with 
citizens on a regular basis during the year ending 
June 30, 1999. Nearly all agencies serving populations 
of 10,000 or more residents regularly met with 
citizen groups during this period.

Among departments holding regular meetings, a variety
of citizen groups were typically involved (figure 4).

Types of groups that local police departments
regularly met with to discuss crime-related 
problems, 1999
 
School groups                     76.0%
Neighborhood associations         52.0%
Business groups                   50.0%
Senior citizen groups             45.0%
Domestic violence groups          41.0%
Youth service organizations       33.0%
Religious groups                  30.0%
Advocacy groups                   26.0%
Tenants' associations             19.0%
 
The largest percentages of departments met with school
groups (76%), followed by neighborhood associations
(52%), business groups (50%), senior citizen groups
(45%), and domestic violence groups (41%) (figure 4).
Meetings with youth service organizations (33%),
religious groups (30%), advocacy groups (26%), and
tenants' associations (19%) also occurred.  In
addition, 40% of departments reported regular 
meetings with local public agencies.

During the 3-year period ending June 30, 1999, about 
a third of departments offered community policing
training to citizens on topics such as community
mobilization and problem solving.  This included a
majority of those serving 10,000 or more residents 
and about 90% of those serving 150,000 or more 
residents.

Local police departments with a formally written
community policing plan were much more likely to 
have implemented strategies such as geographic patrol
assignments (72%), support for officer problem-solving
projects (57%), community policing training for
citizens (55%), and problem-solving partnerships (49%)
than those with only an informal community policing
plan or no community policing plan at all (figure 5).

Information sharing and 
measurement

Citizen input and feedback

Community policing requires law enforcement agencies
to take a new approach to both the identification of
problems and the measurement of police performance. 
Success in addressing issues such as social disorder
and the fear of crime cannot be determined solely
through data about arrests or calls-for-service.  

Some level of citizen input and feedback is often
thought to be essential to accurately assess police
performance, and systematic citizen input and feedback
is preferred.  To this end, 27% of local police
departments surveyed citizens to gather information 
in 1999, and 30% did so in 1997.  In both years, a
majority of the departments serving 25,000 or more
residents conducted at least 1 citizen survey.  

Among departments conducting surveys, 89% collected
information on public satisfaction with police
services, 63% collected information on public
perceptions of crime and disorder problems, and 
38% collected information on the personal crime
experiences of citizens.

Local police departments reported using their survey
data for a wide variety of purposes (figure 6).

Purposes for which police departments used
information collected in citizen surveys, 
1999
  
Providing information to officer           72.0%
Evaluating program effectiveness           57.0%
Prioritizing crime/disorder problem        52.0%
Officer training                           42.0%
Formulating policy/procedures              42.0%
Allocating resources to neighbor           39.0%
Redistricting beat/reporting are           16.0%

Among departments conducting surveys in 1999, the most
common use of the data was providing information to
patrol officers (72%).  A majority also used survey
data to evaluate program effectiveness (57%) and
prioritize crime and disorder problems (52%).  

Other uses of survey information included formulating
agency policy and procedures (42%), officer training
(42%), allocating resources to targeted neighborhoods
(39%), and redistricting beats and reporting areas
(17%). 

Police input and feedback

To identify and prioritize local problems, the police
and citizens need to share information.  At a minimum,
citizens need to have some access to local crime
information.  

In 1999, 73% of local police departments provided
citizens with routine access to crime statistics,
compared to 36% in 1997.  This doubling largely
occurred from the increased availability among
departments serving fewer than 50,000 residents.  
The percentage of residents served by a local 
police departments that provided such access rose 
from 70% in 1997 to 92% in 1999.

Among departments providing access to crime 
statistics in 1999, nearly all provided it 
to those making their request in person (90%) 
(figure 7).  

Methods for accessing crime 
statistics provided to citizens 
by local police departments, 1999
  
 
In-person                   90.0%

Internet                    10.0%

More than half provided access by telephone 
(57%) or written request (56%), and about 
two-fifths provided it through newspapers 
(40%) or agency reports (38%).

Less common methods of routine access provided 
to citizens were fax (16%), radio (14%), 
newsletter (14%), television (11%), and Internet 
(10%). Although still relatively low in 1999, the 
percentage of departments providing  access 
to crime statistics that allowed citizens to 
use the Internet for this purpose was double 
that of 1997.  

During the year ending June 30, 1999,  3% of 
the departments providing routine citizen access 
to crime statistics, covering 11% of the total 
population served by such departments, conduct-ed 
training classes for citizens on how to use or 
analyze crime statistics or crime maps.  

In 1999, 83% of the departments providing routine
citizen access to crime statistics did so with data
compiled at the county or city level.  Statistics 
at a more detailed level such as neighborhood (29%), 
street (22%), patrol beat (19%), address (17%), 
apartment complex (14%), district or precinct (12%), 
or census tract (2%) were much less likely to be 
routinely available (figure 8).

Technology and community policing

Crime mapping 

Technology plays a central role in the advancement 
of community policing by helping law enforcement 
agencies to become more efficient and effective 
problem solvers.  Technological tools such as 
computerized crime mapping assist agencies in 
identifying and analyzing problems, developing 
long-term solutions, and evaluating their problem-
solving efforts.  

In 1999, nearly twice as many local police departments
were using computers for crime mapping purposes as in
1997 (32% versus 17%).  This included more than 90%
of those serving 150,000 or more residents, and 76% of
those serving 50,000 to 149,999 residents.  Overall,
departments using computerized crime mapping in 1999
covered 71% of the total population served by local
police departments (figure 9).

Arrests                         46.0%
Business locations              32.0%
Census data                     14.0%
     

A variety of data types were geocoded and mapped, with
the most common type being crime incidents, mapped by
departments covering 60% of the total population
served by local police departments.  Other data types
and the corresponding population coverage percentages
were as follows: calls for service (50%) arrests (46%), 
business locations (32%), and census data (14%).

Community outreach

Technology can also assist in community outreach.  
In 1999, 18% of local police departments, covering 
62% of all residents served by a local police 
department, maintained a agency home page on the 
Internet.  This represented an increase over 1997 
when 11% of departments, serving 48% of all residents, 
had an Internet home page.  In 1999, about 9 in 10
departments serving a population of 250,000 or more
residents had a home page, as did about 7 in 10
departments serving 50,000 to 249,999 residents.

Such websites are typically used to provide citizens
with crime and police-related information.  They can
also increase police-citizen contact through e-mail
and information sharing regarding crime problems and
related issues.
  
In-field computers

In-field computers such as laptops, car-mounted
computers/terminals, and hand-held computers/terminals
assist problem-solving efforts by providing patrol
officers with direct access to vital information.  
As of June 30, 1999, nearly a third of local police 
departments, employing nearly three-fourths of all 
local police officers, were using in-field computers.  
These proportions were similar to those reported in 
1997.  Nearly 9 in 10 departments serving 150,000 or 
more residents were using in-field computers in 1999.

In departments where patrol officers used in-field
computers, a variety of information resources were
available to them.  In 1999, a majority of local
police officers worked for a department where
information on wanted suspects (62%) and driving
records (54%) were accessible to least some patrol
officers through the use of in-field computers(figure 10).

Wanted suspects                            62.0%
Driving records                            54.0%
Stolen property                            48.0%

Mapping programs                           13.0%

Other information accessible to patrol officers by
in-field computer in local police departments and 
the corresponding percentage of officers employed 
by such departments included stolen property records 
(48%), calls for service history at dispatched location
(42%), criminal history records (39%), crime analysis
software (15%), and mapping programs (13%).

---------------------
The COPS MORE Grant Program 

COPS offers support to State and local agencies
through a variety of different grant programs.   
One such program, COPS MORE (Making Officer 
Redeployment Effective), was begun in 1995 to 
redeploy officers to the street by funding 
technology, equipment, and support personnel.  

When agencies can purchase computers and hire
civilians for support positions, officers who 
would otherwise be engaged in support functions 
can be redeployed to the street in community 
policing roles.

With the assistance of COPS MORE funding, the 
growth in the use of computers for administrative 
purposes that began in the early 1990's continued 
through the decade.  From 1990 to 1999, the 
percentage of departments using personal/desktop 
computers (PC's), nearly doubled, from 40% to 78%.  

The growth in new use of PC's is primarily
concentrated among departments serving smaller
populations.  Among departments serving 
populations of less than 10,000 residents, the 
percentage using PC's went from 29% in 1990 to 
72% in 1999.  Nearly all departments serving 
populations of 50,000 or more have reported using 
PC's since 1990.  COPS MORE grants have funded 
these agencies to update or enhance their
computer capabilities.

Methodology

The Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) survey collects data from a
nationally representative sample of the publicly
funded State and local law enforcement agencies in 
the United States.  See the BJS report Local Police
Departments, 1997 (NCJ 173429) for information on 
the 1997 LEMAS sampling methodology.

The 1999 LEMAS survey questionnaire was mailed to
3,319 State and local law enforcement agencies.  
The initial mailing of the questionnaire was conducted 
in June 1999, and June 30, 1999, was generally used as
the reference date for survey questions.  

Allowing for the exclusion of certain types of special
jurisdiction police, 895 law enforcement agencies in
the U.S.  with 100 or more sworn officers as of June
30, 1996, were included in the sample as self-
representing (SR) agencies.  This included 529 local 
police departments, 306 sheriffs' offices, the 49 
primary State law enforcement agencies, and 11 special 
jurisdiction police agencies.

The self-representing (SR) agencies were supplemented
by a nationally representative sample of agencies 
with fewer than 100 sworn officers.  These nonself-
representing (NSR) agencies were chosen using a 
stratified random sample with cells based on the type 
of agency (local police, sheriff, or special police), 
size of population served, and number of sworn officers.   
The 2,424 NSR agencies selected included 1,556 local 
police departments, 694 sheriffs' departments and 
offices, and 174 special jurisdiction police agencies.  

A total of 3,246 agencies responded to the LEMAS
survey for a response rate of 97.8%.  This included
883 SR agencies and 2,363 NSR agencies.  The final
database includes  2,052 local police departments, 
967 sheriffs' departments, 178 special jurisdiction 
police departments, and the 49 primary State police
departments. 

The base weight for all SR agencies is 1.  For NSR
local police departments, the base weights are
determined by number of sworn officers employed as 
of June 30, 1996.  For agencies with 0 to 6 sworn
officers, the base weight is 15.55; for 7 to 13
officers, it is 9.65; for 14 to 23 officers, it is
7.09; for 24 to 39 officers, it is 4.95; for 40 to 
62 officers, it is 3.38; and for 63 to 99 officers, 
the base weight is 2.14.

The final weight associated with every agency, both 
SR and NSR, is the product of the base weight, a 
factor that adjusted for changes in the universe since 
1996, and a factor that adjusted for any nonresponding
agencies in each cell. 

Some responding agencies did not fully complete the
LEMAS questionnaire.  When an agency did not supply a
response to an item, median value imputation or ratio
imputation was used.  Median value imputation uses the
median value of an item reported by agencies in the
same sample cell.  Ratio imputation uses the median
value of a ratio reported by agencies in the same
sample cell. 

Median value imputation was used to impute counts of
facilities, mainframes, minicomputers, reserve sworn
officers, community service officers, and nonsworn
volunteers.  Ratio imputation was used to impute
counts of employees and all other computer equipment. 
Every imputed item on the database has an indicator
that the value has been imputed.  Complete
documentation regarding sampling procedures and
nonresponse adjustments is available upon request.

Because the data from agencies with fewer than 100
sworn personnel were collected from a sample, the
results are subject to sampling error.  Statements 
of comparison in this report have been tested to 
ensure that observed differences between values are
significant at 2 standard errors (the 95-percent
confidence level) or higher.  The survey data are 
also subject to response and processing errors.

Methodological note   In 1997 agencies were asked 
for the number of full-time sworn personnel whose 
regular assigned duties included serving as a 
community policing officer.  In 1999 this definition 
was reworded to ask for the number of full-time 
sworn personnel serving as community policing officers,
community resource officers, community relations
officers, or others regularly engaged in community
policing activities.
