Highlights

*  Of serious nonfatal violent victimizations, 28% were committed 
with a firearm, 4% were committed with a firearm and resulted in 
injury, and less than 1% resulted in gunshot wounds. 

*  Of all nonfatal firearm-related injuries treated in emergency 
departments, 62% were known to have resulted from an assault.  For
firearm-related fatalities, 44% were homicides.

*  The number of gunshot wounds from assaults treated in hospital 
emergency departments fell from 64,100 in 1993 to 39,400 in 1997, 
a 39% decline. Homicides committed with a firearm fell from 18,300 
in 1993 to 13,300 in 1997, a 27% decline. 

*  Four out of five of the victims of both fatal and nonfatal 
gunshot wounds from crime were male.

*  Almost half of the victims of both fatal and nonfatal gunshot 
wounds from crime were black males. About a quarter were black 
males ages 15 to 24.

*  Over half the victims of nonfatal gunshot wounds from crime 
were younger than 25. Older victims were more frequent in the 
homicide statistics.

*  Over half of the victims of nonfatal firearm injury from crime 
who went to an emergency room were subsequently hospitalized 
overnight.

Firearm injuries from crime include those caused by interpersonal 
violence regardless of whether the injured party was the intended 
target or even a perpetrator. Such injuries can be fatal (homicides) 
or nonfatal (assaults).  Incidents resulting in firearm injury may 
involve other crimes like robbery and burglary but are referred to 
as assaults.  While injuries other than gunshot wounds can result 
from crimes involving a firearm, this report focuses on gunshot 
wounds. 

No single source of data completely measures firearm injury and 
deaths from crime. Several sources cover only fatalities while 
others cover nonfatal injury. For example, the National Crime 
Victimization Survey (NCVS) does not include data about victims 
who died.  In addition, while the NCVS provides a wealth of 
information about crime and victims, it does not capture enough 
cases involving gunshot wounds to provide annual estimates of many 
of the characteristics of such events.  Hospital emergency department
surveillance systems are able to collect additional cases and 
details about victims of nonfatal gunshot wounds but do not collect
information about victims who do not seek treatment in hospitals 
(about 20% of all victims of nonfatal gunshot wounds, according 
to the NCVS).

To describe firearm injury and death from crime, this report uses 
data from victim surveys, hospital emergency departments, death 
certificates, and law enforcement reports on homicides.  (See the 
box on page 5 and the Methodology for additional discussion 
of sources of data concerning firearm injury.) 

How much crime involves firearms 
and gunshot wounds?
 
The BJS National Crime Victimization 
Survey (NCVS) data for 1993-97 show
that of the 19.2 million incidents of 
nonfatal violent crime, excluding simple 
assault --
*  28% were committed with a firearm
*  4% were committed with a firearm and resulted in injury
*  less than 1% resulted in gunshot wounds.  

According to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, 30% of the murders, 
robberies, and aggravated assaults reported to police from 1993 
to 1997 involved firearms. Of these violent crimes, 1% were murders. 
Of all murders from 1993 to 1997, 69% were committed with firearms.

How many people are injured by 
firearms and how many of these 
injuries are the result of crime?

According to the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey 
conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
0.4% of all injury visits to hospital emergency departments from 
1992 to 1995 were caused by firearms (4 of every 1,000 
visits.)***Footnote 1:   C.W. Burt and L.A. Fingerhut.  "Injury
visits to hospital emergency department: United States, 1992-95," 
National Center for Health Statistics, Vital Health Statistics,
13:131,1998.***  This estimate includes all causes of firearm 
injury and may include visits for patients seeking follow-up care 
and patients who died at the hospital. 

Estimates from the CDC Firearm Injury Surveillance Study show that 
from 1993 through 1997, about 412,000 nonfatal firearm-related 
injuries were treated in U.S. hospital emergency departments.

Of the total nonfatal firearm injuries -- 
62% resulted from assaults
*  17% were unintentional
*  6% were suicide attempts
*  1% were legal interventions
*  13% were from unknown causes.

While most nonfatal firearm-related injuries are from crime, 
most firearm-related deaths are suicides. According to the Vital 
Statistics, 180,533 firearm deaths occurred from 1993 through 
1997: 51% were suicides, 44% homicides, 1% legal interventions, 
3% unintentional incidents, and 1% were of undetermined causes.   

The number of nonfatal assaults 
and homicides from firearms 
declined from 1993 to 1997

From 1993 to 1997 nonfatal firearm injuries from crime declined 
39% and firearm-related homicides fell 27%.  Firearm injury and 
deaths from other causes also declined over the period.  Firearm 
injuries resulting from suicide attempts declined 45%, and those 
from unintentional causes declined 39%. Unintentional deaths from 
firearms fell by 36% and suicides fell by 7%.

The ratio of nonfatal to fatal gunshot 
injuries varies by intent    

From 1993 through 1997 there were 3.3 nonfatal gunshot injuries 
from assault treated in hospital emergency departments for every
firearm-related homicide. For gunshot injuries sustained 
unintentionally, there were 11.4 nonfatal injuries for every gunshot 
fatality. Firearm-related suicide attempts were the most likely to 
result in a fatality, as there were 0.3 firearm-related attempted 
suicides for every completed suicide.***Footnote 2: V. Beaman, J.L. 
Annest, J.A. Mercy, M. Kresnow, and D.A. Pollock, "Lethality of
firearm-related injuries in the United States population," Annals of 
Emergency Medicine, 35:258-266, 2000.***        

Most victims of gunshot injury and 
death from crime were male; almost 
half were black males

From 1993 to 1997 --
*  Eighty-nine percent of the victims of nonfatal gunshot wounds 
from crime were male; 84% of firearm homicide victims were male, 
according to the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR).

*  Blacks made up 54% of the victims of nonfatal gunshot wounds from 
crime and 54% of the homicide victims.

*  Almost 1 in 5 victims of nonfatal gunshot wounds from crime were 
Hispanic. Equivalent data for homicide victims are not available in 
the SHR.  According to the Vital Statistics, 18% of the homicide victims 
were Hispanic.

Black males ages 15 to 24 made up 26% of all the victims of 
nonfatal gunshot wounds from crime and 22% of the homicide victims. 

While the majority of victims of nonfatal and fatal gunshot wounds 
from crime were black, most victims of unintentional firearm injury 
and death and suicides and suicide attempts with firearms were white.

Different sources of data on firearm 
injury from crime show consistent 
demographic patterns

A comparison of two sources of firearm homicide data to the CDC's 
data on nonfatal firearm injury from crime shows similar demographic 
patterns among victims. Black males are the most frequent victims of 
firearm homicide and nonfatal firearm injury from crime. Young people 
are also more frequently victims in all three sources. One explanation 
of why older victims are more frequent in the homicide statistics is 
that they are less able than younger victims to recover from gunshot 
wounds.  

Although these sources have different population coverage 
(see Methodology), the homicide victims in the Vital Statistics 
and the FBI's Supplementary Homicide Reports appear to be very 
similar. Some of the differences between these sources and the 
firearm injury study are due to differences in population coverage 
or to the estimation procedures used with the firearm injury 
surveillance sample.

Juveniles (persons under age 18) accounted for 16% of the victims 
of nonfatal gunshot wounds from crime and 10% of the firearm 
homicide victims.  Thirty-five percent of the victims of nonfatal 
gunshot wounds from crime and 24% of the homicide victims were 
under 21 years of age.

Homicide offenders are also likely to be young. According to the 
Supplementary Homicide Reports from 1993 to 1997, 60% of the offenders 
who used a firearm to commit murder were younger than 25; 17% were 
juveniles and 24% were between ages 18 and 20. (The Youth Handgun 
Safety Act of 1994 prohibits possession of handguns by anyone under 
18, and under the Gun Control Act of 1968 it is unlawful for federally
licensed firearms dealers to sell handguns to persons under 21.)

About two-thirds of the victims of gunshot wounds from crime who 
were treated in emergency departments were taken to the emergency 
department by an emergency medical service, ambulance, or rescue 
squad.

Victims of unintentional firearm injury differ from gunshot victims 
from crime in that a higher percentage come to hospital by private 
vehicle than any other means.

Where were victims of nonfatal 
gunshot assaults wounded?

Data from the CDC study of nonfatal firearm injury show that almost 
half of the victims shot as a result of an assault received wounds 
to the extremities (arms, hands, legs, or feet).  Over a third of 
firearm assault victims were shot in their trunk, and the remainder 
were shot in their head or neck.   

By contrast, over two-thirds of the victims of unintentional gunshot 
wounds were shot in their arms, legs, or feet, while two-thirds of 
the people who attempted suicide were shot in their head, neck or 
upper trunk. 
 
Most victims of nonfatal firearm 
assaults who are treated in an 
emergency room are subsequently 
hospitalized 

The CDC data show that 53% of the victims of nonfatal gunshot 
wounds from assaults (an estimated 137,000) were hospitalized at 
least overnight after their initial treatment in an emergency room.  
(95% confidence interval estimates the number to be between 84,900 
to 189,000.  See Methodology.)  The remainder (46%) were released 
after being treated or transferred.  An earlier CDC firearms study 
estimated that about 92% of the victims hospitalized for firearm 
injury were discharged from the hospital alive.***Footnote 3: J. L.
Annest and others, "National Estimates of Nonfatal Firearm-Related
Injuries: Beyond the Tip of the Iceberg," Journal of the American
Medical Association, 273, 22:1749-54, June 14, 1995.***

Data from the NCVS on nonfatal firearm crimes for 1993-97 show 
that over half of the victims of gunshot wounds who sought treatment 
were treated and released.

Other characteristics of the events 
involving gunshot wounds from crime

For many victims of nonfatal and fatal gunshot wounds from crime, 
little is known about the event.  For nonfatal injuries covered in 
the CDC study, much of this information is unavailable in hospital 
emergency departments.  For fatalities, the police may not know or 
may not report any information about the event other than it was a 
homicide.  This section outlines the details about events involving 
gunshot wounds from crime from one or more of the sources used.  

Type of firearm 

For 59% of the victims of nonfatal gunshot wounds from crime 
in the CDC study, the type of firearm used was unknown. Where 
the firearm type was known, 82% of the victims were shot by
handguns, 14% by shotguns, and 4% by rifles.

In the Supplementary Homicide Reports from 1993 through 1997, 
81% of those killed with firearms were killed with a handgun, 
6% with shotguns, 5% with rifles, and 7% with unspecified
firearms.  The SHR does not collect additional detail about the 
firearm.

Criminal circumstances 

Information about whether the injury resulted from another crime, 
such as a robbery or from a physical fight, was recorded for about 
a third of the cases in the CDC study. 

Of the victims of firearm homicide included in the Supplementary 
Homicide Reports from 1993
through 1997--
*  28% were killed because of an argument
*  19% were killed during the commission of another crime, 
including 11% during a robbery and
7% during
a drug law violation 
*  7% died as a result of a juvenile gang killing.

Location of the assaults that 
resulted in gunshot wounds

The CDC study found that the location of the assault was --
*  unknown by hospital staff in half the incidents
*  a street or highway in 23%
*  a home, apartment, or condominium in 14%
*  other property, including schools or recreation areas, in 13%.  

In 2% of the cases, the assault was reported to have occurred 
when the victim was on the job.  In the text descriptions provided 
by hospital staff, the term "drive-by" was used to describe what
happened to 12% of the victims of nonfatal gunshot injury from 
assaults. Similar data are not available from the SHR.

Relationship of injured victims to 
their attackers

In more than half of the cases in the CDC study, the victim's 
relationship to the offender was not reported.  When relationship
was reported, 49% of the victims were attacked by strangers and
28% did not see who shot them.

Data from the BJS 1994 Study of Injured Victims of Violence 
(SIVV) show that intentional gunshot cases were less likely to 
contain information about the person who inflicted the injury
than incidents involving intentional injuries not caused by a 
firearm.  Among cases of nonfatal violent injuries treated in U.S. 
emergency departments in 1994, 55% of gunshot cases did not
include information about the relationship of the victim to the 
offender compared to 27% of the cases involving non-gunshot 
injuries.

The relationship to the offender was unknown in 41% of the firearm 
homicides in the Supplementary Homicide Reports from 1993 through 
1997.  The killer was a stranger to the victim in 15% of the homicides.  
In 44% of the homicides during the period, the killer was
known to the victim including --
*  31% in which the victim and offender 
were friends or acquaintances 
*  12% in which the killer was a relative 
or intimate of the victim.  

------------------------------------------------------------
How often are police officers injured 
in assaults with firearms?

In 1998, over 400 police officers were injured in firearm assaults 
and 58 police officers were killed by a firearm while responding to 
a crime. The firearm injury rate for police officers declined in the 
early 1980's and began climbing again after 1987.  In the late 1990's, 
firearm injury rates fell to the lowest levels recorded during the 
1978-98 period.

The greatest decline in the number of officers killed by firearms 
occurred in the early 1980's. The number of officers injured by 
firearms during an assault rose during the late 1980's and early
1990's and declined sharply after 1992.  As a result, the ratio 
of those injured to killed from firearm assaults has been decreasing.

What information is available about firearm 
injury and death from crime and interpersonal 
violence?

Firearm homicide data from several sources have been available 
for many years including:  
*  Vital Statistics of the United States, 
which collects data from death certificates filed
throughout the Nation
*  Supplementary Homicide Reports, which include data reported to 
the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program by State and local law 
enforcement agencies on a voluntary basis.  

Both can provide State and local data as well as national data.  
Both systems also have
limitations. (See additional discussion of these sources in the 
Methodology.)  Neither collects any information from medical 
examiners or crime laboratories.

Little data on nonfatal firearm injuries were available until 
recently.  While many jurisdictions have laws mandating the 
reporting of gunshot wounds to law enforcement, there is no 
national registry of such injuries.

CDC initiated the Firearms Injury Surveillance Study in June 
1992.  As discussed in the Methodology, this study collects data 
about gun-related injuries treated at hospital emergency departments 
through the Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic 
Injury Surveillance System. This study produces national estimates 
from a sample of hospital emergency departments.

Much of the firearm injury information relevant in the criminal 
justice context, like data about the offender and the circumstances, 
is not well reported in a hospital-based collection. Emergency 
department personnel are primarily concerned with treating victims. 
In addition, victims may be unable or unwilling to share information 
about the incident.

The National Crime Victimization Survey provides a detailed picture 
of crime incidents, victims, and trends occurring each year in the 
United States.  Because firearm crime and resulting injury are 
relatively rare when compared to all types of crime, the NCVS 
provides limited information about gunshot injuries from crime. 
No local data are available from the NCVS.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is currently implementing an 
improved crime reporting system, the National Incident-based 
Reporting System (NIBRS), which has the potential to provide 
detailed statistics about crime, including crimes committed with 
firearms that result in either  nonfatal or fatal injury.  Currently, 
40 States are in some stage of development or implementation of 
NIBRS.

NIBRS covers those incidents where victims of firearm crime are 
known to the police.  The information from NIBRS about the type of 
injuries incurred or the type of firearm used is limited. 

Additional sources of data concerning firearm injury not specifically 
related to crime also exist.  For a comprehensive discussion of all 
these sources, see J.L. Annest and J.A. Mercy, "Use of National Data 
Systems for Firearm-Related Injury Surveillance" in "Firearm-Related 
Injury Surveil-lance," R.M. Ikeda, J.A. Mercy, and S.P. Teret, eds., 
American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 15, 3S, October 1998.

Methodology

CDC Firearms Injury Surveillance Study -- These data were compiled 
through the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission's (CPSC) National
Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS).  The CPSC established 
NEISS in 1972 to track product-related injuries.  NEISS collects 
data from hospitals selected as a representative sample of the 
approximately 6,000 hospitals with emergency departments in the 
United States.
From 1993 through 1996, 91 hospitals were in the sample; in 1997 
the number of hospitals increased to 101. The system includes very 
large inner-city hospitals with trauma centers, as well as other 
types of urban, suburban, and rural hospitals. Data from the NEISS 
hospitals are weighted to provide national estimates about injuries 
treated in U.S. hospital emergency departments.  

Through an agreement with CDC, NEISS was used to collect data on 
nonfatal gun-related injuries at all participating hospitals 
beginning in June 1992.  NEISS personnel abstracted information from 
medical records on each case identified.  Further information about 
the study can be found in J.L. Annest and others, "National Estimates 
of Nonfatal Firearm-Related Injuries: Beyond the Tip of the Iceberg,
" Journal of the American Medical Association, June 14, 1995.  

The CDC data for 1993 through May 1997 consists of 13,402 unweighted 
cases. This report focuses on the 8,988 unweighted cases coded as 
assaults that involved nonfatal gunshot wounds caused by any weapon 
that uses a powder charge to fire a projectile. Injuries from 
undetermined intent were not included.  Therefore, the estimates 
presented here may not be the same as those previously published.

Because the CDC data are based on nonfatal firearm injuries 
treated at a nationally representative sample of U.S. hospital 
emergency departments, the estimates that are derived from the 
data are subject to sampling error.  To measure the precision of 
national estimates obtained from the data, CDC estimated the 
generalized standard errors for estimates of selected sample size 
as follows:

                     Relative
                     sampling
           Standard  error in   95% confidence
Estimate   error     percent    interval
   1,000       309      31%        394-1,606
   5,000     1,200      24%      2,648-7,352
  10,000     2,230      22%     5,629-14,371
  25,000     5,225      21%    14,759-35,241
  50,000    10,050      20%    30,302-69,698
 100,000    19,600      20%   61,584-138,416
 150,000    29,100      19%   92,964-207,036
 257,000    49,344      19%  160,286-353,714

The Bureau of Justice Statistics also used NEISS to collect 
information about both firearm and nonfirearm intentional 
interpersonal injury. The BJS Study of Injured Victims of Violence 
(SIVV) collected data from 31 hospitals in the NEISS sample during 
1994.  The information on intentional firearm injury in the BJS 
study comes from the CDC firearm injury data. A BJS special report,
Violence-Related Injuries Treated in Hospital Emergency 
Departments, (August 1997, NCJ-156921) presents findings from 
this study.

The National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) -- 
Conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this survey is designed 
to collect data on the utilization and provision of ambulatory care 
services in hospital emergency and outpatient departments. Findings 
are based on a national sample of visits to the emergency departments 
and outpatient departments of non-institutional general and short-stay
hospitals, exclusive of Federal, military, and Veterans Administration
hospitals, in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. 

The survey uses a four-stage probability design with samples of 
geographically defined areas, hospitals within these areas, clinics, 
hospitals, and patient visits within clinics. Annual data collection 
began in 1992.

National Crime Victimization Survey   The NCVS is the Nation's 
primary source of information on criminal victimization.  The survey 
provides a detailed picture of crime incidents, victims, and trends 
occurring each year in the United States.  The survey collects 
information on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape, sexual 
assault, personal robbery, aggravated and simple assault, household 
burglary, theft and motor vehicle theft utilizing a nationally 
representative sample of approximately 43,000 households (about 
80,000 persons).  

The survey provides information about victims (such as age, gender, 
and race), offenders (age, gender, and race) and the crimes (use of 
weapons, nature of injury, etc.).  From 1993 through 1997, the 
NCVS recorded 43 unweighted cases of gun shot injury from crime.

Firearm homicide data -- Firearm homicide data come from two 
primary sources: 
*  Vital Statistics of the United States, which collect data from 
death certificates filed throughout the Nation
*  Supplementary Homicide Reports, which include data reported to 
he Uniform Crime Reporting Program of the FBI by State and local law
enforcement agencies on a voluntary basis.

The Vital Statistics information includes the demographic 
characteristics of firearm homicide victims and is thought to 
be an accurate count of the number of such deaths.  It does not 
contain information about the circumstances surrounding the death, 
the type of firearm used, or suspected offenders.  The Supplementary 
Homicide Reports provide such detailed information.  However, not 
all agencies report, and not all reports are complete.  

Vital Statistics reported 78,620 firearm-related homicides from 
1993 through 1997.  Supplementary Homicide Reports covering this 
period include data on 67,459 firearm-related murders.

The homicide data from the Vital Statistics and the Uniform 
Crime Reports provide slightly different estimates of the number 
of homicides annually.  Rokaw and others attributed this to
differences in -- 
*  coverage of the U.S. population 
*  practices or rules governing the reporting of homicides 
to NCHS and the FBI 
*  criteria used in defining a case as a homicide 
*  categories used and rules employed to classify people 
among demographic subgroups.

Statistics and the Uniform Crime Reports estimates of homicide

Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted -- This FBI series 
provides detailed information about duty-related deaths including 
those that result from felonious actions.  Federal, State, and
local agencies notify the FBI of line-of-duty deaths.  Once notified, 
the FBI contacts the victim officer's employing agency for additional 
details surrounding the death.

In addition, State and local agencies report the number of assaults 
resulting in serious injury or instances where a weapon was used 
which could have caused serious injury or death.  Other assaults are 
recorded only if they involved more than verbal abuse or minor 
resistance to arrest. Data are submitted monthly to the FBI.
