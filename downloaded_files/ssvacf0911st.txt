Survey of Sexual Violence in Adult Correctional Facilities, 
2009–11 - Statistical Tables

Ramona R. Rantala, BJS Statistician, Jessica Rexroat, BJS 
Intern, and Allen J. Beck, Ph.D., BJS Statistician
In 2011, correctional administrators reported 6,660 
allegations of sexual victimization in prisons. Of these, 605 
were substantiated based on follow-up investigation. Local 
jail authorities reported 2,042 allegations, of which 284 
were substantiated. About half (51%) involved allegations of 
nonconsensual sexual acts or abusive sexual contacts of 
inmates with other inmates, and half (49%) involved staff 
sexual misconduct or sexual harassment directed toward 
inmates.  While the overall number of allegations reported by 
authorities in adult correctional facilities rose from an 
estimated 6,241 in 2005 to 8,763 in 2011, the number of 
substantiated incidents did not change significantly from 
2005 (885) to 2011 (902).

Data are from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) Survey 
of Sexual Violence (SSV), which has annually collected 
official records on allegations and substantiated incidents 
of inmate-on-inmate and staff-on-inmate sexual victimization 
since 2004. The SSV is one of a number of BJS data 
collections that are conducted to meet the mandates of the 
Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA).

On behalf of BJS, staff of the U.S. Census Bureau mailed 
survey forms to correctional administrators in the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons, state prison systems, public and private 
jails, private prisons, jails in Indian country, and 
facilities operated by the U.S. military and Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement (ICE). Administrators were given the 
option of mailing back a completed form or completing it on 
the internet. Data collection forms can be accessed on the 
BJS website. The administrators then completed a separate 
form for each substantiated incident, providing details about 
the victim, perpetrator, and circumstances surrounding the 
incident.

The 2009, 2010, and 2011 surveys included all federal and 
state prisons, facilities operated by the U.S. military and 
ICE, and a representative sample of jail jurisdictions, 
privately operated jails and prisons, and jails holding 
adults in Indian country. In total, data were collected from 
facilities containing 1.99 million inmates in 2009, 1.98 
million inmates in 2010, and 1.97 million inmates in 2011. 
(See Methodology for more information about the systems and 
facilities from which data were collected.)

The statistical tables that follow provide counts of 
allegations and substantiated incidents by type of 
victimization for every jurisdiction and facility in the 
2009, 2010, 2011 surveys. These tables accompany BJS report, 
Sexual Victimization Reported by Adult Correctional 
Authorities, 2009–11, NCJ 234904, which provides national 
estimates and rates of sexual victimization as well as an in-
depth examination of substantiated incidents covering the 
number and characteristics of victims and perpetrators, 
location, time of day, nature of the injuries, impact on the 
victims, and sanctions imposed on the perpetrators.

******************************
Defining sexual victimization
******************************

To define sexual victimization under the Prison Rape 
Elimination Act of 2003, BJS uses uniform definitions that 
classify each sexual act by the perpetrator who carried out 
it (i.e., inmate or staff) and the type of act.
Inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization involves sexual contact 
with a victim without his or her consent or with a victim who 
cannot consent or refuse. 

Nonconsensual sexual acts are the most serious 
victimizations, and include--

* contact between the penis and the vagina or the penis and 
the anus including penetration, however slight

* contact between the mouth and the penis, vagina, or anus

* penetration of the anal or genital opening of another 
person by a hand, finger, or other object.

Abusive sexual contacts are less serious victimizations, and 
include--

* intentional touching, either directly or through clothing, 
of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or 
buttocks of any person

* incidents in which the intent was to sexually exploit 
(rather than to harm or debilitate).

Staff-on-inmate sexual victimization includes both consensual 
and nonconsensual acts perpetrated on an inmate by staff. 
Staff includes an employee, volunteer, contractor, official 
visitor, or other agency representative. Family, friends, and 
other visitors are excluded.

Staff sexual misconduct includes any act or behavior of a 
sexual nature directed toward an inmate by staff, including 
romantic relationships. Such acts include—

* intentional touching of the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, 
inner thigh, or buttocks with the intent to abuse, arouse, or 
gratify sexual desire

* completed, attempted, threatened, or requested sexual acts

* occurrences of indecent exposure, invasion of privacy, or 
staff voyeurism for sexual gratification.
Staff sexual harassment includes repeated verbal statements 
or comments of a sexual nature to an inmate by staff. Such 
statements include--

* demeaning references to an inmate’s sex or derogatory 
comments about his or her body or clothing

* repeated profane or obscene language or gestures.

Methodology

Sampling
**********

The sampling designs for the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ 
(BJS) 2009, 2010, and 2011 Survey of Sexual Violence (SSV) 
varied according to the different facilities covered under 
PREA.

***************************
Federal and state prisons
***************************

In each year, the survey included the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons and all 50 state adult prison systems. Prison 
administrators were directed to report only on allegations of 
sexual victimization that occurred within publicly operated 
adult prison facilities and to exclude allegations involving 
inmates held in local jails, privately operated facilities, 
and facilities in other jurisdictions.

*****************************
Privately operated state and 
federal prisons
*****************************

In each year, a sample of 125 privately operated state and 
federal prison facilities was drawn to produce a sample of 
the private prisons identified by the 2005 Census of State 
and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities. The sampling frame 
of privately operated prison facilities contained 417 
facilities in 2009 and 2010 and 393 in 2011 (after removing 
prisons that had closed). Facilities were sorted by average 
daily population (ADP) in the 12-month period ending June 30, 
2005. In 2009 and 2010, 71 facilities with ADPs of 488 or 
more were selected with certainty because of their size. In 
2011, 69 facilities with ADPs of 445 or more were selected 
with certainty (i.e., given a 100% chance of selection in 
each sample because of their size).

The remaining facilities were sorted by region (i.e., the 
Northeast, Midwest, South, or West), state, and ADP, and 
sampled systematically with probabilities proportional to 
their size. Fifty-four facilities were selected in 2009 and 
2010, and 56 in 2011. ***Footnote 1 The chance that a 
facility would be selected was directly related to the size 
of the facility (i.e., within each stratum, facilities with 
larger ADPs had a greater chance being selected than 
facilities with smaller ADPs).***

Among the privately operated prisons selected for the survey, 
3 had closed prior to data collection in 2009, 14 in 2010, 
and 10 in 2011. Three facilities selected in 2009 were out-
of-scope. Six privately operated prisons did not respond to 
the survey in 2009:

* Carver Correctional Center, Oklahoma City, OK

* Crossroads Adult Transitional Center, Chicago, IL

* Dismas Charities, El Paso, TX

* Dismas House, St. Louis, MO

* Joseph Coleman Center, Philadelphia, PA

* Stepping Stones (Community Alcohol Drug Center), Mitchell, 
SD.

All selected and active privately operated prisons in 2010 
and 2011 participated in the survey.

*************
Public jails
*************

In each year, 700 publicly operated jail facilities were 
selected based on data reported in BJS’s Deaths in Custody 
Reporting Program (DCRP). Based on the DCRP data in each year 
prior to the survey, the largest jail jurisdiction was 
selected in 45 states and the District of Columbia 
***Footnote 2 Five states with combined jail-prison systems 
had no public jails: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode 
Island, and Vermont.***

Jail jurisdictions with ADPs greater than or equal to 1,000 
inmates were also selected with certainty (128 in 2009, 131 
in 2010, and 117 in 2011). The remaining jail jurisdictions 
on the frame were then grouped into three strata.

* In the 2009 sample, 99 jails (out of 1,489) with an ADP of 
85 or fewer inmates were selected in the first stratum, 317 
jails (out of 770) with an ADP of 86 to 268 inmates were 
selected from the second stratum, and 110 jails (out of 434) 
with an ADP of 269 to 999 inmates were selected from the 
third stratum.

* In the 2010 sample, 117 jails (out of 1,476) with an ADP of 
85 or fewer inmates were selected in the first stratum; 247 
jails (out of 762) with an ADP of 86 to 267 inmates were 
selected from the second stratum; and 159 jails (out of 436) 
with an ADP of 268 to 999 inmates were selected from the 
third stratum.

* In the 2011 sample, 197 jails (out of 1,489) with an ADP of 
87 or fewer inmates were selected in the first stratum, 120 
jails (out of 773) with an ADP of 88 to 273 inmates were 
selected from the second stratum, and 220 jails (out of 427) 
with an ADP of

During the three years, only one publicly operated jail 
closed prior to data collection (in 2009). Among the 
remaining selected jail jurisdictions in 2009, six did not 
respond to the survey:

* Bessemer City Jail, Bessemer, AL

* Cooke County Justice Center, Gainesville, TX

* Marshall County Jail, Marshalltown, IA

* Oklahoma County Jail, Oklahoma City, OK

* Osage County Jail, Linn, MO

* Roberts County Jail, Sisseton, SD.

Among the 700 jail jurisdictions selected in 2010, 8 did not 
respond to the survey:

* Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office, Portland, ME

* Erie County Holding Center, Buffalo, NY

* Houston County Sheriff’s Office, Dotham, AL

* Morgan County Sheriff’s Office, Decatur, AL

* Pottawatomie County Sheriff’s Office, Shawnee, OK

* Ray County Sheriff’s Office, Henrietta, MO

* St. Louis Department of Public Safety, St. Louis, MO

* Wichita Falls County Sheriff’s Office, Wichita Falls, TX.

Among the 700 selected in 2011, 4 did not respond to the 
survey:

* Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office, Portland, ME

* Ostego County Jail, Gaylord, MI

* Tazewell County Jail, Pekin, IL

Victoria County Jail, Victoria, TX.

**************
Private jails
**************

In each year, a sample of 15 privately operated jails was 
selected based on data reported in the DCRP files. The DCRP 
file listed 41 privately operated jails in 2008, 38 in 2009, 
and 34 in 2010. The facilities on the sampling frame were 
sorted by region, state, and ADP. Based on their large ADP, 
two facilities were selected with certainty in 2009, three in 
2010, and four in 2011. The remaining private jails in each 
year were systematically sampled with probabilities 
proportional to size.

Among the sampled facilities, one had closed prior to data 
collection in 2009 and one had closed in 2010. All selected 
and active privately operated jails in 2009, 2010, and 2011 
participated in the survey.

******************************
Other correctional facilities
******************************

A sample of 15 adult jails in Indian country was selected 
each year. Based on BJS’s Jails in Indian Country collection 
program, jails that held adults only or adults and juveniles 
were eligible for the sampling frame. Jails that held only 
juveniles were included in the juvenile SSV data collection.

Each year the sample was selected through probabilities 
proportionate to size, with ADP as the measure of size. For 
sampling purposes, jails with an ADP of less than one inmate, 
were assigned 1 as their measure of size. Due to their 
relatively large size, two jails were selected with certainty 
in 2009, three in 2010, and three in 2011. There were 63 
adult jails in Indian country in 2009, 61 in 2010, and 59 in 
2011. The remaining jails were sorted by state and ADP and 
then selected with probability proportionate to size.

Of the adult jails selected in Indian country from 2009 
through 2011, one closed prior to data collection:

* Truxton Canyon Adult Detention Center, AZ (closed in 2010). 

Five Indian country jails did not respond to the survey:

* Choctaw Justice Complex Adult Division, MS (2011)

* Fort Peck Police Department and Adult Detention, MT (2009)

* Oglala Sioux Tribal Offenders Facility, SD (2010 and 2011)

* Rosebud Sioux Tribal Police Department and Adult Detention, 
SD (2009)

* Standing Rock Law Enforcement and Adult Detention Center, 
ND (2011).

Two additional censuses of other correctional facilities were 
conducted to represent--

* all facilities operated by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Army, 
U.S. Navy, and the U.S. Marine Corps in the continental 
United States

* all facilities operated by or exclusively for Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were selected. ***Footnote 3 
Based on information from the ICE integrated decision 
support system, 19 facilities were operating in 2009 and 
2010, and 18 facilities in 2011. In 2011, Willacy 
Detention Center, TX, no longer operated as an ICE 
facility.***

All of the facilities under active operation by the U.S. 
military and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 
participated the 2009, 2010, and 2011 surveys.

**********************************
Reports of sexual victimization 
**********************************

Since BJS first developed uniform definitions of sexual 
victimization, correctional administrators have significantly 
enhanced their abilities to report uniform data on sexual 
victimization. In 2011, administrators in 47 state prison 
systems reported allegations of abusive sexual contacts 
separately from nonconsensual sexual acts, an increase of 5 
systems since 2006. One state limited counts of nonconsensual 
sexual acts to completed (versus attempted and completed) 
acts. The majority of state prison systems reported data on 
staff sexual misconduct using survey definitions. Four 
systems were unable to separate staff sexual harassment from 
misconduct, and one system did not track allegations of staff 
sexual harassment in a central database.

Public jail administrators were less likely than prison 
administrators to report sexual victimization based on the 
definitions provided. More than a quarter (27%) of the 695 
public jail jurisdictions selected in 2011 did not record 
abusive sexual contacts separately from the more serious 
nonconsensual sexual acts in 2008. This is an improvement 
over the 2006 SSV, in which a third (36%) of public jail 
jurisdictions did not record this information. Ten public 
jail jurisdictions did not record allegations of abusive 
sexual contacts, 10 based counts of nonconsensual sexual acts 
on completed acts only, and 22 based counts of nonconsensual 
sexual acts on substantiated incidents only. Finally, four 
public jail jurisdictions did not keep records on allegations 
of nonconsensual sexual acts.

Most public jail administrators reported staff sexual 
victimization based on the SSV definitions. However, 19% 
could not separate allegations of staff sexual harassment 
from allegations of staff sexual misconduct. Three did not 
record allegations of staff sexual misconduct, while 19 
recorded substantiated incidents only. Seven did not record 
allegations of staff sexual harassment.
