Traffic Stop Data Collection Policies
for State Police, 1999

At midyear 1999, 9 of the Nation's 49 State law enforcement
agencies whose primary duties include highway patrol reported
requiring officers to record demographic information on the 
diver or passengers for all traffic stops.  Thirty-one State 
State agencies reported collecting specifically racial or 
ethnic data on drivers who receive traffic-related citations.
     
In recent years several States have mandated that State police
collect demographic information on stopped motorists. California
requires that highway patrol officers assigned to drug
interdiction duties record the driver's ethnicity when a stop
occurs.  As of January 2000, State police officers for North
Carolina and Connecticut are required to register demographic
information during all traffic stops.  Other Federal, State, and
local law enforcement agencies are at various stages of
instituting policies to collect data from motorist encounters.  

Demographic information recorded 
from traffic stops 

To better understand practices and policies, the Bureau of
Justice Statistics asked State police agencies about the
information collected from traffic contacts and violations.  Age
and gender were the items most commonly recorded from motorist
stops (table 1).

Race or ethnicity was collected when police officers took the 
following actions during a traffic stop:  

* Written warning  12 State police agencies required that the
driver's race/ethnicity be collected, including 3 States that
collected this information for all passengers.  

* Traffic citation  31 agencies recorded race/ethnicity if
written citations were issued, including 9 that collected these
data for all persons in the stopped vehicle.  

*  Arrest from a traffic stop  37 agencies collected the
arrestee's race/ethnicity, while 17 recorded the race/ethnicity
of all vehicle occupants.

* Search of vehicle or occupants 15 agencies collected the
driver's race/ethnicity if a search was conducted, including 9
that recorded the race/ethnicity of all vehicle occupants.  
Mississippi, New Mexico, and Indiana also collected the driver's
immigration status under these circumstances. 

 * Use-of-force encounter from a traffic stop  32 State agencies
collected the drivers' or passengers' race/ethnicity, including
6 that also gathered immigration status.  

Electronic accessibility of 
demographic records  

Among the 37 State police agencies that collected racial/ ethnic
information on a traffic-related arrest, 23 stored these data
electronically (table 2).

Vermont do not collect demographic data for traffic stops.
Georgia and North Dakota collect age and gender for some traffic stops but not
race/ethnicity.  Hawaii does not have a formal State police agency.

------------------------------------------------------ 

For those 15 States that recorded racial/ethnic information
following a search of the vehicle or occupants, 8 maintained 
these data in electronic form.  About a third of all States
have a driver's racial category on or linked to drivers' 
licenses.  Immigration status is included in driver's 
license files in Florida, Indiana, and Wyoming.
