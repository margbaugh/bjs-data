BJS Statisticians

Included in the wide array of statistics routinely compiled and 
disseminated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) are those 
describing persons sentenced to State prisons during the year. 
Prisoner characteristics are available in two different sources: 
BJS reports that are based on State prison records, and BJS reports 
that use data from State court records.  This report investigates
the extent to which prisoner characteristics from one source match 
those from the other.  Results of the investigation indicate a close
correspondence between court and prison records.

The need for the investigation arises because the court records and 
the prison records are not from geographically identical places.  
For example, in 1992 the prison records are from 37 States, and the 
court records are from a sample of 300 counties scientifically drawn 
to be nationally representative.

State prison records  

Since 1926 the Federal Government has been regularly compiling national
prisoner statistics from records that State prisons voluntarily submit.  
These statistics give information on persons sentenced to State prisons 
during the year:  their age, race, sex, the length of their prison 
sentence, and the offense they committed.  

These statistics serve as one of the Nation's most valuable sources of
information on its prison population.  They answer such questions as 
whether blacks are a growing fraction of the persons being sent to 
prison (they are); whether prison sentences are getting longer 
(generally they are not); and whether imprisonment of violent offenders
accounts for much of the recent increase in the prison population (it 
does). 

State court records  

In 1986 the Federal Government expanded its data gathering to include 
State courts.  The data, voluntarily sent by State courts, serve as 
the sole source of national information on two major roles of courts: 
convicting and sentencing criminals.  The data are from annual records 
that State courts keep on each person convicted of a felony offense.  

The data show how many people are convicted in the year; the crimes 
they are convicted of; their age, race, and sex; and what sentence 
the court imposed.  Among other things, the data reveal that a 
substantial number of the violent offenders convicted in State 
courts each year get probation rather than a prison sentence; that 
about 50% of convicted felons (a category that includes both violent 
and nonviolent criminals) are sentenced to State prison; and that, 
compared to women, men generally receive longer prison sentences, 
longer jail sentences, and longer probation sentences.
   
State court records compared to State prison records

In the State court records, convicted felons who received a prison 
sentence are distinguishable from those who received other sentences. 
Consequently, characteristics of persons sent to prison in a 
particular year according to State court records can be compared to
characteristics of persons who entered prison that same year according 
to State prison records. 

The comparison is instructive.  To the extent that characteristics 
of one match characteristics of the other, confidence is enhanced in 
each as a reliable source of national records on convicted offenders. 
The comparison covers offenders sentenced to State prison in 1992. 
In general, results indicate a close correspondence between the two 
sources.  What State prison records indicate about persons sent to 
prison generally mirrors what State court records show.

Results

Conviction offense  

State prison records and State court records both show that, among 
persons sentenced to State prisons in 1992, robbery was the conviction 
offense for 10% and larceny was for 11% (table 1). Percentages 
differed for most other offenses, but usually by small amounts.

Sex of prisoners 

State prison records and State court records both show that males 
were 91% of the persons sentenced to prison in 1992.  Court records 
show that burglars were 16% of all male offenders sentenced to prison, 
and prison records show 14%, a difference of 2 percentage points 
(table 2).  Differences of this size or less characterized most 
other offenses, for males and females alike (table 2).

Race of prisoners  

Both sources show that, among all persons sentenced to State prisons 
in 1992, 45% were white, 54% were black, and 1% were other races 
(table 1).  Among whites, 7% were persons sentenced for robbery 
according to both prison and court records (table 3).  Among blacks, 
12% were robbers according to court records, nearly identical to 
what prison records show (13%) (table 3). Such small differences 
between court and prison records characterized most offenses.

Age of prisoners 

State prison records and State court records both show that the 
average age of prisoners sentenced in 1992 was 30 years (table 1). 
Nearly a quarter of all persons sentenced in 1992 were between the 
ages of 25 and 29 years.  The percentages that were in other age 
categories generally differed between the two sources, but usually 
by no more than 2 percentage points. 

According to both sets of records the average age of persons 
sentenced for murder in 1992 was 28 (table 4).  For most offense 
categories, State prison records and State court records agreed on
the average age of sentenced persons.  Where differences existed, 
they were usually no more than 1 year.

Prison sentence length

The biggest difference between the two sets of records is prisoner 
sentence length.  Court-recorded sentence lengths averaged 6 months 
longer than prison-recorded sentence lengths.  For example, the 
average prison sentence length for rape was nearly 14 years 8 months
according to court records and 14 years 2 months according to prison 
records (table 5).  Court-recorded sentence lengths were longer than
prison recorded sentence lengths for males, females, whites, and 
blacks (table 6).

The 6-month difference between court records and prison records found 
for 1992 is not found for other years.  In 1990 the court records 
were 3 months longer than the prison records: 6 years 9 months in 
court records versus 6 years 6 months in prison records.  In 1994, 
the prison records were longer than the court records by 2 months: 
6 years 7 months in prison records versus 6 years 5 months in court 
records.

Number of persons sentenced to prison in 1992

Using the most comparable figures, 1992 court records indicate 349,400 
persons were sent to prison with sentences greater than a year; prison 
records indicate 293,200 persons (table 5), difference of 16%.  Nearly 
all of the difference is explained by the fact that 13 States are not
included in the data compiled from prison records.  Had all 50 States 
been included in the prison records, it is estimated that the prison 
records would have indicated 338,600 prison sentences, leaving a 
difference of 4%.

Methodology

Significance  tests

All comparisons discussed in this report were statistically significant 
at the 95% confidence level.  In general, if the difference between two 
numbers is at least twice the standard error of that difference, there 
is at least 95% confidence that the two numbers do in fact differ. 

Data sources

Data for this report were drawn from two BJS statistical programs: the
National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) based on prison records, 
and the National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP) based on court 
records.

Data in this report shown under the heading prison records in 
tables 1 through 4 are from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) 
statistical report National Corrections Reporting Program, 1992 
(NCJ 145862, October 1994, calculated from tables 1-4, 1-5, 1-6,
1-7, 1- 9).  Sentence lengths in tables 5 and 6 under the heading 
prison records were produced specifically for this report based on 
analysis of the 1992 NCRP database.  

Data shown under the heading court records in tables 1 through 6 are 
tabulated from the 1992 NJRP data-base.  For more information on the 
1992 NJRP, see State Court Sentencing of Convicted Felons, 1992, BJS 
Report, NCJ 152696, May 1996.

Average sentence length for 1990 and 1994 were not based on 
previously published figures, but on new analyses of the court 
and prison databases for these years. For published figures and 
more information on 1990 and 1994 data, see National Judicial 
Reporting Program, 1990, BJS Report, NCJ 145323; State Court 
Sentencing of Convicted Felons, 1994, BJS Report, NCJ 164614,
March 1998; National Corrections Reporting Program, 1990, BJS
Report, NCJ 141879; National Corrections Reporting Program, 
1994, BJS Report, forthcoming.

Comparability

Because of numerous differences between procedures used to collect 
NJRP and  NCRP data, the two will not give identical results:

* The NJRP data are based on a sample survey of persons sentenced 
to prison for a felony offense in State courts in 1992.  The sample 
consisted of 300 counties selected to be nationally representative. 

* The NCRP data pertain to persons entering State prison in 1992 
directly from a sentence by a court.  The data were volunteered by 
38 states.  

* NJRP data are limited to persons convicted of a felony, whereas 
NCRP data pertain to all persons entering State prison, whether 
convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor.

The two data sources use similar, but not identical, definitions 
of the term "most serious conviction offense."  For the NCRP, if 
the entering prisoner was convicted of more than one offense, the 
prisoner's "most serious conviction offense" was the offense with 
the longest sentence.  For the NJRP, if the felon was convicted 
of more than one felony offense, the offense designation for the 
felon was the most serious offense.  The hierarchy from most to 
least serious offense was murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault,
burglary, drug trafficking, weapons, forgery/fraud/embezzlement, 
larceny/motor vehicle theft, drug possession, and all other 
felonies.  The hierarchy was determined from an analysis of two 
factors that reflect how seriously the justice system treats 
different offenses:  the sentence length imposed and the time 
actually served in prison before release.  In general, the higher 
the offense is in the hierarchy, the more serious it is in terms 
of the two factors.

Sentence length

Information on average sentence lengths given in tables 5 and 6 of 
this report were not obtained from existing BJS publications of 1992 
data from the NCRP and the NJRP.  The reason is that these 
publications define aver-age sentence length differently:  

* Persons receiving consecutive sentences are treated one way in 
the 1992 NCRP publication's measure of average sentence length and 
a different way in the 1992 NJRP's measure.  In the NJRP publication, 
the sentences for the different offenses are summed.  For example, 
the NJRP measure treats a person receiving a 10-year sentence for 
rape and a consecutive 5-year sentence for robbery as a 15- year 
sentence.  By contrast, the person is treated as a 10-year sentence 
in the NCRP measure because the NCRP measure counts just the longest 
sentence.

* Unlike the 1992 NJRP publication, the 1992 NCRP publication 
does not include probationers and parolees returned to prison with 
new sentences. 

* Unlike the 1992 NJRP publication, the 1992 NCRP publication 
excludes prisoners with sentences of a year or less.

To make average sentence length (shown in tables 5 and 6) more 
comparable between the NCRP and the NJRP, 1992 prison sentence 
length data were subjected to an analysis in which average
sentence length was defined the same way for this report:

* Maximum sentence length for consecutive sentences was defined 
as the sum of the consecutive sentences a person receives.

* Probationers and parolees returned to prison with new sentences
were included.

* Only sentences over a year were included. 

Using a common definition, the NCRP gave an estimated average 
sentence length of 6 years 7 months (table 5) and the NJRP gave 
7 years 1 month (table 5), a difference of 6 months.  When
the common definition was not used, the two differed by 10 months 
(5 years 7 months according to the 1992 NCRP publication versus 6 
years 7 months according to the 1992 NJRP publication).  Therefore, 
using a common definition (table 5) narrowed the difference.
 
Even with the use of a common definition, differences remain 
between the NCRP and the NJRP.  For example, California (which 
has relatively short sentences) accounts for a greater fraction 
of the NCRP cases than the NJRP cases.  The 6-month difference 
(table 5) between the NCRP and the NJRP would be reduced to 4 
months if California accounted for the same fraction of the
NCRP as the NJRP.  No doubt other differences exist between the 
two that affect comparisons of average sentence length.

Estimate of the number of persons sentenced to prison in 1992 
according to prisoner data 

The 293,162 figure for the 37 States plus an estimate for the 
13 missing States forms a national estimate of persons admitted. 
To obtain the national estimate, a prisoner database was located
that gave an aggregate count of the number of persons sentenced 
to prison in 1992 for each of the 50 States (Correctional 
Populations in the United States, 1992 , NCJ 146413, January 
1995, tables 5.10a, 5.16 ).  According to the database, the 13 
States accounted for 12% of prison admissions nationwide in 1992.  
Using the 12% figure as a basis for estimation, it is estimated 
that 338,000 persons were sentenced to prison nationwide in 1992.
