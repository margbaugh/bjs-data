Highlights

An estimated 5.5 million adult residents  of the United States
were under some form of correctional supervision in 1996.  Seven
in every ten of these people were on probation or parole.  

About 2.8% of all adult residents of the United States were
under correctional supervision in 1996, up from 1.6% in 1985. 
About 9.0% of black adults, 2.0% of white adults, and 1.3% of
adults of other races were under correctional supervision in
1996.

Jails 

On June 30,1996, local jails held an estimated 510,400 adults,
or about 1 in every 378 adult U.S. residents.

Men comprised 89% of adult jail inmates.  White non-Hispanic
inmates accounted for 42% of the total jail population; black
non-Hispanics, 41%; and Hispanics, 16%.

The total number of adults in local jails increased by an
estimated 11,100 during the year ending June 30, 1996, or 2.2%.
Between 1986 and 1996 the adult jail population rose by 237,700,
an average annual increase of  6.5%.

Probation 

Nearly 3.2 million adults were on probation on December 31,1996.
Probationers made up 57% of all adults under
correctionalsupervision in 1996, down from 58% in 1995, and 65%
in 1986.

Twenty-one percent of the probationers were women, a larger
proportion than for any other correctional population.  About
66% were white and 32%, black. 

About 65% of all adults discharged from probation in 1996 had
successfully completed their sentences.

Between yearend 1995 and 1996, the number of adults on probation
increased  by 83,834 (2.7%).  From 1986 to 1996 the probation
population grew by more than  1.1 million, an average of 4.2%
annually.

Prisons

An estimated 1.1 million men and women were in the custody of
State and Federal prisons at yearend 1996.  Approximately 

94% were men.  About 48% of the inmates were white, 49% black,
and 3% American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific
Islander. 

The number of State and Federal inmates rose by 54,237 (5%)
during 1996.  This gain brought the total increase in prisoner

population between 1986 and 1996 to 654,088, which translates to
an average annual growth rate of 8.4%.

The number of sentenced prisoners under State or Federal
jurisdiction per 100,000 U.S. residents increased 45% from 292
in 1990 to 422 in 1996.  

Between 1990 and 1996 the imprisonment rate of white inmates
rose 39% from 139 to 193 per 100,000; the rate for blacks
increased 38% from 1,067 to 1,571; and the rate for Hispanics
grew  26% from 548 to 688.

Among whites, prisoners age 30-34 had the highest incarceration
rate in 1996:  469 per 100,000 white residents.  Among blacks,
prisoners age 25-29 had the highest rate: 4,131 per 100,000. 
Among Hispanics, prisoners age 20-24 had the highest rate: 
1,514.

Approximately 64% of sentenced prisoners entering prison in 1996
were new court commitments, and a third were parole or other
conditional release violators.

Among State prisoners entering prison for the first time for a
given offense, the proportion who were black declined from 51%
in 1990 to 47% in 1996, and the proportion white increased from
49% to 52%.  The opposite was true among Federal new court
commitments:  Whites decreased from 66% in 1990 to 62% in 1996,
while blacks increased  from 32% to 34%.

In 1996, for the third consecutive year, the number of persons
admitted to State prisons for drug offenses (98,700) exceeded
the number entering for violent (96,300), property (94,800), or
public-order crimes (34,600).  However, 1996 was the first year
that violent admissions exceeded property admissions. 

Parole and post-release supervision

An estimated 704,700 adults were on parole at yearend 1996, an
increase of 0.6% from 1995 . Among persons released from 
prison in 1996, 73% were placed on probation, parole, or some 
other type of conditional release.

The number of persons leaving State prisons based on parole
board decisions declined from 37% in 1990 to 30% in 1996. 
During the same period, the number departing as mandatory
releases grew from 29% to 38%, and as expiration of sentence, from 13% to 17%.

Slightly fewer than 9 in every 10 parolees were men.  An
estimated 54% of persons on parole were white; 44%, black; and 2% of other
races.

Nearly half of all exits from parole werecategorized as
successful completions.  The majority of the remainder were
returned to incarceration, but only about 1 in every 8 parolees
were returned to incarceration with a new sentence.

Although the parole population increased by less than 1% during
1996, the average annual rate of increase from 1986 to 1996 was
8.0%.  The number of adults on parole rose 116% during the
10-year period.

The proportion of  adults being actively supervised (79%) and
those being supervised out-of-State (4%) declined slightly
between 1986 and 1996, whereas the relative number under
inactive supervision (10%) increased slightly, and persons
classified as absconders remained about the same (7%).

Capital punishment

During 1996, 299 inmates were received under sentence of death
by State and Federal prisons, and 99 had their death sentences
removed by means other than execution. 

As of December 31, 1996, the Nation's prisons held a total of
3,219 inmates under sentence of death.  An estimated 57% were
white and 42% were black.  Half had been under sentence of death
for at least  6 years and 3 months.

Nineteen States executed 45 male prisoners during 1996,
including 31 whites and 14 blacks.  Between 1977 and 1996 a
total of 358 prisoners were executed under civil authority in
the United States. 

Military confinement 

On December 31, 1996, the Army, Marine Corps, and Navy held a
total of 2,747 prisoners in 28 facilities.  The Coast Guard
operated no confinement facilities.  Data  for Air Force
facilities were not reported.

Approximately 99% of the prisoners held by the Army, 82% of
those held by the Navy, and 70% of those held by the MarineCorps
at yearend 1996 were convicted inmates; the remainder were
unconvicted persons whose cases had not yet been tried.   

About a third of convicted military prisoners were confined for
rape (16%) or sexual assault (15%).  Slightly less than a fifth
were serving sentences for drugs.  Twelve percent were sentenced
for larceny/theft,  and 11% for murder.  Approximately 9% were
confined for military infractions, such as AWOL,
insubordination, or failure to obey a lawful order.

Ninety-eight percent of all prisoners held in military
confinement facilities in 1996 were men, and 2% were women. 
About 52% were non-Hispanic whites; 36%, non-Hispanic blacks;
8%, Hispanics; and 4% other races.  Slightly more than 98% were
enlisted personnel, and slightly less than 2% were officers.

1996 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails

The 1996 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (SILJ) conducted
face-to-face interviews with jail inmates from October 1995
through March 1996. 

The Survey obtained detailed information about jail inmates'
current offenses and sentences, their criminal
histories,personal and family characteristics, drug alcohol use
and treatment, and health care and  jail condition issues.  Jail
inmate surveys were also conducted in 1972, 1978, 1983, and
1989. 

During the period that  interviews were conducted for the SILJ,
approximately 3,328 local jails held an estimated
507,026inmates.  Between the fall of 1989, when the previous
survey was conducted, and 1996 the jail population grew 28%.

Although jail inmates were predominantly male, women accounted
for an increasing percentage of the total.  The percentage of 
black and Hispanic jail inmates in 1996 had not changed
substantially from 1989 after increasing between 1983 and 1989. 

The rapid increase in the percentage of jail inmates held for a
drug offense during the 1980's abated in the 1990's.  The
percentage charged with a drug offense rose from 9% in 1983 to
23% in 1989 but remained at 22% in 1996.

The percentage of inmates in jail for a violent offense rose
slightly, from 23% in 1989 to 26% in 1996.  In both years just
under a 25% of the inmates were charged with a public-order
offense, 7% to 9% were being held for driving while intoxicated
(DWI), and 2% for a weapons violation.

The most common offense among white jail inmates was driving
while intoxicated (DWI) or driving under the influence (DUI) .
An estimated 13% of white inmates, 7% of Hispanics, and 2% of 
blacks were in jail  for DWI/DUI.  

Violent offenses were most frequent among younger inmates. 
Almost a third of those 24 or younger, but a fourth of those 25
or older, were in jail for a violent offense.  

Almost 1 in every 3 jail inmates were on probation at the time
of their most recent arrest; 1 in 8 were on parole; and 1 in 8
were on bail or prerelease bond.  

The percentage of recidivists -- those with a prior sentence to
probation or incarceration as an adult or juvenile -- declined
from 77% in 1989 to 73% in 1996.  

The criminal records of jail inmates in 1996 were longer than
those of inmates in 1989.  About 32% of all inmates in 1996,
compared to 23% in 1989, said they had served three or more
terms in jail, prison,  or other correctional facility.

Reported drug use by jail inmates rose sharply between 1989 and
1996.  The percentage of inmates who said they had ever used
marijuana rose from 71% to 78%; stimulants from 22% to 34%;
hallucinogens from 24% to 32%; depressants without a doctor's
prescription, from 21%  to 30%; and heroin or other opiates from
19% to 24%.

Before their most recent admission to jail, 37% of female
inmates, compared to 11% of males, said they had been physically
abused.  Thirty-seven percent of the women, compared to 6% of
men, reported they had been sexually abused.  About 27% of women
and 3% of men had  ever been raped.

Important note

Correctional Populations in the United States presents numbers
that describe persons under some form of correctional
supervision.  In this compilation the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) seeks to help users by making readily apparent 
the links between different correctional institutions or methods in each State
suggesting the similarities and differences between States and
regions as our system of criminal justice responds to both
common and disparate needs permitting comparisons, however
limited they must be, with previous years' statistics. 

Helping readers find a single number

Through an index at the end of the volume, readers can find all
topics treated in the tables.  The index numbers refer to the
tables.

Footnotes give extra information about how to interpret the
numbers in the tables.

Category definitions are available in three places:  the
explanatory notes in the appendices of sections, the
questionnaires also in the appendices, and the definitions of
common terms in the Introduction on page 2. 

To make comparisons across years or between jurisdictions 

BJS makes every effort to report numbers that are consistent in
interpretation with those of the past and between separate
jurisdictions in the present.  Data collection rules and
reporting protocols that fit historical statistics and that
impose the least burden on respondents are used.

Some jurisdictions depart from the reporting conventions, and
some categories for counting have shifted over the years.  Users
who try to draw conclusions from such numbers by comparing years
or jurisdictions must take into account special circumstances
and changes.  Footnotes, table notes, explanatory notes, and
other material highlighting the tables must be consulted for a
full understanding of the data.

The following symbols are used in the tables:

  /  not reported
  :  not known
...  not applicable
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Definitions of common terms used in tables

Custody.  To have custody of a prisoner, a State must hold that
person in one of its facilities.  Early statistical reports gave
custody counts that largely have been replaced by jurisdiction
counts of State prison populations.  A State may have custody of
a prisoner over whom another State maintains jurisdiction.  The
tables present both kinds of counting procedures, with
jurisdiction counts being more complete; States reporting only
on custody are noted.

Detention status.  This term distinguishes between prisoners,
usually in jail, who were convicted or awaiting judgment.

Discretionary parole.  A release from prison to supervision is
discretionary when it is decided by a board or other authority.

Hispanic origin.  A person of Hispanic origin may be of any
race; however, a few States treat the ethnic category as a
racial one.

Jurisdiction.  Jurisdiction refers to a unit of government or to
the legal authority to exercise governmental power.  According
to the latter meaning, the prisoners under a State's
jurisdiction may be in the custody of local jails.  (See
"Custody.")

Mandatory parole.  Mandatory parole results from statutory or
correctional guidelines, and no judgment by a panel or board is
required for release of a prisoner to supervision outside prison.

Maximum sentence length.  Some jurisdictions sentence offenders
to a range of years; the larger number in that range is the most
that a prisoner may serve on a sentence.  Often, good time is
subtracted from the maximum sentence.  When the tables report on
prisoners with sentences longer or shorter than a year, the
maximum sentence is used where applicable.

Military justice terms  --

General court-martial is the highest military court for judging
the most serious offenses.  A military judge presides.  This
court  includes members (jurors) at the election of the accused,
except when the court must have members for imposition of the
death penalty.  If an enlisted person is accused, in the absence
of exigent circumstances at least a third of the court must be
enlisted members who are not lower ranking than the accused.  A
general court-martial may be used to try any person subject to
the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 

Special court-martial is used for judging offenses less serious
than those in a general court-martial.  A military judge
presides.  A special court-martial may not impose the following:
 the death penalty,  a dishonorable discharge, dismissal of an
officer, confinement in excess of 6 months, hard labor without
confinement for more than 3 months, forfeiture of pay in excess
of two-thirds of pay per month, or forfeiture of any percentage
of  pay for more than  6 months.

Summary court-martial is the least formal military court,
consisting of one active-duty commissioned officer.  This court
promptly adjudicates minor offenses under a simple procedure. 
Punishment may not exceed confinement for 1 month, hard labor
without confinement for 45 days, restriction to specified limits
for more than 2 months, or forfeiture of more than two-thirds
pay for more than 1 month.  If the service member is above the
rank of E-4, the presiding officer may not impose confinement,
hard labor without confinement, or reduction of more than one
grade.  

Movement.  In corrections, a movement is an admission to or a
release from a status such as prisoner, parolee, or probationer.
Unless specifically noted, a transfer between facilities does
not count as a movement.

Most serious offense.  The offense with the longest term of
incarceration imposed.

New court commitments.  Inmates who were admitted to prison
directly from a court with all new sentences.  This category
includes probation violators entering prison for the first time
on the probated offenses.  Parole violators are excluded from
this category.

One-day count.  For a 1-day count a jurisdiction or facility is
asked to report how many people were on its roll on a certain
day.  The average daily population is a year's total number of
people on the roll each day, divided by the number of days.  The
methods of counting in aggregate do not yield estimates of
either the number of persons in a status during the year or the
average amount of time persons remain in a status.

Parole.  Unless otherwise specified, parole includes all types
of supervision in the community in which the period of community
supervision was affixed at  the time of release from a prison or
jail.  Includes discretionary parole, mandatory parole, and
other forms of post-release supervision. Excludes persons
initially sentenced to incarceration followed by a period of
probation, often referred to as a "split sentence."

Race.  Classification by race often depends on the reporting
program and the State.  A few States reported two categories: 
white and nonwhite.  A few others categorized Hispanic offenders
as belonging to "Other race."  The number of persons with
certain racial backgrounds were sometimes estimated.

Reporting time.  The prison and capital punishment figures are
from December 31, 1996, unless otherwise noted.  The Bureau of
the Census surveyed jails on June 30, 1996. The bureau conducted
the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails from October 1995 through
March 1996.

Revisions.  Many States revise the yearend number reported for
the previous year.  Those revisions are made in the total, not
the detail.  For example, the number of blacks, whites, and
members of other races for 1995 were not changed by a State in
1996 to equal its revised 1995 total.
