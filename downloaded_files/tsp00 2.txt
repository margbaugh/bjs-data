Highlights

State parole population has remained
stable since 1992

*  After more than a decade of rapid 
growth, the number of adults under
State parole supervision has nearly
stabilized -- increasing by 33,510 
(0.7% per year) since 1992.

*  During the 1980's, entries to State
parole supervision tripled, growing from
around 113,000 to 349,000 in 1990. 
During the 1990's, parole en- tries
continued to rise (up 2.4% per year), but
were offset by an increase in parole
discharges (up 4.6% a year).

Since 1990 mandatory parole releases
have increased, while discretionary
releases have decreased

*  Between 1990 and 1999, the number
of discretionary parole releases from
prison dropped (from 159,731 to 128,708), 
while the number of mandatory parole 
releases nearly doubled (from 116,857 to 
223,342). 

*  In 1999, nearly 100,000 inmates
released from State prisons served their
entire prison term (18%), up from 51,288
(13%) in 1990.

42% of parole discharges in 1999
successfully completed supervision

*  Among State parole discharges in
1999, over half of discretionary parolees
successfully completed their term of
supervision, compared to a third of
mandatory parolees.

*  Success rates were higher among
parole discharges who were first prison
releases (63%), age 55 or older (54%),
and female (48%), than among those
who were re-releases (21%), under age
25 (36%), and male (39%).
------------------------------------------------------------

By the end of 2000, 16 States had
abolished discretionary release from
prison by a parole board for all offenders.  
Another five States had abolished 
discretionary parole for certain violent 
offenses or other crimes against a person.  
As a result of the movement away from 
release by parole boards (discretionary 
parole), release determined by statute 
(mandatory parole) became the most common
method of release from State prison. 
After 1990 mandatory parole increased
from 29% of releases to 41% in 1999, 
while discretionary parole decreased 
from 39% to 24%.

Despite changes in release policies,
652,199 adults were under State parole
supervision at yearend 2000, more than
a 3-fold increase since 1980, when
196,786 adults were on parole.  About
312 adults per 100,000 adult U.S.
residents were under parole supervision
in 2000, compared to 121 in 1980 and
271 in 1990.  While the average annual
rate of growth in State parole from 1980
to 2000 was 6.2%, the largest increase
occurred between 1980 and 1992, when
the number of adults on parole grew
10% annually.  After 1992 growth in the
number of adults on State parole slowed, 
increasing at an average annual rate of 
0.7%.

This report focuses on trends in the
State parole population after 1990, the
effect of sentencing policies on community 
release, and the implications for success 
or failure of offenders under community 
supervision.  

--------------------------------------
Parole defined

Parole -- a period of conditional
supervised release following a prison
term.  Prisoners may be released to
parole either by a parole board decision
(discretionary parole) or according to
provisions of a statute (mandatory
parole).

Discretionary parole -- parole boards
have discretionary authority to
conditionally release prisoners based 
on a statutory or administrative
determination of eligibility.

Mandatory parole -- generally occurs in
jurisdictions using determinate sentencing 
statutes.  Inmates are conditionally 
released from prison after serving a portion 
of their original sentence minus any good 
time earned.

Data sources

National Corrections Reporting Program
(NCRP) -- collects individual inmate
records for prison admissions and
releases and parole admissions and
discharges.

Annual Parole Survey (APS) -- provides a 
count of the total number of persons under 
parole supervision on January 1 and December 
31, and a count of the number entering and 
leaving supervision during each year.

National Prisoner Statistics (NPS-1) --
provides yearend jurisdiction-level data
on the number of prisoners in State and
Federal correctional facilities and the
number of parole violators returned to
prison during each year.

Survey of Inmates in State Adult Correctional 
Facilities  -- provides self-reported data 
on individual characteristics of State inmates 
admitted to prison while under parole supervi-
sion and on characteristics of soon to be 
released inmates.
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
States have reduced the discretion of parole 
boards in determining prison release

From 1990 to 2000, the State parole
population grew at a slower rate than 
the State prison population.  During this 
period, parolees increased 30%, compared 
to a 75% increase for State prisoners. On 
average, the parole population increased 
2.6% per year, while the prison population 
rose 5.7% per year.  The low rate of growth 
in parole supervision reflects changes in
sentencing and parole release policies
that have resulted in increasing lengths
of stay in prison and declining prison
release rates.  (See Prisoners in 1999,
August 2000, NCJ 183476.) 

Historically, most State inmates were
released to parole supervision after
serving a portion of an indeterminate
sentence based on a parole board decision.  
(See box on this page for definitions.)  
In 1977, 69% of offenders released from 
State prison were released by a parole 
board.  In 44 States and the District of 
Columbia, parole boards were responsible 
for the majority of prison releases. In 
other States most inmates were released 
through expiration of sentence (Louisiana, 
Missouri, and Wyoming), to probation (Idaho), 
or to mandatory parole (Alaska and Arizona). 

States began moving away from discretionary 
release policies in the 1980's in favor of 
determinate sentences and mandatory supervised 
release.  By 1989 seven States had abolished
discretionary parole.  In 20 States the
majority of prison releases were through
expiration of sentence or mandatory
parole release.  As a percentage of all
State prison releases, discretionary
parole releases decreased from 55% in
1980 to 38% in 1989, while mandatory
parole releases increased from 19% to
30%.

Continuing the shift away from release
by a parole board, an additional eight
States abolished discretionary parole in
the 1990's.  Most of the remaining States 
further restricted parole by setting 
specific standards offenders must meet to 
be eligible for release.

-----------------------------------------------

By yearend 2000, 29 States and the
District of Columbia had adopted the
Federal truth-in-sentencing standard 
that requires Part 1 violent offenders 
to serve not less than 85% of their
sentence in prison before becoming
eligible for release.  Part 1 violent
offenses, as defined by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation's Uniform 
Crime Reports, include murder,
nonnegligent manslaughter, rape,
robbery, and aggravated assault.  By
adopting this standard, States could
receive truth-in-sentencing funds under
the Violent Offender Incarceration and
Truth-in-Sentencing (VOITIS) incentive
grant program as established by the
1994 Crime Act. VOITIS grants can be
used by States to build or expand prison
capacity.

Five States (Delaware, Minnesota, 
Tennessee, Utah, and Washington) enacted 
truth-in-sentencing laws prior to passage 
of the Crime Act.  The remaining States 
passed truth-in-sentencing laws after 1994. 
(See Truth in Sentencing in State
Prisons, January 1999, NCJ 170032.)

At yearend 2000 nearly three-quarters of
the parole population was in the District
of Columbia and the 29 States that met
the Federal 85%-standard.  Nine of the
ten States with the largest parole
populations in 2000 met the Federal
truth-in-sentencing standard for violent
offenders.  Texas, with the second
largest parole population, required
violent offenders to serve 50% of their
sentence. 

Overall, 11 States more than doubled
their parole populations from 1990 to
2000; 6 of the 11 were Federal truth-
in-sentencing States.  In absolute
numbers, 6 Federal truth-in-sentencing
States (California, Illinois, Louisiana,
New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania) had
an increase of 11,000 or more parolees. 
Thirteen States (9 of which were Federal
truth-in-sentencing States) experienced
a decline of at least 10% during this
period. 

Four States accounted for nearly
two-thirds of the growth in parole
during the 1990's

Four States (California, New York,
Pennsylvania, and Texas) supervised
over half of all State parolees at 
yearend 2000.  Together, these States 
accounted for 64% of the growth in State 
parole from 1990 to 2000. 

Sixteen States experienced a decline in
their parole populations.  Washington
State (down 98%), followed by North
Carolina (down 68%) and Mississippi
(down 52%), had the largest declines, 
as the result of abolishing discretionary
parole.  

At yearend 2000 nearly 1 in every 320
adults were under State parole supervision.  
Overall, there were 312 parolees per 
100,000 adult U.S. residents in 2000, up 
from 271 per 100,000 residents in 1990. 

Among States, Pennsylvania (with 876
parolees per 100,000 State residents),
Texas (with 747), and Louisiana (with
704) had the highest rates of parole
supervision.  Excluding Maine and
Washington, which abolished parole 
in 1975 and 1984, respectively, North
Dakota had the lowest rate of parole
supervision (24 per 100,000 State
residents), followed by Nebraska 
(with 38), Rhode Island (with 44),  
and Florida (with 49).

Since 1990 discretionary releases
have declined; mandatory parole 
and expiration of sentence releases
have increased

Regardless of their method of release,
nearly all State prisoners (at least 95%)
will be released from prison at some
point; nearly 80% will be released to
parole supervision.  (See Prisoners in
1998, August 1999, NCJ 175687.) As a 
percentage of all releases, mandatory 
parole releases increased from 29% in 
1990 to 41% in 1999. Discretionary parole 
releases dropped from 39% to 24%, while 
releases due to expiration of sentence rose 
from 13% to 18%.

In the 1980's discretionary parole was
the primary method of release from
State prison.  Between 1985 and 1990
discretionary parole releases increased
from 88,069 to 159,731.  The number
released by State parole boards peaked
in 1992 (at 170,095) and declined each
year thereafter, dropping to 128,708 in
1999.  

Consistent with the adoption of truth in
sentencing and other mandatory release
statutes, mandatory parole releases have 
steadily increased, from 26,735 in
1980 to 116,857 in 1990.  By 1995 the 
number of mandatory releases exceeded 
the number of discretionary releases.  
In 1999, 223,342 State prisoners were
released by mandatory parole, a 91%-
increase from 1990. 

Growth in prison releases linked to
drug offenders

Overall, the number of prison releases
rose from 405,374 in 1990 to 542,950 in
1999.  Based on the most serious offense 
for which prisoners had served time, drug 
offenders comprised an increasing percentage 
of prison releases.  Nearly 33% of State 
prison releases in 1999 were drug offenders
(up from 26% in 1990 and 11% in 1985). 
The number of drug offenders released
rose from 23,000 in 1985 to 105,800 in
1990. After 1990 the number of drug
offenders continued to go up, reaching
177,000 in 1999.

As a percentage of all releases from
prison, violent offenders have remained
stable, while property offenders have
dropped sharply.  Nearly 25% of releases 
were violent offenders in 1999 (down from 
26% in 1990), and 31% were property 
offenders (down from 39%).

Between 1990 and 1999, annual releases 
from State prison to parole supervision 
grew by an estimated 78,900 inmates. Drug 
offenders accounted for 61% of the increase,
followed by violent offenders (23%), and 
public-order offenders (15%). The number 
of property offenders released to parole 
declined from 1990 to 1999.  

About 98,000 State prisoners were released 
unconditionally through an expiration of 
their sentence in 1999, up from 48,971 
released in 1990. These inmates were released 
without any parole supervision.  Of those
released in 1999, 32% were violent offenders, 
32% property offenders, 24% drug offenders, 
and 12% public-order offenders.

Prison releases have served more 
time and a greater portion of their 
sentence before release

Among all State inmates released from
prison for their first time on their 
current offense ("first releases"), the 
average time served in prison increased 
from 22 months in 1990 to 29 months in 
1999. Released inmates had also served 
an average of 5 months in local jails 
prior to their admission to prison.  
Overall, released inmates had served a 
total of 34 months in 1999 -- 6 months 
longer than released inmates in 1990.

Murderers released in 1999 served on
average 14 months longer than those
released in 1990 (106 months versus 
92 months).  Rape offenders served 17
months longer (79 months compared to
62 months).  Drug offenders served 27
months in 1999, compared to 20 months
in 1990.

Reflecting statutory and policy changes
that required offenders to serve a larger
portion of their sentence before release,
all offenders released for the first time 
in 1999 served on average 49% of their
sentence, up from 38% in 1990.  

Of the four major offense categories,
violent offenders served the highest
percentage (55%) in 1999, followed by
public-order (51%), property (46%), and
drug offenders (43%). Offenders convicted 
of assault served the highest percentage 
of their sentence (about 59%), followed 
by offenders convicted of rape (58%).

Time served by released Part 1
violent offenders increased in 33
States between 1993 and 1999

Through the VOITIS program, 33 States
reported an increase in average time
served by released Part 1 violent
prisoners between 1993 and 1999.  Overall, 
time served by released Part 1 violent 
offenders rose from 46 months to 53 months.  
The average time served for violent of-
fenders released in 1999 ranged from 29 
months in North Dakota to 85 months in 
Missouri.  

The percent of the total sentence served
increased from 46% in 1993 to 56% in
1999.  Part 1 violent offenders in
Missouri (86%), Arizona (81%), and
Connecticut (80%) served the highest
percent of their sentences before
release.  Violent offenders in Utah and
Arkansas served the lowest percent of
their sentences before release (36%).

On average, in 1999 released violent
offenders in Federal truth-in-sentencing
States served 50 months (or 58% of the
average maximum sentence), while violent 
offenders in other States served 55 months 
(54% of the maximum sentence).  Between 
1993 and 1999, the percent of sentence 
served by released violent inmates rose 
in 21 of the 25 truth-in-sentencing States 
that reported data and in 12 of the 21 
States not meeting the 85%-standard. 

Inmates released by parole boards
served longer than those released 
by mandatory parole

In 1999 prisoners released by discretionary 
parole for the first time on the current 
sentence had served an average of 35 months 
in prison and jail, while those released 
through mandatory parole had served 33 
months. Among discretionary releases, time 
served rose for all types of offenders 
during the 1990's.  In 1999 violent of-
fenders released by discretionary parole 
served 10 months longer than violent 
offenders released in 1990; property 
offenders served 6 months longer; drug 
offenders, 8 months; and public-order 
offenders, 3 months.

Among mandatory parole releases, time
served also increased for all types of
offenses -- violent and public-order
offenders served 6 months longer in
1999 than in 1990, while property and
drug offenders served 7 months longer.

Although the average time served by
discretionary releases exceeded the 
time served by mandatory parole releases 
in both years, discretionary releases 
served a smaller percentage of their 
prison sentences before release. In 
1999 discretionary releases served
37% of their total prison sentence (up
from 34% in 1990); mandatory releases
served 61% of their sentence (up from
55%).

Prisoners released due to expiration of
sentence had served longer in 1999 (36
months) than in 1990 (31 months). Violent 
offenders released through expiration of 
sentence had the largest increase (8 
months) in time served in prison.  In 
1999 violent offenders released through 
expiration of sentence served, on average, 
68%  of their total maximum sentence, up 
from 53% in 1990. 

Among discretionary and mandatory
parole releases, black offenders
served longer than whites
  
Time served by prisoners released for
the first time on their current sentence 
in 1999 varied among white, black, and
Hispanic prisoners.  Overall, black
non-Hispanic offenders released by
discretionary parole in 1999 served 37
months; white non-Hispanics served 34
months; and Hispanics 33 months. Black 
offenders released by mandatory parole 
served 7 months longer than whites (38 
months compared to 31 months). Hispanics 
served 30 months.

Among released violent offenders, blacks 
served 4 months longer than whites before 
a discretionary parole release (62 months 
compared to 58 months) and 6 months 
longer before a mandatory parole (53 months 
compared to 47 months).  Hispanic prisoners
served the shortest amount of time for
violent offenses before release (47 months 
before a discretionary parole release and 
41 months before a mandatory release). 

In 1999 Hispanics served longer than
other groups for drug offenses before a
discretionary parole release (31 months
versus 27 for whites and 28 for blacks). 
Black drug offenders served more time
before a mandatory release (31 months), 
than whites (22 months) and Hispanics 
(26 months). 

Women released in 1999 served less time 
in State prison than men, regardless 
of the method of release.  On average, 
women released by discretionary parole 
served 26 months, and men served 36 months.  
Women released by mandatory parole served 
24 months and men served 34 months.

For violent offenses, women served 45
months prior to discretionary release
compared to 36 months among women who 
received a mandatory parole. Women in 
prison for drug offenses served 24 months 
before a discretionary release and 21 
months before a mandatory release.

Over half of prison releases had a
prior incarceration; more than a
quarter were parole violators

A majority of released State prisoners
had been in prison before and were
returned to prison for new offenses or
parole violations.  According to inmates
in State prison in 1997, 56% of those
who expected to be released to the
community by yearend 1999 had one or
more prior incarcerations, and 25% had
3 or more prior incarcerations.  Among
those expecting to return to the community 
by 1999, 27% had been on parole and 26% 
on probation at the time of arrest for 
their current incarceration.  

These criminal records were compounded 
by histories of drug and alcohol abuse, 
mental illness, and homelessness. Among 
prisoners expected to be released to the 
community by yearend 1999, 84% reported 
being involved in drugs or alcohol at the 
time of the offense. Nearly 25% were 
determined to be alcohol dependent, and 
21% had committed the offense to obtain 
money for drugs. Fourteen percent were 
determined to be mentally ill, and 12% 
reported being homeless at the time of 
arrest. 

State parole entries and discharges
rose during the 1990's

During 2000 there were 441,605 entries
to State parole, a 27% increase over the
number that entered parole in 1990. The 
number of discharges from State parole 
rose from 274,697 in 1990 to 432,183 in 
2000, an increase of 57%. During the 1990's, 
State parole entries increased an average 
of  2.4% per year, while parole discharges 
increased an average of 4.6% per year.

Discharges include parolees who are 
successful as well as those who are
unsuccessful (including revocations,
returns to prison or jail, and absconders).  
Discharges also include parolees 
transferred to other jurisdictions and 
those who die while under supervision.

Re-releases an increasing portion 
of State parole entries

Among parole entries, the percentage
who had been re-released rose between
1990 and 1999.  Re-releases are persons 
leaving prison after having served time 
either for a violation of parole or other 
conditional release or for a new offense 
committed while under parole supervision.  
In 1990, 27% of entries to parole were 
re-releases; in 1999, 45% were re-
releases.  During 1999 an estimated 192,
400 re-releases entered parole, an 
increase of 103% over the 94,900 re-
releases in 1990. 

After having been returned to prison 
for a parole or conditional release
violation, re-releases served on average
13 months in prison in 1999.  From 1990
to 1999 their average time served in
prison following re-admission increased
by 2 months.  In both years about 7 in
10 re-releases had served less than 12
months in prison.

State parole entries older in 1999 
than in 1990

The average age of prisoners released
to parole increased from 31 years in
1990 to 34 years in 1999.  In 1999 an
estimated 109,300 State prisoners age
40 or older were paroled, -- 26% of all
entries to parole.  This was more than
double the 47,800 prisoners age 40 or
older who entered parole in 1990.

The number of parole entries among inmates 
under age 35 declined over the period.  In 
1999, 233,500 State prisoners under age 35 
entered parole, down from 252,700.  The 
largest decline was among inmates age 25 
to 29. In 1990 they represented 27% of all 
parole entries; in 1999, 19%.

Female entries to parole increased
during the 1990's

In 1999, 10% of entries to State parole
were female, up from 8% in 1990.  The
number of women who entered parole
increased from an estimated 27,600 in
1990 to 42,000 in 1999.  Although the
52% increase in the number of female
parole entries outpaced that of males
(up 19%), there were 381,900 male
entries in 1999. 

An increasing percentage of women entering 
parole had served time for drug offenses.  
In 1990, 36% of female parole entries were 
drug offenders; by 1999, 42% were drug of-
fenders. Women first released to parole 
were less likely to be property offenders 
in 1999 (35%) than in 1990 (42%).  As a 
percentage of women entering parole, 
violent offenders remained unchanged (16%).

Among parole entries, the racial and
ethnic distributions remained nearly
stable during the 1990's.  In 1999, 35%
of parole entries were white, 47% were
black, and 16% were Hispanic.  Violent
offenders accounted for approximately a
quarter of first releases among whites,
blacks, and Hispanics in both 1990 and
1999.

Drug offenders represented an increasing 
percentage of parole entries, among all 
groups.  In 1999 drug offenders comprised 
39% of black parole entries (up from 31% 
in 1990); 43% of Hispanic entries (up from 
41%); and 21% of white entries (up from 
18%).

Parole success rates unchanged
since 1990

Of the 410,613 discharges from State parole 
in 1999, 42% successfully completed their 
term of supervision, 43% were returned to 
prison or jail, and 10% absconded. In 1990, 
45% of State parole discharges were success-
ful.  Between 1990 and 1999 the percent 
successful among State parole discharges 
has ranged from 42% to 49%, without any 
distinct trend.

States differed in their rate of success
among parole discharges.  States with
the highest rates of success in 1999
were Massachusetts and Mississippi (at
83% each),  followed by North Carolina
(80%) and North Dakota (79%). Utah (18%) 
and California (21%) had the lowest rates 
of success in 1999.

When comparing State success rates for
parole discharges, differences may be
due to variations in parole populations,
such as age at prison release, criminal
history, and most serious offense. 
Success rates may also differ based on
the intensity of supervision and the
parole agency policies related to
revocation of technical violators.  

Success rates highest among first
releases and discretionary parole
releases

In every year during the 1990's, first
releases to State parole were more likely
to have been successful than re-releases.  
Among State parole discharges in 1990, 56% 
of first releases successfully completed 
their supervision, compared to 15% of
re-releases.  Of all those exiting parole
in 1999, 63% of first releases were
successful, compared to 21% of
re-releases. 

Success rates also varied by method of
release.  In every year between 1990
and 1999, State prisoners released by a
parole board had higher success rates
than those released through mandatory
parole.  Among parole discharges in
1999, 54% of discretionary parolees were 
successful compared to 33% of those who 
had received mandatory parole.  Between 
1990 and 1999 the percent successful 
among discretionary parolees varied between 
50% and 56%, while the percent successful 
among mandatory parolees varied between
24% and 33%.

Among parole discharges in 1999 who
had been released from prison for the
first time on their current offense,
mandatory parolees had a higher success 
rate (79%) than discretionary parolees 
(61%). Discretionary parolees in 1999 who 
had been re-released from prison were more 
likely to be successful (37%) than mandatory 
parolees (17%).

Among parole discharges, success
rates rose for blacks and Hispanics;
dropped for whites 

Between 1990 and 1999 the success rates 
among State parole discharges increased 
from 33% to 39% among blacks and increased 
from 31% to 51% among Hispanics, but 
dropped from 44% to 41% among whites. The 
11 percentage-point difference in success
rates between white and black parole
discharges in 1990 narrowed to less
than 2 percentage points in 1999.

Hispanic parolees, who had the lowest
rate of success in 1990, had the highest
rate in 1999.

For female parole discharges, the rate of
success rose over 10 percentage points
(from 37% in 1990 to 48% in 1999).  The
success rate among male parole discharges 
increased from 36% to 39%.

Older parole discharges had the highest
rates of success in both years. Accounting 
for 2.1% of discharges in 1999, parolees 
age 55 or older had the highest rate of 
successful completion (55%).  Among parole 
discharges in other age groups, success 
rates fluctuated between 36% and 43%. 

Success rates highest among first
releases serving less than 12 
months in prison

Among parole discharges, 74% of first
releases who had served less than 12
months in prison successfully completed
parole, the highest success rate among
paroled first releases.  As the length of
time served in prison increased for first
releases, the success rate declined, with 
offenders with the longest time served (5 
years or more) having the lowest success 
rate (62%).  The rate of success for this 
group still exceeded the overall success 
rate of 42% for all parolees.
 
In 1999 parole discharges served 
an average of 26 months under
supervision, up from 23 months 
in 1990

Among first releases from prison, 
successful parole board releases
served, on average, 34 months in 
1999; while successful mandatory 
parole releases served 21 months.  
Unsuccessful parole discharges
released by a parole board served 
an average 26 months, while those
released by mandatory parole served 
19 months.  Overall, successful parole
discharges in 1999 served an average 
of 27 months under parole supervision
and unsuccessful discharges served 
24 months.

Regardless of outcome, State parole
discharges who had been released by a
parole board served longer under
supervision in 1999 than in 1990.

Rates of successful termination
higher when California is excluded

The size and make-up of California's
parole population, combined with the 
low percent of successful terminations
(25% in 1999), affect the national rate 
of success for parole discharges.  If 
data from California are removed from
the analysis, the comparative rates of
success for discretionary and mandatory
parole change dramatically. 

Overall, California accounted for nearly
30% of all State parole discharges during 
1999. Discretionary parole, though available 
as a method of release, is rarely used in 
California.  In 1999 more than 99% of 
California's parole discharges had received 
mandatory parole.
  
When California data are excluded, the
success rate for all parole discharges
rises to 53% (from 42%), and the rate 
for mandatory parolees increases to
64% (from 33%) in 1999.

-------------------------------------------

Number of parole violators returned
to prison continued to rise during 
the 1990's

In 1999, 197,606 parole violators were
returned to State prison, up from 27,177
in 1980 and 131,502 in 1990.  As a
percentage of all admissions to State
prison, parole violators more than
doubled from 17% in 1980 to 35% in
1999. 

Between 1990 and 1999 the number of
parole violators rose 50%, while the
number of new court commitments rose
7%.  On average, the number of parole
violators grew 4% per year, while the
number of new court commitments rose
0.8% per year. 

In 1999 parole violators accounted for
more than 50% of State prison admission 
in California (67%), Utah (55%), Montana 
(53%), and Louisiana (53%)  In five States 
-- Florida (7%), Alabama (9%), Indiana 
(10%), Mississippi (10%) and West Virginia 
(10%) -- parole violators comprised 10% or 
less of all admissions.

In 36 States parole violators increased
as a percentage of admissions between
1990 and 1999.  As a percentage of all
admissions, parole violators rose the
most in Louisiana (from 15% in 1990 to
53% in 1999) and in Montana (from 20%
to 53%). 
  
Nearly a quarter of State prisoners 
in 1997 were parole violators

Based on personal interviews of State
inmates, an estimated 24% of prisoners
in 1997 said they were on parole at the
time of the offense for which they were
serving time in prison (up from 22% in
1991).  Of the 1,129,180 inmates under
the jurisdiction of State prison 
authorities at yearend 1997, approximately 
271,000 were parole violators. 

Parole violators in prison in 1997 were
older and more likely to have committed
a public order or drug offense than
parole violators in 1991.  In 1997 about
25% of parole violators in prison were
age 40 or older, compared to 17% in
1991.  In 1997 an estimated 34% were
serving time for a violent offense and
23% for a drug offense. In 1991, 36% of
parole violators were in prison for a
violent offense; 19% for a drug offense. 
In both years, more than 42% of parole
violators reported having been
incarcerated 3 or more times in the past.

70% of parole violators in prison in
1997 returned for a new offense

Among parole violators in State prison 
in 1997, 215,964 (85%) reported that their
parole had been revoked or taken away
for violating the conditions of their
release.  Of that number, 70% said that
their parole had been revoked because
of an arrest or conviction for a new
offense; 22% said they had absconded
or otherwise failed to report to a parole
officer; 16% said they had a drug-related
violation; and 18% reported other
reasons such as possession of a gun,
maintaining contact with known felons,
or failure to maintain employment.

Half of parole violators incarcerated
in 3 States 

The three largest State prison systems
(California, Texas, and New York) held
over half of all parole violators in prison
in 1997.  California held 22% of all
parole violators in prison, Texas, 21%,
and New York, 8%.  Within each of these 
States, the percentage of prisoners who 
were parole violators was higher than the 
national level: 39% in Texas, 38% in 
California, and 28% in New York, compared 
to 24% nationally.

Among parole violators returned to prison, 
those held in California (60%) were the 
least likely to have been arrested or 
convicted for a new offense and the most 
likely to have been returned for a drug 
violation (23%).  About 11% of parole 
violators in New York and Texas reported 
a drug violation as a reason for their 
return to prison.

Characteristics of parole violators
varied among the 3 largest States
   
A higher percentage of parole violators
in California  (7.1%)  were women than
in Texas (5.4%) and New York (3.3%). 
Nationally, 4.7% of parole violators in
State prison in 1997 were women.

New York had the highest percentage 
of parole violators in prison who were
black (54%), followed by Texas (50%)
and California (33%).  In New York, 
11% of parole violators were white; in
Texas, 23%; in California, 31%.  The
percent Hispanic among parole violators
ranged from 26% to 33% in the three
States.

New York had the highest percentage of 
parole violators convicted of a violent
offense (41%), compared to 33% in Texas 
and 24% in California. New York also had 
the highest percentage of parole violators 
returned for a drug offense (34%), 
compared to 27% in California and 21% in 
Texas.

Among the three largest States, parole
violators in California had the longest
criminal histories.  More than 58% of
parole violators in California had been
incarcerated at least 3 times in the past,
compared to 42% in Texas and 35% in
New York.  Nationwide, 44% of parole
violators reported three or more prior
incarcerations.

Methodology

National Corrections Reporting 
Program (NCRP)

The National Corrections Reporting
Program collects individual level data 
for persons admitted to and released
from State prisons and offenders 
exiting parole supervision, in each 
year.  NCRP is the only national 
collection that provides data on offense,
sentence length, and time served for
State prisoners and parole discharges. 
While NCRP collects data on all
offenders, this report includes data on
prisoners with a total sentence of more
than a year.

In 1999 release data were reported by
37 States and the California Youth
Authority:  Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia,
Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South
Dakota,  Tennessee, Texas, Virginia,
Washington, West Virginia, and
Wisconsin.   

These 37 States reported a total of
499,886 releases from prison in the
National Prisoner Statistics series, 
which represented 91% of all releases 
in 1999.  Between 35 and 39 States
provided data on releases from 1990 
o 1999.  Data were reported on
maximum sentence length for 93% of
227,100 first releases reported to the
NCRP in 1990 and 93% of the 243,055
first releases reported in 1999.  Data
were reported on time served in jail for
77% in 1990 and 85% in 1999 and time
served in prison for 95% in 1990 and
99% in 1999.  

In 1999, 27 States and the California
Youth Authority reported data on parole
discharges:   Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Illinois, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri,
Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, 
North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina,
South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas,
Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.  

These 27 States reported 335,646
parole discharges in the 1999 Annual
Parole Survey, which represented 86%
of all State parole discharges in that
year.  From 1990 to 1999, 27 to 31
States submitted data on parole
discharges.  States that reported only
successful discharges or only
unsuccessful discharges were excluded
from calculations of success rates.  

Annual Parole Survey

The Annual Parole Survey provides a
count of the total number of persons
supervised in the community on 
January 1 and December 31, and a
count of the number entering and
leaving supervision during the collection
year.  The survey covered all 50 States,
the District of Columbia, and the Federal
System, for all years from 1980-2000.  

The 2000 parole survey was sent to 54
respondents, including 52 central
reporters, the California Youth Authority,
and one municipal agency.  States with
multiple reporters were Alabama (2) and
California (2).  The 2000 survey had a
100% response rate.  

National Prisoners Statistics (NPS-1)

The National Prisoners Statistics
(NPS-1) series obtains yearend and
midyear counts of prisoners from 
departments of correction in each of 
the 50 States, the District of Columbia,
and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 
Excluded from NPS-1 counts are persons 
confined in locally administered
confinement facilities who are under the
jurisdiction of local authorities.  

NPS-1 also collects comparable data on
prison admissions and releases with a
sentence of more than 1 year.  
Admission counts include data on new 
court commitments, parole violators 
returned to prison, and other types of 
admission.  Data on method of release 
from State prison include counts for 
mandatory parole, discretionary parole,
other conditional releases, and uncon-
ditional releases from prison.  Trans-
fers, AWOL's and escapees are excluded 
from the release data in this report.

Surveys of Inmates in State and 
Federal Correctional Facilities, 1991 
and 1997

The Surveys of Inmates in State and
Federal Correctional Facilities,
conducted every 5 to 6 years, provide
detailed data on individual characteris-
tics of prison inmates.  Based on scien-
tifically selected samples of facilities 
and of inmates held in them, these 
surveys provide detailed information 
unavailable from any other source.  

To determine characteristics of inmates
to be released by yearend 1999 --
including gender, age, race/Hispanic
origin, offense, criminal history,
substance abuse, mental illness and
homelessness -- information was drawn 
for this report from the 1997 survey.  
Comparisons of parole violators and 
reasons for revocation in California, 
New York, and Texas (self-representing 
States in the sample) were also based 
on data from the 1997 survey.
