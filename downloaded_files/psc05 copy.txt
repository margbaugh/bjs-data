Highlights

* At least two-thirds of the State court prosecutors 
had litigated a computer-related crime such as credit 
card fraud(80%), identity theft(69%), or transmission 
of child pornography (67%). 

* Nearly all the prosecutors' offices (98%) reported 
their State had a domestic violence statute; 28% of 
the offices maintained a domestic violence prosecution 
unit.

* A quarter (24%) of the offices participated in a State 
or local task force for homeland security; one-third 
reported an office member attended training on homeland 
security issues. 
  
* Most prosecutors(95%)relied on State operated forensic 
laboratories to perform DNA analysis, with about a third 
(34%) also using privately operated DNA labs.   

* Two-thirds of prosecutors' offices had prosecuted a 
juvenile case in criminal court during 2005. A third of 
the offices had a designated attorney for these special 
cases. 

* In 2005 nearly 40% of the prosecutors considered their 
office a community prosecution site actively involving 
law enforcement and the community to improve public 
safety.  
-----------------------------------------------

State court prosecutors in 2005 reported facing an
increasingly complex composition of cases and issues 
with staff and budget resources essentially unchanged 
since 2001. Prosecutors' offices encountered high-tech 
offenses such as–-
  
* computer crime

* credit card fraud

* identity theft.  

* State prosecutors also have homeland security responsibilities:

* A quarter participated in a State or local homeland security
task force.

* A third reported an office member attended homeland security
training.

In 2005, 2,344 prosecutors' offices prosecuted felony cases
in State courts of general jurisdiction. These offices 
employed about 78,000 attorneys, investigators, victim 
advocates, and support staff, with a median annual budget 
of $355,000. In 2005 half of all offices closed 250 or more
felony cases. 

These findings from the 2005 National Survey of State 
Court Prosecutors represent the most recent in a series 
which began in 1990. The 2005 findings are based on a 
nationally representative sample of 310 prosecutors 
offices selected from among the 2,344 offices that try
felony cases. The study does not include municipal and
county attorneys who primarily operate in courts of 
limited jurisdiction. 

A chief prosecutor is the elected or appointed attorney
advocating for the public in felony cases and in a variety 
of generally less serious offenses. Office titles for 
chief prosecutor include district attorney, county attorney, 
prosecuting attorney, solicitor, commonwealth's attorney, 
and State's attorney (see Appendix). State law determines 
the number of chief prosecutors and whether they are 
elected or appointed. In 2005 Texas had the largest number 
of chief prosecutors (155), followed by Virginia(120), and 
Missouri(115). Except for Alaska, Connecticut, the District 
of Columbia, and New Jersey all chief prosecutors in 2005 
were elected officials. 

Nearly all prosecutors' offices serve a county-based
jurisdiction. The size of population served by offices 
varied considerably among the 2,344 offices. Half of
all prosecutors' offices served a population of 36,500 
or less. This report provides information for all offices, 
divided into four groups, by size of jurisdiction and the 
full- or part-time status of the chief prosecutor:

* A full-time office in a large jurisdiction refers to an
office with a full-time chief prosecutor serving 1 million 
or more persons.

* A full-time office in a medium jurisdiction refers to an
office with a full-time chief prosecutor serving a district 
with 250,000 to 999,999 persons.

A full-time office in a small jurisdiction refers to an
office with a full-time chief prosecutor serving a district 
with less than 250,000 persons.

A part-time office has a part-time chief prosecutor serving
a district of any population size.***Footnote 1: The full-
and part-time categories are comparable to the categories
used in earlier reports.***
 
Staffing in prosecutors' offices

In 2005 the Nation's prosecutors' offices maintained a 
workforce of approximately 78,000 full-time and part-time 
staff, including assistant prosecutors, supervisory attorneys, 
investigators, victim advocates, and support staff. This 
total represents an increase in staff from the 57,000 recorded 
in 1992. The increase in total staff experienced during most 
of the 1990's has leveled off since 2001.

In 2005 assistant prosecutors and support staff each represented 
about a third of prosecutors' office personnel. Total employment 
in prosecutors' offices during 2003 accounted for nearly 4% of 
the more than 2.1 million State and local justice
employees across the Nation.***Footnote 2: Justice Expenditure 
and Employment, 2003, reports a total State and local justice 
system employment of 2,107,826 in October 2003, available at
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/jeeus03.htm>.***

In 2005 almost three-quarters of all offices reported having
a full-time chief prosecutor, compared to about half in 1990. 
Seventy percent of all offices employed at least one full-time
assistant prosecutor. Overall, 90% of the total staff 
positions were full-time.

Median staff size in 2005 for all offices (staff persons),
as well as median number of staff across the different 
position categories and types of offices, remained relatively 
similar to that found in 2001. 

Offices serving larger jurisdictions had more staff. Full-time 
offices in large jurisdictions had a median total staff size 
of 419 with a median of 141 assistant prosecutors. Full-time 
offices serving medium-sized populations had a median of 105 
total staff; those serving smaller populations (under 250,000) 
had a median staff size of 10, and part-time offices had a
median total staff size of 3.

Attorney recruitment and retention 
in prosecutors' offices

Problems with recruiting new staff attorneys were reported
by 24% of prosecutors' offices and problems in retaining 
staff attorneys by 35%. 

Thirty-seven percent of full-time medium offices and 27% 
of full-time large offices reported problems in 
recruiting new staff attorneys compared to 11% of part-time 
offices. Similarly, over 60% of full-time large and medium 
offices indicated a problem in retaining staff attorneys 
while 34% of full-time small offices and 22% of part-time
offices reported such a problem. Salary was the primary
obstacle cited by prosecutors' offices with recruitment 
problems (83%) and offices with retention problems (71%).
 
Term of office, length of service, 
and salary of chief prosecutors

In 2005, 85% of chief prosecutors reported they had been
elected or appointed to a 4-year term. The median length 
of service was 8 years in 2005. About a quarter of the 
chief prosecutors (28%) were relatively new to the job 
having served 4 years or less in 2005. The longest tenure 
among surveyed respondents was 35 years.

In 2005 half of all offices reported the chief prosecutor
earned $85,000 per year or more, a 33% increase in median 
salary since 1996 ($64,000). Nearly 4 in 10 chief 
prosecutors (37%) had a salary of $100,000 or more. The 
amount of annual salary varied by size of jurisdiction 
served and whether the chief served full- or part-time. 
In 2005 the median salary for full-time large offices 
was $149,000 compared to a median of $42,000 for 
part-time offices.

Budget of prosecutors' offices

In 2005 prosecutors' offices nationwide had budgets 
which totaled over $4.9 billion. Half of the offices 
reported an annual budget of $355,000 or more, an 
increase in the median annual budget for prosecutors' 
offices from $264,000 in 1992 as measured in constant 
2005 dollars. Reflecting the wide variation in 
populations served, annual office budgets across the 
U.S. ranged from about $5,000 to $285 million. 

Half of all offices received at least 82% of their funds 
for prosecutorial functions from the county government 
(not shown in table). About 32% of offices relied
exclusively on the county for their budget. A decade ago 
(1994) 46% reported receiving their total prosecutorial 
budget from the county. In 2005 a greater proportion of 
offices received State funds (49%) or State and Federal
grants (40%) than in 1994. 

Types of cases litigated by 
prosecutors' offices

In addition to felony criminal matters, prosecutors' 
offices litigated a variety of other case types. At 
least 9 out of 10 offices also had jurisdiction over
misdemeanor (95%) and juvenile cases (90%). Traffic 
violations were prosecuted by 88% of the offices. 
Prosecutors' offices were also frequently responsible 
for prosecuting civil cases (60%), child support 
enforcement (57%), and felony appeals (54%).

----------------------------------------
Adjustment for inflation

Historical budget estimates were adjusted for 
inflation using the average Consumer Price Index 
for a given calendar year. These data represent 
changes in price for all goods and services 
purchased for consumption by urban households. 
See <http://www.bls.gov/data/>.
------------------------------------------

Computer-related crime prosecutions Prosecutors' offices 
litigated a variety of crimes related to computer and 
electronic commerce fraud. Over the 12 months preceding 
the survey, 60% of the prosecutors' offices reported
prosecuting criminal cases specifically under their State's
computer crime statutes. Most offices prosecuted a broad 
range of electronic-related crimes: 

* credit card fraud (80%)

* bank card fraud (71%)

* identity theft (69%)***Footnote 3:For more information 
on identity theft victimization, see Identity Theft, 2004 
at <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/it04.htm>.***

* transmission of child pornography (67%).

Half or more of the large full-time prosecutors' offices
prosecuted cyberstalking (82%), computer forgery(56%), and 
unauthorized access (hacking)(53%)cases. The part-time 
offices also reported prosecutions related to bank card 
fraud(81%), credit card fraud(78%), and identity theft(63%). 

State court prosecutors and 
homeland security

Although a relatively small percentage of offices reported
prosecution of a terrorism-related case (2%),a third had an 
office member receive training on homeland security issues. 
A quarter of the offices took part in State or local 
homeland security task forces. Prosecutors' offices serving 
jurisdictions of 1 million or more persons were the most 
likely to have reported involvement in homeland security 
issues, 28% compared to 7% or less in full-time medium and
small offices. 

Domestic violence prosecutions

Nearly all prosecutors' offices (98%) operated in a State
which maintained a domestic violence statute. About a 
quarter of the offices (28%) had a domestic violence 
prosecution unit.

Criminal cases and convictions

In 2005 State court prosecutors reported closing over 2.4
million felony cases and nearly 7.5 million misdemeanor 
cases.***Footnote 4: Methods of counting criminal cases 
vary among prosecutors' offices. About 45% indicated 
counting criminal cases by each defendant; 25%, by each 
charge; 20%, by each incident; 3%, by the most serious 
charge; and 7%, by other methods or did not respond.*** 

The median number of criminal felony and misdemeanor cases
closed per office was 1,100. About 90 felony cases per 
assistant prosecutor were closed.***Footnote 5: This 
estimate was calculated by dividing the number of felony 
cases closed (2,418,242) by the number of assistant 
prosecutors (24,146) and supervisory attorneys (2,829).***

An assumption made in calculating the estimate is that all
assistant prosecutors litigated felony cases, which may not 
always be the case.

Jury felony trial verdicts were relatively rare, as they
represented approximately 3% of total felony cases closed. 
Large, full-time offices prosecuted a median of 230 felony 
jury trials. By comparison, the median number of felony 
jury trials for part-time offices was two. 

Juveniles proceeded against in 
criminal courts

In 2005, 65% of prosecutors' offices indicated they had
proceeded against juvenile cases in criminal court. During 
the prior year prosecutors' offices reported proceeding 
against over 23,000 juvenile cases in criminal court. The 
median number of juvenile cases proceeded against in 
criminal court per office was four. Half of full-time large 
offices proceeded against 65 or more juvenile cases in 
criminal court; full-time medium offices, 12 or more; 
full-time small offices, 4 or more; and part-time offices, 
2 or more.

About 3% of the offices reported a specialized unit that
prosecuted juvenile cases in criminal court. These 
specialized units were more likely to be found in full-time 
large offices (30%) than full-time medium offices (10%) or 
full-time small offices (2%). 

A third (34%) of prosecutors' offices had a designated
attorney handle juvenile cases proceeded against in 
criminal court. Forty percent of full-time small offices 
had designated attorneys handle juvenile cases in criminal 
court, 14% of full-time large offices, 25% of full-time 
medium offices, and 25% of part-time offices. Thirteen 
percent of all offices had written guidelines for handling
juvenile cases in criminal court. 

------------------------------------------
Measuring juvenile cases
proceeded against in criminal
court

Measuring the number of juvenile cases proceeded 
against is difficult due to the various mechanisms 
by which a juvenile case can reach criminal court 
(judicial waiver, direct file by prosecutor and 
statutory exclusion of certain offenses from 
juvenile court jurisdiction, the variation in the 
definition of juvenile across States, and the 
different terminology used by States in referring 
to this type of case). The total number of juvenile 
cases proceeded in criminal court presented in this 
report is based on information supplied by 
prosecutors' offices. 
----------------------------------------

Full-time large offices (58%) more frequently had written
guidelines than their full-time and part-time office coun-
terparts.

Work-related threats or assaults 
against staff in prosecutors' offices
 
Overall, 40% of prosecutors' offices reported a work-related
threat or assault against a staff member. In 1992 about a 
quarter of the offices reported a threat or assault. In 2005,
84% of full-time large offices reported a work-related
threat or assault against a staff member, 57% of full-time 
medium offices, 43% of full-time small offices, and 22% of 
part-time offices.

In 2005, 3% of offices reported that their chief prosecutor
was the victim of a battery or assault. About one-quarter 
(24%) of part-time offices reported a battery or assault 
against their chief prosecutor.

Security measures used 
in prosecutors' offices

Prosecutors' offices used various security measures to protect 
their staff and building. Electronic security systems (27%), 
building guards (26%), or metal detectors (23%) were used by 
over 20% of all prosecutors' offices nationwide. Nearly 2 in 
10 offices had electronic surveillance (17%). The percentage 
of prosecutors' offices using building guards and metal
detectors in 2005 doubled since 1994 when 10% of offices
reported using building guards and 10% metal detectors.

The chief prosecutor carried a firearm for personal security
in 20% of the offices. A quarter of full-time small offices 
indicated the chief prosecutor carried a firearm for personal 
security, as did 10% of full-time medium offices, 11% of 
part-time offices, and 16% of full-time large offices. 


Among all offices 27% reported that a staff investigator
carried a firearm. Staff investigators were more likely to 
carry a firearm in full-time large (92%)and full-time 
medium (71%) offices than in full-time small (28%) offices. 
Assistant prosecutors in 44% of full-time large offices,
25% of full-time medium offices, 15% of full-time small
offices carried a firearm for personal security.

DNA evidence used by prosecutors' 
offices

In 2005 a State-operated forensic laboratory performed DNA
testing for 95% of all offices, up from 61% in 2001.
***Footnote 6: For more information on DNA laboratories, 
see Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories, 
2002, <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cpffcl02.htm>.***
Prosecutors' offices also used other sources of DNA analysis,
such as a private laboratory (34%), the Federal Bureau of
Investigations (FBI) (13%), and a local agency (6%). 

When asked about problems in the use of DNA evidence, nearly
half (47%) of all offices indicated at least one instance of 
excessive delay in getting laboratory results. Excessive 
delays in getting DNA results were reported by 60% of 
full-time large offices, 80% of full-time medium offices, and 
51% of full-time small offices. Inconclusive DNA results were 
reported by about a quarter of all offices, 12% for improper 
collection of evidence by the police, and difficulty at least 
once in getting DNA results admitted in court as evidence by 
1%.

Community prosecution 

Community prosecution has been defined by prosecutors as a
way to engage the community to solve crime and coordinate 
their office, law enforcement, local residents, and local 
agencies and organizations to improve public safety and 
quality of life.***Footnote 6: For more information on 
community prosecution see Nugent, Elaine and Gerard A. 
Rainville, "The State of Community Prosecution: Results 
from a National Survey," The Prosecutor, March/April 2001, 
pp. 26-33 and the Office of Justice Programs website
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/prosecution/commlinks.htm>.***

During the previous year two-thirds of all prosecutors'
offices used tools other than criminal prosecution to 
address community problems. Over half of the offices 
involved the community to identify crime or problem areas. 
Sixteen percent assigned prosecutors to specific geographic
areas. Tools other than criminal prosecution used to address 
community problems were utilized by 95% of full-time large 
offices, 80% of full-time medium offices, 72% of full-time
small offices, and 43% of part-time offices. Assigning
prosecutors to specific geographic areas was done most often 
by full-time large offices (60%)compared to their smaller 
full-time and part-time counterparts. 

Virtually all the offices (99%) indicated a formal or informal 
relationship with law enforcement agencies. Eighty-eight percent 
of the offices reported a formal or informal relationship with 
other governmental agencies, 70% community associations, and 
56% private organizations. About three-fifths of all offices 
met regularly with school and advocacy groups. Nearly half 
of the offices reported meeting regularly with youth service
organizations and business groups. About 3 in 10 met regularly 
with neighborhood associations. Only 6% of all offices 
indicated meeting regularly with tenant associations. 

Twenty-four percent of all offices assigned prosecutors to
oversee community-related activities. Of the offices assigning 
prosecutors to community-related activities, 37% reported that 
these prosecutors were located outside of the central 
prosecutors' offices in places such as the police department 
or a community-based office. The types of offenses prosecuted 
most often by prosecutors assigned to community-related 
activities were drug crime(81%), violent crime(77%), juvenile 
crime (53%), and property crime(63%)(not shown in table). 
Over three-fourths of the offices that assigned prosecutors to
community-related activities indicated that these prosecutors 
carried a full caseload.

Methodology

The chief prosecutors surveyed are a nationally representative 
sample of those that prosecute felony cases in State courts of 
general jurisdiction. Questionnaires were mailed to 310 chief
prosecutors from the 2,344 who try felony cases in State courts.

Sampling frame

The sampling frame used for the 2005 NSP was similar to that
employed for the 2001 NSP, but the 2005 frame was updated 
according to the current jurisdictions. In general, each 
district is composed of counties. However, the 13 Connecticut 
districts are composed of townships/cities. Additionally, 
concurrent districts exist in Alabama and Texas. Concurrent 
prosecutorial districts are pairs of districts which both 
cover all or part of the same county. The frame included chief
prosecutor mailing information for each districts' geographic 
compositions along with 2004 total population estimates 
associated with each district. For districts comprised of 
counties, the 2004 Inter-censal Census total population
(<http://www.census.gov/popest/counties/files/CO-EST2004-ALL
DATA.csv>, "POPESTIMATE2004," May 20, 2005)was linked to each 
district component and then summed within district. For 
Connecticut, 2000 Census population counts
(<http://www.opm.state.ct.us/pdpd3/data/estimate.htm>, May
20, 2005) were linked to each township/city and summed within 
district. Each 2000 Census district total population was then
inflated by a common factor to force the total population
over the 13 Connecticut districts to equal the 2004 Intercensal 
Census statewide estimate. The National Opinion Research Center
then drew a stratified systematic sample from the 2,344
prosecutorial districts. 

Sample

The 2,344 prosecutorial districts were grouped into 5 strata, 
depending on their estimated 2004 populations. A sample of 310 
districts were selected proportional to the total number of 
districts available in each stratum. A sample of 310 districts 
was chosen that is expected to yield a coefficient of variation 
of about 2% for sample estimates related to population size. 
Each chief prosecutor had only one chance to be in the sample.
    
Statistics computed using sample survey responses have an
"analysis weight" for conversion of sample results to 
statistics applicable to the entire population--in the NSP 
context, the entire population of felony prosecutors in 
State courts.

One office each in Strata 1, 3, and 4 did not respond to the
2005 survey. Taking this into account, nonresponse adjusted 
weights were calculated for each of the remaining 307 
respondents; that is, within each stratum the inverse of the 
probability of selection (the inverse of the number of
districts selected out of the total number of districts
within the stratum) was adjusted to force the final number of 
districts within the stratum to sum to the original total number 
of districts within the stratum. The final nonresponse adjusted 
weight should be used for analytical purposes. 

Sampling error

Since the data in this report came from a sample, a sampling
error(standard error)is associated with each reported number. 
In general, if the difference between two numbers is greater 
than twice the standard error for that difference, there is 
a 95% confidence of a real difference that is not simply the 
result of using a sample rather than the entire population. 
All the differences discussed in the text of this report 
were statistically significant at or above the 95% confidence
level.

Data collection

The 2005 survey was conducted through a mailed questionnaire, 
consisting of 48 questions that encompassed 172 items of 
information. The questionnaires were mailed to the survey
participants by the National Opinion Research Center in June
2005. Follow-up continued until January 2006. Of the 310 
prosecutors= offices in the survey, 307 completed the 
questionnaire.

The survey was completed by 262 offices in 1992, 269 offices
in 1994, and 272 offices in 1996.

Overall, the survey response rate was 99%(307/310). Several
kinds of requested information were difficult for prosecutors' 
offices to provide, such as workload statistics, data related 
to number of juveniles proceeded against, and budget
information.

In reference to felony cases closed, 5.9% of the offices did
not provide information and for misdemeanor cases closed 8.1% 
did not provide information. Of the 254 offices that proceeded
against juveniles in criminal court, 2.8% were unable to
provide the number of cases prosecuted. The 2005 budget figure 
for prosecutorial function was missing in 1.6% of survey 
respondents.
