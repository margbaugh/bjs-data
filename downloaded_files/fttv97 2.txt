During each fiscal year, 1996 and 1997, U.S. district courts terminated
an average of 296,000 cases.  Approximately 84% of these cases were
civil, and 16% were criminal cases.  Of the nearly 500,000 civil cases
terminated during fiscal years 1996-97, 19% (96,284) were tort claims
in which plaintiffs claimed injury, loss, or damage from defendants'
negligent or intentional acts.  

This report presents data on the 3,023 tort cases that a jury or bench
trial decided during this 2-year period.  Data on tort cases from 1996
and 1997 were combined to provide a larger number of cases for detailed
analysis.  Previously,  the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reported
findings from a study of 1994-95 tort trial cases. (Federal Tort Trials
and Verdicts, 1994-1995, BJS Special Report (NCJ 165810).)

Compared to fiscal years 1994-95, during 1996-97 --
* the overall number of tort cases terminated in U.S. district courts
increased 17% 

* the number of tort cases terminated by a trial verdict declined 10%

* the percentage of plaintiff winners in tort trial cases increased
slightly from 43% to 45%

* the median award amount to plaintiff winners remained about $141,000.

Highlights

* During fiscal years 1996-97, over 80% of cases terminated in U.S.
district courts dealt with civil matters.  Of the 250,000 civil cases
terminated per year, 19% were tort cases.  

* During 1996-97 U.S. district courts terminated 96, 284 tort cases, an
increase of 17% from 1994-95 when 82,333 tort cases were terminated.

* Compared to 1994-95, tort cases terminated by trial verdict decreased
10% from 3,356 to 3,023 cases in 1996-97.

* Of the 96,284 tort cases terminated during fiscal years 1996-97, a
jury or bench trial decided 3%, or 3,023 cases. Tort trial verdicts
provide the most complete data to examine award amounts at the Federal
level.

* Nearly three-fourths of tort trials in U.S. district courts resulted
from a dispute between citizens and/or corporations from different
States (diversity of citizenship).

* A jury decided 75% of all tort cases brought to trial in U.S. district
courts.  A jury trial decided a majority of diversity of citizenship
cases (88%) and Federal question cases (63%).
 
* Plaintiffs won 45% of all tort trial cases in which a judgment was
known, 44% of personal injury cases, 29% of product liability cases, and
54% of cases involving property damage.

* Of the 1,249 tort trial cases won by plaintiffs, 86% (1,073) received
monetary damages with a median award of $141,000.  The award was $1
million or more in 17% of these cases in 1996-97 and in 18% of the cases
in 1994-95. <<This sentenced was revised 5/3/99>>

* The average case processing time from filing to termination in 1996-97
was 20.2 months, down from 21.8 months in 1994-95.

This report contains information about tort cases terminated by trial
verdict in U.S. district courts during fiscal years 1996 and 1997 as
well as general trends in tort cases terminated in U.S. district courts
since 1990.  For this report only those cases terminated after the
completion of a trial by jury or trial before a judge or magistrate were
used.  According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
(AOUSC), a trial is considered complete when a verdict is returned by
a jury or a decision is rendered by the court.  Jury or bench trials
terminated before or during the trial are excluded from this analysis. 
Tort trial cases appealed as well as the outcomes of appeal are not
reported.  Data for this report were obtained from information compiled
by the AOUSC.

Tort trial cases terminated in U.S. district courts since 1990

The overall number of tort cases terminated fluctuated between fiscal
years 1990 and 1997 (figure 1).  During 1991 the overall number of tort
cases that were terminated increased because a backlog of cases from the
early 1980's was processed.  These cases had been filed by the U.S.
Government to recover overpayments of veterans' benefits and defaulted
student loans.  Another reason for the 1991 increase was a rise in
asbestos filings during 1990 that were terminating in 1991.  Civil case
terminations rose again in 1996 because of an increase in Federal
question case terminations attributed mostly to breast implant cases
that were transferred to a single U.S. district court as part of a
multi-district litigation.  (Northern District of Alabama multidistrict
litigation docket number 926.  Source: Administrative Office of the U.S
Courts, Judicial Business of the United States, 1996.)

Overall, the number of tort cases terminated by a trial verdict in U.S.
district courts declined by an annual average of about 4% between 1990
and 1997.  Over 2,000 tort cases were terminated by trial verdict in
1990, dropping to 1,714 in 1993, and reaching just over 1,500 in 1997
(figure 1).  Tort cases terminated by a trial verdict as a percentage of
all tort cases also have declined slightly from 5% in 1990 to 3% in
1997.  Over the past 7 years, an increasing percentage of tort cases
were disposed of before trial.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nontrial tort cases terminated in U.S. district courts, 1996-97

Of the 93,261 nontrial tort cases terminated in 1996-97, 65% were
terminated after the issue was joined.  An issue is considered joined
after the defendant has answered the complaint or has otherwise
responded in accordance with Rule 12, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
or as mandated by the court.  Of the 60,376 nontrial tort cases joined
during 1996-97, 17% were terminated with no court action, 17% at the
pretrial conference, 18% by a judicial action by a judge or magistrate
judge but before any pretrial conference, and 1% by a request for a new
trial on the entire case before a final judgment was entered (trial de
novo).

Nearly 6 in 10 nontrial tort cases terminated after the issue was joined
originated in a U.S. district court, while about 3 in 10 were removed
from a State court.  The majority (53%) of these nontrial tort cases
were brought to a U.S. district court based on a diversity of
citizenship issue and 39% because of a Federal question.  Of the 5,330
nontrial tort cases for which a winner was known, defendants won in 71%
and plaintiffs in 22% of cases.  Monetary awards were given in 16% of
the cases after the issue was joined.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
U.S. district court jurisdiction

Jurisdiction refers to the basis for filing a civil action in a U.S.
district court.  U.S. district courts exercise jurisdiction in civil
actions that-- 

* deal with a Federal question arising from the interpretation and
application of the U.S. Constitution, acts of Congress, or treaties
("Federal question")

* exceed $75,000 and are between parties (citizens and/or corporations)
residing in different States or parties of a State and citizens,
corporations, or subjects of a foreign country ("diversity of
citizenship")  (The minimum value required was $10,000 until 1989 and
$50,000 until 1996, when it was raised to $75,000 in P.L. 104-317,
Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1996.)  

* are initiated by the U.S. Government ("U.S. plaintiff"), (Title 28
U.S.C. Section 1345 and 1348.) or 

* are brought against the U.S. Government for alleged negligent or
wrongful acts resulting in personal injury or property damage ("U.S.
defendant").  (Title 28 U.S.C. Section 1346.) 

During fiscal years 1996-97, 72% of tort trial cases were tried in U.S.
district courts because of the diversity of citizenship between the
parties in the case (table 1).

Federal questions provided the basis for jurisdiction in 16% of the
cases, while 12% were filed in U.S. district courts because the U.S.
Government was the defendant.  Jurisdiction based on local questions or
where the U.S. Government was the plaintiff accounted for less than 1%
of tort trial cases terminated in U.S. district courts.

Federal jurisdiction in tort trials over time

Since 1994 the decline in the number of tort trial cases terminated in
U.S. district courts occurred across all areas of Federal jurisdiction. 
During fiscal years 1994 through 1997, the number of Federal question
cases terminated by trial decreased from 329 to 226, and cases in which
the U.S.Government was a defendant from 209 to 174 (table 2).

United States was the defendant remained steady at about 12% of tort
trials terminated between 1994 and 1997.  

Origin of tort trial cases

The majority (62%) of tort trial cases terminated in fiscal years
1996-97 originated in U.S. district court (table 3).  An additional  28%
of all tort trial cases were civil actions initiated in State courts but
removed to a U.S. district court, 6% were reopened or reinstated, and 3%
were transferred from another district.  Less than 1% of cases were
either remanded from appellate court, appealed to a district  judge from
a magistrate judge judgment, or originated from a multi-district
litigation.

The nature of tort trial cases

For the purposes of this report, tort cases are organized into two
categories: personal and property.  Personal tort cases involve injury
to a person or to the reputation of a person.  Property tort cases
involve damage to one's personal property.

During 1996-97 personal injury cases accounted for 9 out of 10  tort
trial cases terminated in U.S. district courts (table 4).  Motor vehicle
(19%) and product liability (16%) cases were the most frequent types of
personal injury cases, followed by medical malpractice cases (7%).  By
comparison, property damage cases constituted the remaining 7% of tort
trials terminated in U.S. district courts.  The largest portion of
property damage cases involved fraud (3%) and other property damage
(3%).  Property damage associated with product liability constituted 1%
of tort trial cases terminated in U.S. district courts.

Over the 4 years between 1994 and 1997, the overall number of tort
trials declined 13%, with more than 200 fewer tort cases terminated by a
trial verdict in 1997 compared to 1994 (table 5). This drop in the
number of tort trial cases is due largely to a decline in certain types
of personal injury cases.  Between 1994 to 1997 the number of marine
cases declined from 146 to 96, medical malpractice cases from 151 to
108, and personal injury cases dealing with motor vehicles from 318 to
278 cases.

Trial terminations

Federal civil trial cases can be decided by either a jury comprised of 6
to 12 members (jury trial) or a Federal judge or magistrate judge (bench
trial).  The plaintiff or the defendant may request the case be decided
by a jury trial.  If no request for a jury trial is made by either
party, the case is tried by a bench trial.  However, in most cases in
which the United States is named as the defendant, Federal law
stipulates that only a bench trial is allowed.  (Title 28 U.S.C. Section 
2402.)   Jury verdicts in a Federal civil case must be unanimous and
cannot be taken from a jury of fewer than six members.

Jury or bench trial?

Three-quarters of tort trial cases terminated in U.S. district courts
were decided by a jury trial and a quarter by a bench trial during
fiscal years 1996-97 (table 6).  The balance of jury trials differed
across case jurisdiction.  The majority of diversity of citizenship
(88%) and Federal question (63%) cases were decided by a jury trial,
while 67% of cases involving the U.S. Government as a plaintiff and 92%
as a defendant were decided by a bench trial.  The type of trial
termination differed according to the nature of the case (table 7). 
Jury trials were held in three-quarters of personal injury cases
compared to just over half of property damage cases.  About 90% of
personal injury product liability cases were disposed of by jury trial. 
Bench trials decided 43% of property damage cases compared to 24% of
personal injury cases.

Trial winners and awards 

During fiscal years 1996-97, plaintiffs won in 45% of all trial cases
decided in U.S. district courts (table 8).  Plaintiffs, however, won in
54% of property damage cases compared to 44% of personal injury cases. 
Plaintiffs won most often (71%) in cases involving Federal employers'
liability but least often (23%) in personal injury cases dealing with
the product liability of motor vehicles.

Tort cases typically involved a compensatory award for economic damages. 
This includes all financial losses resulting from the defendant's
conduct.  Tort cases also can include a compensatory award for
noneconomic damages such as pain, suffering, and emotional distress.

Distinct from compensatory damages are punitive damages.  Punitive
damages are reserved, almost exclusively, for tort claims in which the
defendant's conduct was grossly negligent or intentional.  In the tables
and text presented below, award amounts include compensatory and
punitive damages.  Because of the nature of the data, the award amounts
for each type of damage cannot be identified separately.  Additionally,
information presented is for tort cases in which the judgment was a
monetary award for damages.  Tort trial cases awarding court costs only
or court costs and attorney fees were excluded from the award analysis. 

In 86% or 1,073 of tort trial cases in which plaintiffs won, the jury or
court awarded damages. This varied little across the type of case. 
Plaintiff winners were awarded damages in 87% of personal injury cases
and 78% of property damage cases.  In 84% of the medical malpractice
cases, 88% of personal injury motor vehicle cases, and 82% of fraud
cases, plaintiff winners were awarded damages.

The median award for all tort cases was $141,000.  The median differed,
however, by type of case.  Among plaintiff winners awarded damages, half
of those in personal injury cases received at least $136,000 and half of
those in property damage cases at least $154,000.  The median award for
plaintiff winners in personal injury motor vehicle cases was $91,000 and
product liability cases $527,000.

More than $1 million was awarded to 10% of all plaintiff winners who
received damages in tort trial cases.  Thirty-one percent of plaintiff
winners in airplane personal injury cases, 20% of personal injury
product liability, and 15% of medical malpractice cases were awarded
damages of $1 million or more.  

In 8% of tort trial cases, plaintiff winners were awarded $10 million or
more.  About 13% of plaintiffs in medical malpractice cases and personal
injury product liability cases received awards of $10 million or more
for damages.

Tort trials with the U.S. Government

The Federal Tort Claims Act governs tort actions against the U.S.
Government.  This act provides the legal mechanism for compensating
persons injured by the negligent or wrongful acts of Federal employees
committed within the scope of their employment.  An administrative claim
to the appropriate Federal agency is a prerequisite before filing suit
in U.S. district court.  If the claim is denied by the Federal agency in
writing or if the Federal agency does not make a decision about the
claim within 6 months, then the claimant can file suit in U.S. district
court.  Lawsuits under the act can only be tried by bench trial.  (Title
28 U.S.C. Section 2671-2680.)

The Torts Branch of the Civil Division within the Department of Justice
represents the United States, its agencies, and its officers sued in
tort actions.  This includes suits against the United States under the
Federal Tort Claims Act, the Public Vessels Act, all admiralty suits,
and common-law suits against individual government employees.  (Urban A.
Lester and Michael F. Noone, Litigation with the Federal Government, 3rd
edition.  Philadelphia: The American Law Institute, 1994.) 

During fiscal years 1996-97, the U.S. Government was party to 371 tort
trial cases terminated in U.S. district courts.  Six of these cases
involved the U.S. Government as a plaintiff.  The U.S. Government won
four of the six cases and received a monetary award in three of the
cases (not shown in a table).
 
The U.S. Government was a defendant in the remaining 365 tort trial
cases in which the U.S. Government was party (table 9).  These cases
were mostly personal injury cases related to motor vehicles, medical
malpractice, and other personal injury.  The U.S. Government won about
half of the cases in which it was named as a defendant.  In nine of the
tort trial cases in which the United States as a defendant won the
judgment, monetary damages were awarded.  The median award for these
cases was $70,000.

Federal question cases

During fiscal years 1996-97, U.S. district courts terminated 473 tort
trial cases that involved a Federal question.  Nine out of every ten of
these cases dealt with personal injury matters, relating particularly to
marine personal injury (165 cases) and Federal employers' liability (133
cases).  Of tort trials based on Federal question jurisdiction,
plaintiffs won in 53% or 231 cases and received monetary awards in 203
cases.  The median award among plaintiff winners in these cases was
$175,000 (table 10).

Diversity of citizenship cases

About 72% of the tort trial cases terminated in U.S. district courts
involved diversity of citizenship.  Of these 2,178 cases, about 60%
involved a U.S. citizen as the plaintiff and a U.S. business as the
defendant.  An additional 29% dealt with U.S. citizens from different
States, and about 3% were between U.S. businesses.  A foreign citizen
was the plaintiff in about 1% of diversity of citizenship cases, while a
foreign nation was the plaintiff in one case during fiscal years 1996-97
(table 11).

Plaintiffs won in 42% or 853 of diversity of citizenship cases (table
12).  Plaintiff winners received monetary awards for damages in 726 or
85% of the cases, with a median award of $135,000.  Monetary awards to
plaintiffs varied, however, across the type of case.  Among the 3
out of 12 plaintiff winners involved in asbestos cases, the median award
was $700,000.  In personal injury motor vehicle cases, the median
monetary award among 226 plaintiff winners was $100,000.  The median
plaintiff award for medical malpractice cases was $450,000, while
airplane and marine personal injury cases had median plaintiff awards of 
more than $1 million.

U. S. judicial districts varied in the proportion of diversity of
citizenship cases terminated during fiscal years 1996-97.  Among the
districts with the greatest proportion of diversity of citizenship
cases terminated were Arkansas-Western and Kansas (100%),
Missouri-Western (96%), Tennessee-Western and Arkansas-Eastern (95%),
as well as West Virginia-Northern and Louisiana-Middle (94%) (figure 3). 
Among those districts with the lowest proportion of diversity of
citizenship cases terminated were California-Southern (7%), Alaska
(14%), Washington-Western (22%) and Florida-Northern (29%).


Figure 3 data goes here.

In most States, diversity of citizenship cases accounted for between 67%
and 100% of tort trials terminated within any judicial district.  This
was true, for example, among the judicial districts located within
Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Mississippi, Georgia, and North Carolina.  

In some instances, however, U.S. judicial districts within a State
varied in their proportions of diversity of citizenship cases
terminated.  In Florida 78% of tort trial cases were terminated in the
Florida-Middle District, compared to 29% in the Florida-Northern
District.  Similarly in Louisiana, 94% of tort trial cases terminated in
the Louisiana-Middle District were diversity of citizenship cases while
48% were diversity of citizenship cases in the Louisiana-Eastern
District.

Case processing time

Tort trial cases terminated in U.S. district courts during 1996-97 went
from filing to termination in an average of 20.2 months C just over 1
1/2 years (table 13).  All 13 asbestos cases terminated in less than 2
years, as well as a large majority of personal injury motor vehicle
cases (83%) and other personal injury cases (79%).  Airplane cases
tended to have a longer case processing time.  About 1 in 10 airplane
personal injury cases took 4 or more years to terminate.  More than half
(58%) of airplane product liability cases terminated within 2 to 4
years.

Methodology

The primary source of data presented in this report is the Federal
Judicial Center's Integrated Data Base (Civil).  Data tabulations were
prepared from the BJS staff analysis of source agency data sets.  The
Federal civil tort cate-gories used in this report are based primarily
on the codes established by the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts (AOUSC).  Case level information is provided by individual
U.S. district courts, which submit data to the AOUSC.  The categories
for types of cases in this report are based on those defined by the
AOUSC.  As a result, no detailed information is available on the number
of "other personal injury" cases and "other product liability cases." 
For tort cases that involved more than one type of action filed, the
AOUSC instructs the plaintiff's attorney if the cause fits more than one
nature of suit, to select the most definitive.  It is the first nature
of the suit code that was used in the analysis for this report. 

For tort cases where more than one basis of jurisdiction applies, the
case was coded according to the highest priority jurisdiction that
applies.  Cases in which the U.S. Government is the plaintiff
have the highest priority, followed by the U.S. Government as defendant,
Federal questions, diversity of citizenship cases, then local questions. 
Calculations pertaining to winners and their award amounts were based on
cases for which the winner was known.  This differs from the 1994-95
Federal tort trial study (NCJ 165810) in which these calculations were
based on the total number of tort trial cases terminated.  Plaintiff and
defendant winner categories do not include instances where both parties
won the case.    

Definitions

After court trial -- An action disposed of after the completion of a
trial before a judge or magistrate judge.

After jury trial -- An action disposed of after the completion of a
trial before a jury.

Procedural progress at termination -- The point to which an action
progressed when it was disposed of.  When used as part of these
definitions, a trial is defined as a "contested proceeding
where evidence is introduced."   A trial is considered completed when a
verdict is returned by a jury or a decision is rendered by the court.

Tort -- A civil wrong or breach of a duty to another person, as outlined
by law.  A very common tort is negligent operation of a motor vehicle
that results in property damage and personal injury in an automobile
accident.  

U.S. Government defendant -- An action against agencies and officers of
the United States.

U.S. Government plaintiff -- An action by agencies and officers of the
United States.

Federal question cases -- Cases involving the interpretation and
application of the U.S. Constitution, acts of Congress, or treaties.

Diversity of citizenship cases -- Cases involving actions in which the
amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 between citizens or corporations
of different States; citizens or corporations of a state and citizens or
subjects or a foreign country; citizens or corporations of different
states where citizens or subjects of a foreign country are additional
parties; or a foreign state as defined in Title 28 U.S.C. Section
1603(a), as plaintiff, and citizens of a State or different States.

Local question -- cases involving non-Federal civil procedures based on
local civil law in territorial districts.
