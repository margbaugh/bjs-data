More than half (58%) of state prisoners and two-thirds (63%) of 
sentenced jail inmates met the criteria for drug dependence 
or abuse, according to data collected through the 2007 and 2008-
09 National Inmate Surveys (NIS) (figure 1). In comparison, 
approximately 5% of the total general population age 18 or older 
met the criteria for drug dependence or abuse. General 
population data come from the National Survey of Drug Use and 
Health (NSDUH) collected from 2007 to 2009 by Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration. Drug dependence and 
abuse estimates in both the NIS and NSDUH data collections were 
based on criteria specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV).*** Footnote 
1 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth 
Edition, text revision (2000). Washington. DC: American 
Psychiatric Association.*** ***Footnote 2 The fifth edition of 
the DSM (DSM-V) was published in May 2013. The DSM-IV was current 
at time of data collection.***

This report examines patterns of past drug use by different 
periods (i.e., ever used, at time of offense, month before 
arrest, and regularly used), demographics, and offense type. Drug 
data were grouped into eight categories for analysis: 
marijuana/hashish, cocaine/crack, heroin/opiates, depressants, 
stimulants, methamphetamine, hallucinogens, and inhalants. 
***Footnote 3 Depressants include barbiturates, tranquilizers, 
and Quaaludes. Stimulants include amphetamine and 
methamphetamine. Hallucinogens include LSD, PCP, and ecstasy.*** 
Alcohol and nicotine were excluded from the analysis. Prevalence 
estimates are presented for inmates who met the DSM-IV criteria 
for drug dependence or abuse and for those who participated 
in a drug abuse treatment program. All NIS data were self-
reported, and the analyses include state prisoners and sentenced 
local jail inmates.

Highlights
*************

* During 2007-09, an estimated 58% of state prisoners and 63% of 
sentenced jail inmates met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for 
drug dependence or abuse.

* Among prisoners and jail inmates, prevalence estimates for 
those who met the criteria for dependence were two to three times 
higher than for abuse. 

* The percentage of inmates who met the DSM-IV criteria was 
higher for those held for property offenses than those held for 
violent or other public order offenses.

* Lifetime drug use among the incarcerated populations was 
unchanged from 2002 to 2009.

* During 2007-09, prisoners (77%) and jail inmates (78%) reported 
having ever used marijuana/hashish, more than any other drug.

* During 2007-09, more females in prison (47%) or jail (60%) used 
drugs in the month before the current offense than males in 
prison (38%) or jail (54%).

* More non-Hispanic white than non-Hispanic black prisoners 
regularly used cocaine/crack, heroin/opiates, or 
methamphetamines.

* Among those who met the criteria for drug dependence or 
abuse, 28% of prisoners and 22% of jail inmates participated in a 
drug treatment program since admission.
*************************************************************

To facilitate comparisons between the inmate and general 
population, NSDUH data on the general population were 
standardized twice to (1) match the prison population and (2) 
match the jail population by sex, race, Hispanic origin, and age. 
(See Methodology.) In addition, the general population was 
divided into three groups that were based on self-reported 
involvement with the criminal justice system in the year prior to 
the interview: (1) no involvement, (2) under supervision 
(probation or parole), or (3) arrested. (See Methodology.)

This report combined data from the addendums of NIS-1 (2007) and 
NIS-2 (2008-09). (See Methodology.) The NIS-3 (2011-12) also 
collected drug use data, but the data were not used because of 
potential bias. For this reason, the 2007-09 data are the most 
recent data available on drug use and drug use disorders 
among inmates.

Measurement of drug dependence and abuse
********************************************** 

The National Inmate Survey (NIS) included questions to assess the 
percentage of inmates who met the Diagnostic and Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for 
drug dependence or abuse. Inmates who reported having ever 
used any drug were asked about their experiences and symptoms 
related to their drug use in the year prior to admission to the 
current facility. The DSM-IV criteria are guidelines designed to 
be used with a patient’s history and sound clinical judgment in 
order to make a diagnosis. Data presented in this report are 
based on inmate self-reports and were not validated or confirmed 
by a trained clinician or clinical interview. (See Methodology.)

The DSM-IV defines drug dependence as a maladaptive pattern 
of drug use leading to clinically significant impairment or 
distress as manifested by three or more of the following 
occurring at any time in the same 12-month period: 

1.tolerance 

2. withdrawal symptoms or drug taken to relieve 
withdrawal 

3. drug taken in larger amounts for longer periods than 
intended 

4. persistent desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or 
control drug use 

5. a lot of time is spent obtaining drugs, using them, or 
recovering from its effects
 
6. a reduction in or absence from social, occupational, or 
recreational activities

7. continued use despite adverse consequences.

Unlike the criteria for drug dependence, criteria for 
drug abuse do not include tolerance, withdrawal, or a 
pattern of compulsive use. Instead, the abuse criteria include 
only the harmful consequences of repeated use. Abuse is defined 
in the DSM-IV as a maladaptive pattern of drug use leading 
to clinically significant impairment or distress, as manifested 
by one or more of the following, occurring at any time in the 
same 12-month period: 

1. recurrent drug use resulting in a failure to fulfill 
major role obligations

2. recurrent drug use in which it is physically hazardous

3. recurrent drug-related legal problems

4. continued drug use despite having persistent or 
recurrent drug-related social problems.

For any one drug, a diagnosis of dependence takes precedence 
over a diagnosis of abuse for the same drug. This means that 
a person who meets the dependence criteria for a particular 
drug cannot meet the abuse criteria for that same drug. 
The DSM-IV states that a diagnosis of drug dependence can be 
applied to 10 drug classes: alcohol, amphetamine or similarly 
acting sympathomimetics, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, 
inhalants, nicotine, opioids, phencyclidine (PCP) or similarly 
acting arylcyclohexylamines, and sedatives. The category of 
drug abuse can apply to all of these drug classes, except 
nicotine.*** Footnote 4 The DSM-IV uses the term “classes,” which 
is not the same as the schedule of controlled substances 
established through the 1970 Controlled Substance Act (P.L. 
91-513).***

A diagnosis of drug dependence or abuse should be drug-
specific (e.g., cocaine dependence or heroin abuse) and not 
generally made based on drug use in the past year as a 
whole. However, NIS data do not permit an analysis of dependence 
or abuse symptoms by individual drug type. As such, dependence 
and abuse data presented in this report are not drug-
specific.

*********************************
Drug dependence and abuse
*********************************

During 2007-09, more than half of state 
prisoners and two-thirds of sentenced 
jail inmates met the DSM-IV criteria for 
drug dependence or abuse
***********************************************

About 58% of state prisoners and 63% of sentenced jail inmates 
during 2007-09 met the DSM-IV criteria for drug dependence 
or abuse for any drug (table 1). Among state prisoners, 42% met 
the criteria for drug dependence and 17% met the criteria 
for abuse. The percentage of state prisoners who met the criteria 
for dependence was the same as those who did not meet the 
criteria for either dependence or abuse (42% each). Sentenced 
jail inmates were about three times as likely to have met the 
criteria for drug dependence (47%) than those who met the 
criteria for abuse (16%). For sentenced jail inmates, the 
percentage of those who met the criteria for dependence (47%) was 
higher than those who did not meet the criteria for either 
dependence or abuse (37%).

Female inmates were more likely than male 
inmates to have met the DSM-IV criteria 
for drug dependence or abuse
***********************************************

Approximately 7 in 10 females in state prison (69%) or jail (72%) 
met the DSM-IV criteria for dependence or abuse, compared to 
about 6 in 10 males in prison (57%) or jail (62%) (table 2). A 
larger percentage of non-Hispanic white state prisoners (62%) and 
sentenced jail inmates (72%) met the criteria for dependence or 
abuse than non-Hispanic black inmates in prison (55%) or jail 
(57%). Hispanic inmates (58% in prison and 55% in jail) were also 
less likely than white inmates to have met the criteria. 
Approximately 26% of prisoners and 40% of sentenced jail inmates 
age 55 or older met the criteria for dependence or abuse. These 
numbers were less than the 64% of prisoners and 62% of sentenced 
jail inmates ages 18 to 24 who met the same criteria.

Inmates incarcerated for a property offense 
were more likely to have met the criteria 
for dependence or abuse than inmates 
incarcerated for other offenses
***********************************************

About 54% of state prisoners and 61% of sentenced jail inmates 
incarcerated for violent offenses met the DSM-IV criteria for 
drug dependence or abuse. This was lower than the percentage 
of prisoners and jail inmates incarcerated for property (68% of 
prisoners and 72% of jail inmates) or drug (67% and 74%) 
offenses. Among prisoners who met the criteria for drug 
dependence or abuse, there was no difference in the percentage 
incarcerated for violent offenses (54%), DWI/DUI offenses (55%), 
or other public order offenses (55%). Among jail inmates, 45% of 
those incarcerated for DWI/DUI and 51% for public order offenses 
met the criteria.

State prisoners were 12 times more likely 
than adults in the general population to have 
met the criteria for dependence or abuse
***********************************************

The NSDUH general population data included adults age 18 or older 
and were standardized to match the prison population by sex, 
race, Hispanic origin, and age. The general population was 
divided into three groups based on their self-reported 
involvement in the criminal justice system during the year prior 
to the interview: (1) no involvement, (2) under supervision 
(probation or parole) or (3) arrested. A total general population 
was also included, which combined all three groups into one 
category.

The percentage of state prisoners who met the DSM-IV criteria for 
drug dependence or abuse (58%) was 12 times higher than 
adults in the total general population (5%) and 14 times higher 
than the general population (4%) that was not criminally involved 
with the justice system (table 3). Adults in the general 
population who had been on probation or parole (12%) or who had 
been arrested in the past 12 months (19%) were more likely to 
have met the criteria for drug dependence or abuse than 
their noncriminally involved counterparts (4%).

Similar to the pattern observed among prisoners, a larger 
percentage of people in each general population group met the 
criteria for drug dependence than abuse. Among persons not 
involved in the criminal justice system, 2% met the criteria for 
drug dependence and 1% met the criteria for drug abuse. 
A larger percentage of adults on probation or parole met the 
criteria for drug dependence (10%) than abuse (3%). This 
pattern was similar for adults who were arrested: 15% met the 
criteria for drug dependence compared to 5% for abuse. 

Jail inmates were more likely to have met 
the criteria for dependence or abuse than 
those in the general population who had 
been arrested
***********************************************

Approximately two-thirds (63%) of the sentenced jail population 
met the DSM-IV criteria for either drug dependence or abuse 
(table 4). This was more than 10 times the percentage of adults 
in the standardized general population (6%), and almost 15 times 
the percentage of the noncriminally involved standardized general 
population who met the criteria for drug dependence or abuse 
(4%). The percentage of sentenced jail inmates who met the 
criteria for drug dependence (47%) was about three times 
larger than those who met the criteria for drug abuse (16%). 
This pattern was the same for the general population on probation 
or parole (11% for drug dependence and 3% for abuse) and for 
those who were arrested in the past 12 months (16% drug 
dependence and 5% for abuse).

***********************************************
Trends in lifetime and regular use of 
drugs by state prisoners and jail inmates
***********************************************

Overall drug use reported by inmates was 
unchanged from past surveys
***********************************************

Lifetime use and regular use of drugs by state prisoners and 
sentenced jail inmates remained relatively stable. During 2007-
09, an estimated 81% of persons in prisons and 84% of those in 
jail reported ever using any drug in their lifetime (table 5). 
These percentages were virtually unchanged from the 83% of 
prisoners (based on BJS’s 2004 Survey of Inmates in State 
Correctional Facilities) and 85% of sentenced jail inmates (based 
on BJS’s 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails) reported ever 
using drugs.

Since the 2002 and 2004 surveys, regular use of drugs slightly 
increased among prisoners and jail inmates during 2007-09. 
Regular use was defined as having ever used any drug once a week 
or more for at least a month. In 2004, 69% of prisoners regularly 
used drugs and in 2002, 71% of jail inmates regularly used drugs. 
These numbers were similar to 72% of prisoners and 75% of jail 
inmates who regularly used drugs during 2007-09.

More state prisoners and jail inmates 
reported they had ever used marijuana/hashish 
than any other drug
***********************************************

Among state prisoners, marijuana/hashish was the most often 
reported drug type (77%) during 2007-09, followed by 
cocaine/crack (47%). In 2004, the percentage of prisoners who had 
ever used marijuana/hashish (78%) and cocaine/crack (47%) were 
nearly the same.

Nearly 42% of prisoners during 2007-09 said they had ever used 
hallucinogens, which was up from the 33% who reported its use in 
2004. Likewise, the percentage of state prisoners who had ever 
used depressants increased from 21% in 2004 to 30% during 2007-
09. Regular use of depressants among state prisoners almost 
doubled between 2004 and 2007-09, increasing from 10% to 18%. 
Regular use of hallucinogens prior to incarceration also 
increased, from 13% in 2004 to 22% during 2007-09. 

During 2007-09, the percentages of sentenced jail inmates who had 
ever used or regularly used drugs were similar to prisoners. 
Marijuana/hashish (78%) and cocaine/crack (52%) were the most 
frequently used drugs that jail inmates had ever used. This 
pattern did not change from 2002. Between 2002 and 2007-09, a 
larger percentage of jail inmates reported ever using 
heroin/opiates (21% in 2002 and 28% during 2007-09), depressants 
(22% and 34%), stimulants (29% and 34%), and hallucinogens (34% 
and 46%).

An estimated 75% of sentenced jail inmates reported regular use 
of any drug during 2007-09, compared to 70% in 2002. The 
percentage of jail inmates who regularly used a drug increased 
across all but one drug type from 2002 to 2007-09. About 39% of 
jail inmates during 2007-09 reported regular use of 
cocaine/crack, compared to 32% of those in 2002. Regular use of 
depressants during 2007-09 by jail inmates (21%) was twice that 
of the percentage who reported the same in 2002 (11%). The 
percentage of jail inmates who reported regular use of 
heroin/opiates increased from 12% in 2002 to 19% during 2007-09, 
stimulants increased from 18% to 24%, and hallucinogens from 14% 
to 23%.

***********************************************
Patterns of drug use at time of the offense
***********************************************

4 in 10 prisoners and jail inmates used drugs 
at the time of the offense for which they were 
currently incarcerated
***********************************************

During 2007-09, about 4 in 10 state prisoners (42%) and sentenced 
jail inmates (37%) said they used drugs at the time of the 
offense for which they were currently incarcerated (table 6). 
Among prisoners, 22% reported marijuana/hashish use at time of 
the offense, 16% reported cocaine/crack use, 11% reported 
stimulant use, and 7% reported heroin/opiate use. Among sentenced 
jail inmates, 19% reported using marijuana/hashish at time of the 
offense, 13% reported cocaine/crack use, and 8% reported 
stimulant and heroin/opiate use.

About 4 in 10 state prisoners and sentenced 
jail inmates who were incarcerated for property 
offenses committed the crime to get money for 
drugs or to obtain drugs
***********************************************

About 21% each of state prisoners and sentenced jail inmates said 
their most serious current offense was committed to get money for 
drugs or to obtain drugs (table 7). A larger percentage of 
prisoners (39%) and jail inmates (37%) held for property offenses 
said they committed the crime for money for drugs or drugs than 
other offense types. Nearly a third of drug offenders (30% of 
state prisoners and 29% of jail inmates) said they committed the 
offense to get drugs or money for drugs. Approximately 1 in 6 
state prisoners (15%) and jail inmates (14%) who committed 
violent offenses said they did so to get money for drugs or to 
obtain drugs.

***********************************************
Drug use by demographics and offense
***********************************************

Among state prisoners, females, whites, and 
those age 54 or younger were more likely than 
other persons to have used drugs in the month 
before the offense
***********************************************

About 39% of state prisoners during 2007-09 used drugs in the 
month before the offense, and 42% used drugs at the time of 
offense (table 8). For both 2004 and 2007-09, reference periods, 
female prisoners were more likely to have used drugs than their 
male counterparts. An estimated 47% of females used drugs in the 
month before and 49% at the time of the offense, compared to 38% 
of males who used drugs in the month before and 41% at time of 
the offense.

Black and Hispanic prisoners were less likely than white 
prisoners to report drug use in the month before or at the time 
of the offense. The percentage of prisoners who reported drug use 
in the month before the offense declined with age. About 47% of 
prisoners ages 18 to 24 used drugs in the month before the 
offense, compared to 36% of those ages 45 to 54 and 16% of those 
55 or older. Drug use at the time of the offense varied less 
across age groups, with about 42% to 45% of prisoners age 54 or 
younger reporting use. However, prisoners age 55 or older were 
significantly less likely to have used drugs at time of the 
offense (19%) than prisoners of other age groups.

State prisoners incarcerated for property or 
drug offenses were more likely to have used 
drugs than those who committed violent offenses
***********************************************

During 2007-09, state prisoners whose most serious current 
offense was a violent offense were less likely to have used drugs 
in the month before the offense (34%) than those incarcerated for 
a property crime (47%), drug offense (47%), or public order 
offense (44%).

Four in 10 (40%) prisoners incarcerated for violent crimes said 
they used a drug at time of the offense. This was lower than the 
percentage of prisoners incarcerated for a property offense (50%) 
or a drug offense (50%) but more than the percentage incarcerated 
for a DWI/DUI (28%) or other public order offense (29%).

Female jail inmates were more likely than male 
inmates to have used drugs in the month before 
the offense or at the time of the offense 
***********************************************

More than half (54%) of sentenced jail inmates during 2007-09 
used a drug in the month before the offense. About 37% used a 
drug at the time of the offense. Much like the demographic 
profile of state prisoners, a larger percentage of females than 
males in jail reported drug use in the month before the offense 
or at the time of the offense. Sentenced jail inmates who were 
black, Hispanic, or of other races were less likely than white 
inmates to report drug use in the month before or at the time of 
the offense. About 61% of sentenced jail inmates ages 18 to 24 
used drugs in the month before their offense, and this percentage 
decreased among older groups. In comparison, fewer jail inmates 
ages 18 to 24 used drugs at the time of the offense (36%) than 
those ages 25 to 34 (41%) and 35 to 44 (40%).

More than half of sentenced jail inmates 
incarcerated for a drug crime used drugs 
at the time of the offense
***********************************************

When assessed by offense type, sentenced jail inmates had a 
similar pattern of drug use in the month before the offense. 
About 2 in 3 jail inmates incarcerated for property offenses 
(63%) or drug offenses (67%) used drugs in the month before the 
offense. These percentages were higher than that of jail inmates 
(54%) who were incarcerated for a violent offense and used drugs 
in the month before arrest. Jail inmates incarcerated for DWI/DUI 
(24%) or other public order offenses (43%) were the least likely 
to have used drugs in the month before the offense. A smaller 
percentage of inmates incarcerated for violent offenses (37%) 
than for property (46%) or drug (51%) offenses used drugs at the 
time of the offense.

***********************************************
Regular use of cocaine/crack, methamphetamine, 
or heroin/opiates by demographics
***********************************************

Patterns of regular drug use differed by race and Hispanic 
origin. White inmates in prison or jail were more likely than 
black or Hispanic inmates to have regularly used any drug. Black 
prisoners were the least likely to have regularly used 
cocaine/crack (28%), compared to whites (42%) and Hispanics (31%) 
(figure 2). Among jail inmates, 31% of blacks, 47% of whites, and 
29% of Hispanics regularly used cocaine/crack (figure 3). Black 
inmates were the least likely among prisoners and jail inmates to 
report regular use of methamphetamine or heroin/opiates.

Cocaine/crack
***************

During 2007-09, regular use of cocaine/crack 
was highest among females, whites, inmates 
ages 35 to 44, and property offenders
***********************************************

Almost half of female state prisoners (49%) and sentenced jail 
inmates (48%) regularly used cocaine/crack (table 9). Among male 
inmates, 31% of those in prison and 36% of those in jail 
regularly used cocaine/crack.

Regular use of cocaine/crack was highest among inmates ages 45 to 
54 (42% of state prisoners and 52% of jail inmates). A quarter of 
prisoners (26%) and jail inmates (24%) ages 18 to 24 said they 
regularly used cocaine/crack.

A larger percentage of state prisoners incarcerated for property 
(45%) or drug (37%) offenses than violent offenses (29%) said 
they regularly used cocaine/crack. Among sentenced jail inmates, 
48% of those incarcerated for property offenses, 43% for drug 
offenses, and 34% for violent offenses reported regular use of 
cocaine/crack during 2002-09.

Methamphetamine
*****************

Female inmates were more likely than male 
inmates to have regularly used methamphetamine 
during 2007-09
***********************************************

Among both prisoners and jail inmates, a larger percentage of 
females (31% for prison and 26% for jail) than males (17% each) 
reported regular use of methamphetamine (table 10).

About 19% of prisoners in each age group age 54 or younger 
reported regular use of methamphetamine, compared to 8% of 
prisoners age 55 or older. Jail inmates ages 25 to 44 (21%) were 
more likely to have regularly used methamphetamine than those 
ages 18 to 24 (14%).

A higher percentage of white (34%) than black (2%) prisoners 
regularly used methamphetamine. Among jail inmates, 31% of whites 
and 3% of blacks regularly used methamphetamine. Among Hispanics 
in state prison or jail, about 19% of each population regularly 
used methamphetamine.

More state prisoners incarcerated for property offenses (28%) 
than violent offenses (14%) reported regular use of 
methamphetamine. Among sentenced jail inmates, a larger 
percentage of those incarcerated for property (24%) or drug (23%) 
offenses than violent offenses (16%) reported regular use of 
methamphetamine.

Heroin/opiates
*****************

Regular use of heroin/opiates was lowest among 
black prisoners and jail inmates during 2007-09
***********************************************

About 1 in 4 females in state prison (22%) or jail (25%) reported 
regular use of heroin/opiates, compared to about 1 in 6 males in 
prison (15%) or jail (17%) (table 11).

Twenty-two percent of both prisoners and jail inmates ages 45 to 
54 reported they regularly used heroin/opiates. These percentages 
were higher than those ages 18 to 24 who said they regularly used 
heroin/opiates among prisoners (12%) and jail inmates (14%).

Three times more whites (25%) than blacks (8%) in prison 
regularly used heroin/opiates. Almost four times more whites 
(30%) than blacks (8%) in jail regularly used heroin/opiates. 
Hispanics in prison (16%) and jail (12%) were also less likely 
than white inmates to have regularly used heroin/opiates.

Prisoners (25%) and jail inmates (24%) incarcerated for property 
offenses had higher rates of regular use of heroin/opiates than 
those incarcerated for violent offenses (13% for prisoners and 
15% for jail inmates). Seventeen percent of prisoners and 23% of 
jail inmates incarcerated for drug offenses said they regularly 
used heroin/opiates.

***********************************************
Estimates of lifetime and regular use of drugs 
among adults in the general population
***********************************************

Little to no change occurred in the percentage 
of adults in the general population who had 
ever used or regularly used drugs between 
2002-04 and 2007-09
***********************************************

During the 3-year aggregate period from 2002 to 2004, about half 
(48%) of adults in the general population said they had ever used 
drugs (figure 4). Nearly the same percentage of adults (49%) in 
the general population reported ever using any drug during 2007-
09. Among adults in the general population who had ever used 
drugs, there was little to no difference by drug type between 
reference periods. In both periods, about 44% of adults in the 
general population said they had ever used marijuana/hashish, 
compared to 16% who ever used cocaine/crack, 16% who ever used 
hallucinogens, and 15% who ever used heroin/opiates. 
Methamphetamine was the least reported, with 5% of adults in the 
general population who said they had ever used the drug.

There was virtually no variation observed between 2002-04 and 
2007-09 in the percentage of adults in the general population who 
reported regular use of drugs (figure 5). For the adult general 
population, regular use was defined as use of any drug at least 
once in the past month prior to the interview. During 2007-09, 
fewer than 1 in 10 (8%) adults in the general population reported 
regular use of drugs.

Month-before drug use among prisoners was three 
times higher than the general population
***********************************************

Drug use for the month-before reference period was defined 
differently for the general population and inmates. For the 
general population, it was the percentage who reported drug use 
in the month before the interview. For both prisoners and jail 
inmates, it was the percentage who said they used drugs in the 
month before their arrest.

During 2007-09, the percentage of prisoners (39%) who reported 
drug use in the month before arrest was more than three times 
higher than the standardized adult general population (12%) and 
five times higher than the unstandardized adult general 
population (8%) (table 12). Twenty-four percent of the general 
population on probation or parole and 32% of those who were 
arrested in the past year reported drug use in the past month.

For almost every drug type, prisoners were significantly more 
likely than adults in the general population to have used it in 
the month before the arrest or interview. However, the exceptions 
were adults in the general population who were arrested in the 
past year. They were as likely as prisoners to have used 
marijuana/hashish (27%) and heroin/opiates (7%) in the month 
before the interview.

Among prisoners and adults in the general 
population, marijuana/hashish was reported 
as the most used drug in the month before 
the arrest or interview
***********************************************

State prisoners (28%) and adults in the general population (10%) 
reported more past month use of marijuana/hashish than any other 
drug. However, prisoners reported cocaine/crack (15%) as the 
second most used drug in the month before. Adults in the general 
population reported heroin/opiates (2%) as the second most 
reported drug used in the month before. 

The use of stimulants in the month before was higher among 
prisoners (10%) than adults in the general population (0.4%) and 
those with no past year criminal justice involvement (0.4%). 
Stimulant use was also higher among prisoners than among adults 
in the general population on probation or parole (2%) and those 
who had been arrested (2%).

Sentenced jail inmates were more likely than 
the general population to have used drugs in 
the prior month
***********************************************

During 2007-09, more than half (55%) of sentenced jail inmates 
used drugs in the month before the arrest (table 13). This 
compares to 12% of adults in the standardized general population 
with no criminal justice involvement, 14% of adults in the 
standardized general population, 27% of those on probation or 
parole, and 35% of those who had been arrested in the past year.

Across all drug types, sentenced jail inmates were more likely 
than adults in the general population to have used the drug in 
the month prior to their interview. This pattern also held for 
each subgroup of adults in the general population by criminal 
justice involvement.

Compared to the standardized total general population, sentenced 
jail inmates were more likely to have reported past month 
stimulant use (12% for jail inmates and 1% for the general 
population), to have used cocaine/crack (21% and 1%), and to have 
used depressants (12% and 1%).

***********************************************
Participation in drug treatment programs
***********************************************

Fewer than a third of inmates who met the 
criteria for drug dependence or abuse 
received drug treatment or participated in 
a program
***********************************************

Among inmates who met the DSM-IV criteria for drug 
dependence or abuse, 28% of prisoners and 22% of jail inmates 
said they received drug treatment or participated in a program 
since admission to the current facility (table 14). However, 
inmates may have participated in or received more than one type 
of treatment program. Nineteen percent of those in prison said 
they participated in a self-help group or peer counseling, 15% 
were in a drug education program, 10% were placed in a 
residential facility or unit, and 6% received drug-related 
counseling by a professional. In comparison, about 12% of 
sentenced jail inmates who met the DSM-IV criteria participated 
in a self-help group or peer counseling, 8% were in a drug 
education program, 8% were placed in a residential facility or 
unit, and 6% received drug-related counseling by a professional.

Prisoner and jail inmate participation in a 
drug treatment program did not differ by time 
since arrival to the current facility or 
time until release
***********************************************

Prisoner and jail inmate participation in a drug treatment 
program was assessed by time spent in the current facility since 
arrival and expected time left until release. Among prisoners who 
met the criteria for dependence or abuse and had been in the 
current facility for 6 months or less, 60% received or 
participated in a drug treatment program during 2007-09 (table 
15). Of those prisoners who met the criteria for dependence or 
abuse and had 12 months or less before release, 64% said they had 
participated in a drug treatment program.

Among sentenced jail inmates who met the criteria for dependence 
or abuse and had been in the current facility for 6 months or 
less, 63% participated in a drug treatment program. The same 
percentage of jail inmates who met the criteria and had 12 months 
or less until release participated in a drug treatment program 
(63%).

More inmates who met the criteria for 
dependence or abuse participated in a drug 
treatment program than adults in the 
general population
***********************************************

An estimated 11% of adults in the general population who met the 
DSM-IV criteria for drug dependence or abuse received or 
participated in a drug treatment program in the past 12 months 
prior to the interview (table 16). (See Methodology.) Among 
adults in the general population who met the criteria for 
dependence or abuse, criminal justice involvement increased the 
likelihood of past year participation in a drug treatment 
program. When standardized to match the prison population by sex, 
race, Hispanic origin, and age, about 8% of adults in the general 
population who met the criteria for dependence or abuse and had 
no past year criminal justice involvement received or 
participated in a drug treatment program in the past year. In 
comparison, 35% of the probation or parole population and 30% of 
those arrested in the past year were in a drug treatment program.

Adults in the general population who met the criteria for 
dependence or abuse and who participated in a drug treatment 
program in the past year reported more often that it was a self-
help group compared to other treatment program type. When 
standardized to match the prison population by sex, race, 
Hispanic origin, and age, 30% of those on probation or parole, 
23% of those who were arrested, 10% of adults in the total 
general population, and 5% of noncriminally justice-involved 
adults in the past year reported they had attended a self-help 
group. Of those adults who met the criteria for dependence or 
abuse and participated in a drug treatment program in the past 
year, 5% of those on probation or parole and 4% of those who were 
arrested reported that the location of this drug treatment 
program was in a prison or jail.

Methodology
**************

***********************************************
National Inmate Surveys, 2007 and 2008-09
***********************************************

Estimates produced for this report are based on survey responses 
from the National Inmate Survey, 2007 (NIS-1) and the National 
Inmate Survey, 2008-09 (NIS-2). The NIS-1 was conducted in 127 
state prisons, 14 federal prisons, and 282 local jails between 
April and December 2007. The NIS-2 was conducted in 148 state 
prisons, 19 federal prisons, 286 local jails, and 10 special 
facilities (military, Indian country, and Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE)) between October 2008 and December 2009. RTI 
International, under a cooperative agreement with the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics (BJS), collected the data for both 
collections.

The NIS-1 and NIS-2 administered two questionnaires to inmates: 
(1) a survey about sexual victimization while incarcerated and 
(2) a survey about prior drug and alcohol use, drug 
dependence and abuse symptoms, and treatment for drug 
dependence or abuse. Inmates were randomly assigned to receive 
one of the two questionnaires, so that at the time of the 
interview, the content of the survey remained unknown to facility 
staff and the interviewers.

A total of 71,571 inmates participated in NIS-1 and 81,566 
inmates participated in NIS-2 receiving either the sexual 
victimization survey or the randomly assigned companion survey. 
In NIS-1, the surveys were administered to 22,943 inmates in 
state prisons, 3,214 federal prisons, and 45,414 inmates in 
jails. In NIS-2, the surveys were administered to 28,749 state 
prisoners, 3,280 federal prisoners, 48,066 inmates in jails, and 
1,471 inmates in special facilities.

The interviews, which averaged 30 minutes, used computer-assisted 
personal interviewing (CAPI) and audio computer-assisted self-
interviewing (ACASI) data collection methods. In both surveys, 
interviewers conducted a personal interview using CAPI to obtain 
background information and date of administration. For the 
remainder of the interview, inmates interacted with a computer 
administered questionnaire using a touchscreen and synchronized 
audio instructions delivered via headphones. Respondents 
completed the ACASI portion of the interview in private, with the 
interviewer either leaving the room or moving away from the 
computer. ACASI administration helped to elicit more candid 
responses on sensitive subjects and behaviors, eliminated 
literacy issues, and protected respondents’ privacy. While 
underreporting of behaviors may exist, the relative extent is 
unknown.

A shorter paper questionnaire (PAPI) was made available for 
inmates who were unable to come to the private interviewing room 
or interact with the computer. The paper form was completed by 
530 NIS-1 and 496 NIS-2 prisoners (or 2.0% for NIS-1 and 1.5% for 
NIS-2 prisoner interviews) and 233 NIS-1 and 226 NIS-2 jail 
inmates (0.5% of all jail inmate interviews in both NIS-1 and 
NIS-2). Inmates who completed the PAPI were not asked about their 
prior drug and alcohol use or treatment for drug abuse.

Additional information on the methodology for sample selection of 
facilities and inmates can be found in Sexual Victimization in 
Local Jails Reported by Inmates, 2007 (NCJ 221946, BJS web, June 
2008), Sexual Victimization in State and Federal Prisons Reported 
by Inmates, 2007 (NCJ 219414, BJS web, December 2007), and Sexual 
Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2008-09 
(NCJ 231169, BJS web, August 2010).

In this report, the analysis of past drug use, drug 
dependence and abuse symptoms, and treatment was restricted to 
adult state prisoners or jail inmates. Inmates in federal 
prisons, military, Indian country, or ICE facilities were 
excluded from this report.

***********************************************
Measurement of prior drug use and drug 
abuse treatment
***********************************************

Prior drug use, drug dependence and abuse symptoms, and 
treatment modules were administered to participating inmates in 
the NIS-1 and NIS-2 for one of two reasons:

1. To ensure the survey length was similar for all 
participating prisoners and jail inmates regardless of 
whether they had experienced a victimization.

2. As part of the alternative survey, the drug use questions 
consisted of an initial screener asking about each type of 
drug a prisoner or jail inmate may have used in their 
lifetime prior to incarceration. For each drug that an 
inmate had used, follow-up questions were asked about the 
frequency of use and periods in which the inmate used the 
drug (e.g., month prior to the offense, at the time of the 
offense).

Questions on past drug use consisted of an initial screener 
asking about eight types of drugs a prisoner or jail inmate may 
have ever used in their lifetime: marijuana/hashish, 
cocaine/crack, heroin/opiates, depressants, stimulants, 
methamphetamine, hallucinogens, and inhalants. For each drug that 
an inmate said they had ever used, follow-up questions were asked 
about the frequency in which each drug was used and periods in 
which the inmate used the drug (e.g., month prior to the offense 
or at the time of the offense).

Prisoners and jail inmates who met the drug dependence or 
abuse criteria were asked if they had attended any kind of drug 
treatment program since admission to the current facility. Drug 
treatment programs were defined as (1) spending time in a special 
facility or unit, (2) counseling with a trained professional 
while not living in a special facility or unit, (3) spending up 
to 72 hours in a detoxification unit to dry out, (4) receiving a 
maintenance drug to cut the high or to make you sick (e.g., 
methadone), (5) self-help or peer group counseling (e.g., 
Narcotics Anonymous), or (6) an education or awareness program 
that explained the problems with drug use.

Among prisoners and jail inmates who received the sexual 
victimization survey (90% of inmates surveyed in NIS-1 and 95% of 
inmates surveyed in NIS-2), inmates received the prior drug use, 
dependence and abuse symptoms, and treatment components only if 
they completed the sexual victimization modules in less than 30 
minutes. Based on this criterion, 38,008 state prisoners received 
the past drug use and drug abuse treatment modules (80% of 
sexual victimization survey prison respondents). Among jail 
respondents, 73,396 inmates received the past drug use and 
drug abuse treatment modules (86% of jail sexual 
victimization survey respondents).

A total of 3,432 state prisoners and 6,577 jail inmates 
were randomized to the alternative survey. This constituted 10% 
of NIS-1 respondents and 5% of NIS-2 respondents. These prisoners 
and jail inmates received the full set of past drug use, 
dependence and abuse symptoms, and treatment modules.

***********************************************
Measurement of drug dependence and abuse
***********************************************

To determine if a prisoner or jail inmate met the criteria for 
drug dependence or abuse, a series of questions was modeled 
after the DSM-IV criteria and included on the NIS surveys. The 
following NIS questions were used to assess drug dependence 
with the corresponding DSM-IV criteria category in parentheses. A 
positive response to three or more of the items indicated that a 
prisoner or jail inmate likely met the DSM-IV criteria for 
dependence.

During the year before you were admitted to the current 
facility--

1. Did your usual amount of drugs have less effect on you than 
it once did or did you have to use more to get the effect 
you wanted? (tolerance)

2. Did you experience some of the bad after-effects of using 
drugs after cutting down or stopping your drug use—like 
shaking, feeling nervous or anxious, sick to your stomach, 
restless, sweating, or having trouble sleeping or fits or 
seizures, or see, feel, or hear things that weren’t really 
there? (withdrawal-a)

3. Did you ever keep using drugs to get over any of the bad 
after-effects of a drug or to keep from having bad after-
effects? (withdrawal-b)

4. Did you often use a drug in larger amounts or for longer 
periods than you meant to? (compulsive use)

5. Did you more than once want to cut down on your drug use or 
try to cut down on your drug use but found you couldn’t do 
it? (impaired control)

6. Did you spend a lot of time getting drugs, using them, or 
getting over the bad after-effects? (time spent)

7. Did you give up activities that you were interested in or 
that were important to you in favor of using drugs like—
work, school, hobbies, or associating with family and 
friends? (neglect of activities)

8. Did you continue to use drugs even though it was causing 
emotional or psychological problems? (continued use despite 
problems-a)

9. Did you continue to use drugs even though it was causing 
physical health or medical problems? (continued use despite 
problems-b)

For each symptom, the percentage of prisoners reporting they 
experienced symptoms ranged from 31% (withdrawal) to 40% 
(continued use despite problems) (table 17). Approximately 45% of 
prisoners had no dependence symptoms, 8% had one, and 47% had two 
or more. For jail inmates, the percentage who experienced 
symptoms ranged from 37% (withdrawal, time spent obtaining and 
using, and neglect of activities) to 46% (continued use despite 
problems). Thirty-nine percent of jail inmates had no dependence 
symptoms, 8% had one, and 53% had two or more.

The following NIS questions were used to measure if a person met 
the drug abuse criteria. The corresponding DSM-IV criteria 
category follows in parentheses. A positive response to one or 
more of the items, in conjunction with fewer than three positive 
responses to the dependence items, indicated that a prisoner or 
jail inmate was likely to have met the criteria for drug 
abuse.

During the year before you were admitted to the current this 
facility--

1. Did you lose a job because of your drug use? (failure to 
fulfill obligations-a)

2. Did you have job or school trouble because of your drug 
use, like missing too much work, not doing your work well, 
being demoted at work, or dropping out of school? (failure 
to fulfill obligations-b)

3. Did using drugs or being sick from using drugs keep you 
from doing work, going to school, or caring for children? 
(failure to fulfill obligations-c)

4. Did you get into situations while using drugs or just after 
using drugs that increased your chances of getting hurt—
like driving a car or other vehicle, swimming, using 
machinery, or walking in a dangerous area or around 
traffic? (use in hazardous situations)

5. Did you get arrested or held at a police station because of 
your drug use? (legal problems)

6. Did you have arguments with your spouse, boyfriend or 
girlfriend, family, or friends while under the influence of 
a drug? (social problems-a)

7. Did you get into a physical fight while under the influence 
of a drug? (social problems-b)

8. Did you continue to use drugs even though it was causing 
problems with family, friends, or work?” (social problems-c)

For each abuse symptom, the percentage of prisoners reporting 
they experienced symptoms ranged from 28% (legal problems) to 52% 
(social problems) (table 18). Approximately 43% of prisoners had 
no abuse symptoms, 14% had one, and 43% had two or more. Among 
jail inmates, the percentage who met each abuse symptoms ranged 
from 31% (use in hazardous situations) to 56% (social problems). 
Thirty-eight percent had no symptoms, 14% had one, and 48% had 
two or more.

*****************************
Nonresponse bias analysis
*****************************

Bias occurs when the estimated prevalence of an outcome is 
different from the actual prevalence of the outcome for a given 
facility. One potential source of bias is nonresponse. A 
nonresponse bias analysis was conducted to determine if prisoners 
or jail inmates who did not receive the past drug use, alcohol, 
and drug abuse treatment modules were different from those 
who did.

Among the sexual victimization survey respondents, there were two 
potential sources for nonresponse bias. First, due to time 
limitations in the survey, about 20% of ACASI state prison 
respondents and 16% of ACASI jail respondents did not receive the 
drug, alcohol, and treatment modules. These respondents were more 
likely to have indicated a sexual victimization. While these 
percentages were large, it was determined to be possible to 
adjust for this potential bias through a post-survey weight 
adjustment (see section on Weighting and nonresponse 
adjustments). Second, prisoners or jail inmates who took the 
survey via PAPI did not receive the past drug use, dependence, or 
abuse symptoms, or treatment modules. The sexual assault survey 
PAPI respondents were found to have a higher prevalence of sexual 
victimization. Given that the PAPI respondents made up 1.8% of 
prison respondents and 0.5% of jail respondents across the 
combined survey years, it was determined that a weight adjustment 
could reduce the potential bias due to PAPI respondents not being 
asked the past drug use and drug abuse items.

For the alternative survey, since all respondents completed the 
survey via ACASI, there was no potential for bias due to the mode 
of the interview.

***********************************************
Weighting and nonresponse adjustments
***********************************************

Responses from interviewed prisoners and jail inmates were 
weighted to produce national-level estimates. Each interviewed 
inmate was assigned an initial weight corresponding to the 
inverse of the probability of selection within each sampled 
facility. A series of adjustment factors was applied to the 
initial weight to minimize potential bias due to nonresponse and 
to provide national estimates:

1. The adjustment of overall survey nonresponse is described 
in detail in Sexual Victimization in Local Jails Reported 
by Inmates, 2007 (NCJ 221946, BJS web, June 2008), Sexual 
Victimization in State and Federal Prisons Reported by 
Inmates, 2007 (NCJ 219414, BJS web, December 2007), and 
Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by 
Inmates, 2008-09 (NCJ 231169, BJS web, August 2010).

2. A second weighting adjustment was conducted to account for 
the potential bias due to survey mode nonresponse among the 
sexual victimization survey respondents. Bias could result 
if the PAPI respondents were different from the ACASI 
respondents. Because PAPI respondents received only the 
sexual victimization survey, this adjustment was not 
applied to alternative survey respondents. The adjustment 
for mode nonresponse included a calibration of the weights 
so that the weight from a PAPI respondent was assigned to 
an ACASI respondent with similar characteristics. Since 
both ACASI and PAPI respondents provided demographic and 
criminal history information, these data were used in 
weight adjustment. For each inmate, these adjustments were 
based on a generalized exponential model developed by 
Folsom and Singh (2002), and applied to the sexual 
victimization survey respondents. ***Footnote 5 Folsom, 
Jr., R.E., and Singh, A.C. (2002). The generalized 
exponential model for sampling weight calibration for 
extreme values, nonresponse, and poststratification. 
Proceedings of the American Statistical Association, Survey 
Research Methods Section, pp. 598–603.***

3. A third adjustment corrected for module nonresponse. Sexual 
victimization survey respondents who did not complete the 
sexual victimization modules within 30 minutes and, 
therefore, did not receive the past drug use or drug 
abuse treatment modules were considered nonrespondents. 
Because alternative survey respondents did not have a 
similar time constraint, this adjustment was not applied to 
inmates randomized to the alternative survey.

The module nonresponse adjustment included a calibration of the 
weights so that the weight from a past drug use and drug 
abuse treatment module nonrespondent was assigned to a responding 
prisoner or jail inmate with similar characteristics. The 
adjustment used data from modules that both groups completed, 
including demographic, criminal history, sexual victimization, 
and interview debriefing characteristics. This adjustment ensured 
that the estimates accurately reflected the full sample, rather 
than only the prisoners and jail inmates who responded to the 
past drug use or drug abuse treatment modules. For each 
inmate, these adjustments were based on a generalized exponential 
model and applied to the sexual victimization survey respondents.

The survey mode and module nonresponse adjustments maintained the 
control totals designed to provide national-level estimates for 
the number of prisoners and jail inmates age 18 or older who were 
held in jails at midyear 2007 for NIS-1 and 2009 for NIS-2, or in 
prison at yearend in 2007 and 2009.***Footnote 6 In NIS-1 the 
state inmate population was not benchmarked to the National 
Prisoner Statistics.*** The totals estimated the number of 
prisoners and jail inmates by sex during the survey period. 
These totals came from BJS’s Annual Survey of Jails and National 
Prisoner Statistics Program for local jail and state prison 
respondents. In 2007, the national estimates for local jails 
(with an average daily population of six or more inmates) were 
673,005 males and 99,810 females. In 2009, the national estimates 
for state prisons were 1,178,916 adult males and 88,518 adult 
females. For jails with an average daily population of six or 
more inmates, estimates included 678,136 adult males and 99,096 
adult females.

4. A fourth adjustment corrected survey weights to account for 
the combining of multiple survey years to allow survey 
totals to represent the average number of prisoners or jail 
inmates across the survey years included in the analytic 
file. The weight adjustment was produced by dividing the 
mode nonresponse adjusted weights by the number of survey 
years being combined—in this case 2 years.

5. A final adjustment was applied to combine data from the 
sexual victimization survey and the alternative survey. For 
this adjustment, the weight for each responding prisoner or 
jail inmate was multiplied by the probability of receiving 
the survey type received. In NIS-1 the survey nonresponse 
and mode nonresponse adjusted weight for the ACASI 
respondents were multiplied by 0.90 for the sexual 
victimization survey and by 0.10 for respondents to the 
alternative survey. In NIS-2 the survey nonresponse and 
mode nonresponse adjusted weight for the ACASI respondents 
were multiplied by 0.95 in the sexual victimization survey 
and 0.05 for respondents to the alternative survey.

***********************************************
Standard errors and tests of significance
***********************************************

As with any survey, the NIS estimates are subject to error 
arising from their basis on a sample rather than a complete 
enumeration of the population of adult inmates in prisons and 
jails. For past drug use, dependence and abuse symptoms, and 
treatment outcomes, the estimated sampling error varies by the 
size of the estimate, by the number of completed interviews, and 
by the intracluster correlation of the outcome within facilities.

A common way to express this sampling variability is to construct 
a 95% confidence interval around each survey estimate. Typically, 
multiplying the standard error by 1.96 and then adding or 
subtracting the result from the estimate produces the confidence 
interval. This interval expresses the range of values that could 
result among 95% of the different samples that could be drawn.

To facilitate the analysis, differences in the estimates of 
sexual victimization for subgroups in these tables have been 
tested and notated for significance at the 95% confidence level. 
For example, the difference in the percentage of state prisoners 
who reported ever using heroin/opiates during 2007-09 compared to 
state prisoners and jail inmates in 2004 is statistically 
significant at the 95% confidence level (table 1). In all tables 
providing detailed comparisons, statistically significant 
differences at the 95% level of confidence or greater have been 
designated with two asterisks (**) when comparing two different 
population types (e.g., persons in prison and persons in the 
general population).

***********************************************
Comparing NIS estimates to prior prisoner 
and jail inmate surveys
***********************************************

In analyzing past drug use, dependence and abuse symptoms, and 
treatment among jail inmates, the analysis was restricted to 
sentenced jail inmates. The jail population was restricted to be 
comparable to the Survey of Inmates in Local Jail surveys. The 
prior survey was restricted to sentenced jail inmates to ensure 
the respondent would meet the minimum time in the facility to be 
eligible for the survey, and also to increase the likelihood that 
the jail respondents would be eligible to have access to 
treatment services while in jail.

The NIS estimates on drug dependence and abuse and drug 
abuse treatment were not compared to prior inmate surveys (e.g., 
2004 Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities and 2002 
Survey of Inmates in Local Jails) for two reasons. First, the NIS 
used a different data collection mode from the prior inmate 
surveys. The NIS used ACASI for the drug dependence and 
abuse criteria and drug abuse treatment modules. The prior 
prisoner and jail inmate surveys used CAPI for these modules. 
Second, prior prisoner and jail inmate surveys asked about drug 
use during the “past month since the inmate’s current 
incarceration.” However, the NIS asked about drug use during the 
“past month since admission to the current facility.” Some 
prisoners or jail inmates may have been in a different facility--
either another prison or a local jail-during the prior month to 
admission to their current facility.

These mode and measurement differences may confound any 
differences found when comparing estimates over time. In other 
words, any differences between prior surveys and the NIS may be 
due to changes over time or due to measurement and mode 
differences. Therefore, it is difficult to make confident 
statements regarding change. Furthermore, the measurement and 
mode differences impact the NIS estimates in different ways. As 
noted, ACASI is expected to yield higher estimates than CAPI. 
However, the instrument wording changes in the NIS likely 
suppress the past month drug use estimate because inmates did not 
have access to drugs while in another facility. The magnitude of 
each of these differences is not known, which makes comparisons 
with past surveys that used different methodologies and question 
wording difficult.

***********************************************
Drug use in the general population
***********************************************

Drug use estimates in the general population come from to the 
NSDUH. To be most comparable to the prisoner and jail inmate 
population included in the NIS, the NSDUH 2007-2009 survey years 
were used in this analysis.

Using indicators provided in the NSDUH survey, the general 
population was split into three groups: (1) persons not involved 
in the criminal justice system during the past 12 months, (2) 
those on probation or parole during the past 12 months, and (3) 
those arrested in the past 12 months. These groups are not 
mutually exclusive in that a person can be both on probation or 
parole and arrested in the past 12 months. For 2007-09, 1% of 
respondents said they were on probation or parole and had been 
arrested in the past 12 months. These persons are represented in 
both criminal justice categories. Persons in the general 
population on probation and parole or arrested in the past 12 
months should be more similar to the prisoner and jail inmate 
population than those never involved with the criminal justice 
system during the past 12 months. Figure 1 and tables 4, 5, 9, 
10, and 14 compare the inmate population in prisons and jails to 
the general population.

***********************************************
Standardization of general population estimates
***********************************************

When comparing two populations, differences found for some 
characteristics or conditions may be statistically different as a 
result of a true difference in the populations or due to basic 
demographic differences that are associated with the outcome of 
interest. One method to determine if these demographic 
differences are the sole cause for differences found for other 
characteristics or conditions is to standardize the estimates.

Standardization of survey estimates consists of calibrating the 
survey weights for one population such that, for key demographic 
characteristics that are known for each population, the 
distributions are identical. This process was done using the 
statistical software SUDAAN’s PROC DESCRIPT procedure. The 
resulting estimates are not a representation of the standardized 
population by themselves (i.e., generalizations about the 
population cannot be made from standardized estimates), but are 
appropriate estimates for comparison with other populations of 
interest.

In this report, estimates were standardized for each of the three 
general population types. For each general population type, 
estimates were standardized to the prisoner and jail inmate 
population’s distribution by sex, race and Hispanic origin, and 
age. Because the prison and jail inmate populations differed, the 
general population was standardized separately to each inmate 
population (see appendix tables 3 and 4). For the general, 
noncriminally involved population, estimates were standardized to 
the inmate population’s distribution based on race and Hispanic 
origin, age, and self-reported veteran status. Tables 3 and 12 
include standardized estimates to the prison population. Tables 4 
and 13 include standardized estimates to the jail population. 
When standardization is done both the crude (unstandardized) and 
standardized estimates are presented for comparability.
