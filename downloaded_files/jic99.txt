Highlights

June 30, 1999, a total of 69 jails, detention centers, or other
correctional facilities were supervising 1,693 persons in Indian
country, an increase of 8% from the previous year.  At midyear
1998, 1,567 persons were under the supervision of jails in
Indian country.

These data are based the 1998 and 1999 Surveys of Jails in
Indian Country (SJIC).  The Survey includes all confinement
facilities, detention centers, jails, and other correctional
facilities located in Indian country and operated by tribal
authorities or the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA).  The
SJIC was initiated in 1998, as a component of the Annual Survey
of Jails (ASJ). 

69 facilities were operating in Indian country,

Tribal jurisdiction

With the assistance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BJS
identified 69 jails or detention facilities operating in 
Indian country during 1998 and 1999.  These facilities are 
affiliated with 53 different tribal reservations and located 
in 18 States. The tribes included in this report have retained 
criminal jurisdiction over crimes committed by Indians in 
Indian country. Tribal authority to imprison offenders is 
limited to sentences of 1 year or less for each offense.  
Tribes generally share jurisdiction over felony offenses 
with the Federal or State government.  See  Methodology 
for additional details.

Criminal jurisdiction in Indian country
 
Tribal jurisdiction
*  Crimes committed by Indians against
Indians in Indian country.  Sentences are 
limited to 1 year or less and a $5,000 fine.  
25 U.S.C.A Sec. 1302(7)
 
Federal or State jurisdiction
 * 14 crimes under the Major Crimes Act of
1885.  18 U.S.C.A. ' 1153
 * All crimes on tribal lands specified under
Public Law 280, 18 U.S.C.A. ' 1162
 
Note: Criminal jurisdiction in Indian country
depends on several factors, including the 
identity of the defendant, the identity of the
victim, and where the crime was committed.
See Canby, 1998.

Jails in Indian country employed 775 
persons on June 30, 1998

* The 69 facilities in Indian country employed 775 persons at
midyear 1998.  About three-fourths (573) were facility duty
staff.      

* At midyear 1998 there were 2.6 inmates for every facility duty
employee (correctional officer or other staff member supervising
inmates).  The U.S. average among small local jails (those
holding 50 inmates or fewer) was 2.0 inmates per correctional
officer in 1999. 

Most commonly reported needs of jails 
in Indian country:

-- Staff training
-- Additional correctional officers
-- New jail equipment
-- Modify space for special           
   population
-- Drug/alcohol treatment program 

*  67 of the 69 jails in Indian country reported the need 
for additional correctional officers or staff training.  

*  60 facilities reported the need to modify existing space for
a special population and the need for new jail equipment, 59
reported they were in need of drug and alcohol treatment
programs.    

Survey of Jails in Indian Country

In 1998 the Bureau of Justice Statistics initiated the Survey of
Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) as a component of the Annual
Survey of Jails (ASJ).  The SJIC, administered annually at
midyear (June 30th), is sent to confinement facilities,
detention centers, jails, and other correctional facilities
located on Indian land.  

The survey gathers information on the number of persons in
custody, the number under community supervision, offender
characteristics, and facility capacity.  In 1998, the SJIC
included a special section on facility character- istics, 
including types of confinement areas, function of the facility, 
programs offered, personnel characteristics, and facility needs.

Within the United States there are around 300 Indian land areas or
reservations located in 33 States (Utter, 1993).  Generally, the
local governing authority on an Indian reservation is a tribal
government or Council.  Jurisdiction over crimes committed on
Indian land depends on several factors, including the identity
of the victim, the identity of the offender, the severity of the
crime, and where the crime was committed.

Tribal governments have criminal jurisdiction over crimes 
committed by Indians in Indian country.  Tribal authority to sentence
offenders is limited to 1 year or less imprisonment and a $5,000 fine 
(25 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1302(7)).  Tribes generally share jurisdiction over
felony offenses with State or e serious felony offenses are under the
jurisdiction of State or Federal government authorities 
(see Methodology).  

69 facilities were operating in Indian 
country, with the capacity to hold 
2,118 persons on June 30, 1999

The 69 facilities identified in Indian country are affiliated
with 53 different tribal reservations and located in 18 States 
(table 1). Arizona contains the largest number of facilities (19), 
followed by Montana (9), New Mexico (9), and South Dakota (9).  

Unlike local jails that are operated by city or county governments, 
most jails in Indian country are owned and operated by tribal 
authorities or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Tribal governments 
manage the majority (48) of the facilities, BIA operates 20, and a 
private firm operates 1 facility. About half the facilities are owned 
by tribal authorities, and half by the BIA.

Combined, the 69 facilities had the rated capacity to confine
2,118 persons on June 30, 1999.  Rated capacity is the maximum
number of beds or inmates allocated by rating officials to each
jail facility.

On June 30, 1999, jails in Indian 
country supervised 1,693 persons

Jails in Indian country held 1,621 inmates in custody, and
supervised an additional 72 persons in the community on June 30,
1999.  The number of persons under supervision was up by 8% from 
the previous year, June 30, 1998, when 1,479 inmates were in custody 
and 88 persons were under community supervision.

Local jails operated by city or county governments held over
three times as many American Indians as jails in Indian country.
 At midyear 1999, local jails held an estimated 5,200 American
Indians or Alaska Natives.  Overall, State, Federal, local, and
tribal authorities were supervising 45,913 American Indians. 
The majority were under community supervision (26,234). 

A total of 19,679 American Indians were in custody at midyear
1999, most of whom were held in State prisons (11,123).

b/Year-end 1998 data.

American Indians account for just under 1% of the U.S. 
resident population, and around 1% of those in custody of 
jails or prisons.  At midyear 1999, the rate of incarceration 
for American Indians was about 15% higher than the national rate.  
Federal and State prison and jail authorities held 797 American 
Indians per 100,000 Indians in the U.S resident population, 
compared to 682 persons per 100,000 U.S.residents. 

On July 1, 1999, the total U.S. resident population of American
Indians and Alaska Natives reached an estimated 2,369,000 (U.S.
Census Bureau).  For additional information on American Indians
under correctional supervision outside Indian country see
American Indians and Crime, BJS report, NCJ 173386.  

16% of those in custody of jails in 
Indian country were juveniles

On June 30, 1999, jails in Indian country held 1,354 adults, 84%
male and 16% female.  Juveniles (persons under the age of 18) 
accounted for 16% of the total custody population.  About
three-quarters of the juveniles were male, and a quarter female.  
On June 30, 1999, 20 juveniles were being held as adults, down 
from 26 on June 30, 1998. 

Nearly 75% of those held in jails in Indian country at midyear
1999 were convicted, up from 63% the previous year.  Jails in
Indian country held 1,200 convicted offenders on June 30, 1999,
and 409 inmates that were unconvicted, or awaiting adjudication.
At midyear 1998,  939 persons were convicted, and 540
unconvicted.

Both admissions and releases were down by nearly 10% during the
month of June 1999, compared to June 1998.  In a 1-month period,
June 1999, facilities in Indian country admitted 8,147 persons,
a 9% decrease from June 1998, when 8,942 persons were admitted. 
The number of inmates released was also down, from 8,372 during
June 1998 to 7,744 for June 1999.   

On June 30, 1999, 72 persons were 
under community supervision, down 
from 88 the previous year

The number of persons under community supervision decreased by
18% on June 30, 1999, compared to June 30, 1998.  Among those 
under community supervision at midyear 1999, nearly half 
(31 persons) were required to perform community service, 14
were under electronic monitoring, 10 were on home detention, 5
were sentenced to day reporting, and 11 were under some other
form of supervision in the community.  During the previous year
over half of all persons in the community were supervised with
day reporting, compared to about 7% in 1999.

Most inmates in custody were 
confined in multiple occupancy
cells or rooms on June 30, 1998

At midyear 1998, nearly two-thirds of inmates held in custody
were housed in multiple occupancy cells or rooms.  Fourteen
percent of the custody population were housed in a single cell
or room.  

About 5% of inmates were housed in areas not originally intended
for confinement, and 11% were double-bunked in single cells. 
Another 7% of inmates were in separate holding areas or drunk
tanks.  In addition to the 1,479 inmates housed in Indian
country, 40 persons under Indian country jurisdiction were
housed by other authorities due to crowding. 

43 of the 69 jail facilities held 
misdemeanants in 1998

Just under two-thirds of jail facilities in Indian country held
inmates convicted of misdemeanors, or less serious crimes that
generally carry a sentence of 1 year or less.  Ten facilities held 
offenders convicted of felony offenses.  Nine of the facilities 
did not hold inmates beyond 72 hours.  Most facilities (43 of the 69) 
reported they are authorized to hold juveniles.  Among facilities 
that hold both adults and juveniles, two-thirds reported that juveniles 
are separated from adults by both sight and sound.  Nine facilities 
separated young persons by sight only, and four facilities reported that
juveniles were not separated from adults.

The 10 largest jails housed 40% of 
inmates in Indian country in 1999

On June 30, 1999, the 10 largest jails in Indian country housed
655 inmates, or about 40% of the total custody population.  Combined, 
the 10 facilities had a rated capacity of 681 inmates, or just over 
30% of the total rated capacity of all facilities in Indian country.   

The Tohono O'odham Detention Center reported the largest number
of inmates.  At midyear 1999, the facility was operating at 113%
capacity with 98 persons in custody.  The second largest
facility, the Sacaton Adult Detention Center, held 86 inmates in
custody on June 30, 1999, and was operating just under capacity
at 96%.  The 10 largest jails in Indian country were all located
in Arizona.  

Over half of all facilities in Indian country held 24 or fewer
inmates at midyear 1999.  Nineteen facilities reported fewer
than 10 inmates were in custody on June 30, 1999, 4 of which
reported a custody population of zero.  Larger facilities, those
holding 50 or more inmates, accounted for about 12% of all jails
in Indian country.

Indian country jails were operating 
at 108% capacity on peak day in 
June 1999, down from 115% in 1998

On their peak day in June 1999, jails in Indian country were
holding 2,289 persons, down from 2,306 on their peak day in June
1998.  At midyear 1998 about 15% of persons were  housed in
space not designed for housing inmates or for multiple occupancy.

On June 30, 1999, jails in Indian country were operating at 77%
capacity, up slightly from 74% the previous year.  At midyear
1998 just over half (58%) of the total juvenile capacity was
occupied.

15 jails in Indian country were 
operating above 150% capacity 
on peak day in June 1999

Nearly a quarter of jails in Indian country were operating above
150% capacity on their most crowded day in June 1999. Over half  
were operating above 100% capacity.  These numbers remained relatively
unchanged from June 1998, when 34 facilities were operating above 100%
capacity, and 14 facilities above 150% capacity.

The 15 facilities operating above 150% capacity on their peak

at the Mescalaro Adult Detention Center in New Mexico.  Since
the time of original construction, 28 facilities have been
renovated.  All but one facility completed the renovations in
the 1980's or 1990's.

Methodology

"Indian country" is a statutory term that includes:  all lands
within an Indian reservation; dependent Indian communities; and
Indian trust allotments (18 U.S.C. Sec.1151).  Tribal authority to
imprison Indian offenders is limited to one-year per offense by
statute (25 U.S.C. Sec.1302).  Thus, tribal courts generally
adjudicate misdemeanor crimes.

Tribal law enforcement agencies act as first responders to both
felony and misdemeanor crimes.  For most of Indian country, the
federal government provides felony law enforcement concerning
crimes by or against Indians.  Certain areas of Indian country
are under Public Law 280, which delegates Federal law
enforcement authority over crimes by and against Indians to the
States. 

Survey of Jails in Indian Country

The Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) was conducted by
the Bureau of Justice Statistics to describe all adult and
juvenile jail facilities and detention centers in Indian
country.  For purposes of this report, Indian country includes
reservations, pueblos, rancherias, and other Native American
communities throughout the United States.  The reference date
for this first comprehensive BJS survey of Indian facilities was
June 30, 1998.  The SJIC was initiated in 1998 as a component of
the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ), the 14th such survey in a
series begun in 1982.

The ASJ is conducted in each of the 4 to 5 years between the
Census of Jails.  The 1998 ASJ consisted of a sample survey of
795 jails operated by local governments, a survey of the
Nation's 25 multi-jurisdictional facilities, and a survey of the
69 facilities in Indian country.

The Office of Law Enforcement Services, Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA), U.S. Department of the Interior, provided a complete list
of 74 Indian country jail facilities.  At the time of the 1998
survey, 2 facilities no longer existed, 2 were closed, and 1 had
not begun operation, resulting in 69 surveyed facilities.  The
same 69 facilities were surveyed in 1999.  The facilities are in
18 States and are affiliated with 53 Indian tribes. 

Each facility is defined as a confinement facility, which can
include detention centers, jails, and other correctional
facilities, operated by tribal authorities or the BIA.  Special
jail facilities such as medical, treatment, or release centers;
halfway houses; and work farms are also included.  

For purposes of the survey, inmates are defined as all persons
under the supervision of a jail facility to include the
following:

all confined adults and juveniles 
(that is, persons under age 18);

*  persons in special programs administered by the jail (that
is, electronic monitoring, house arrest, community service, day
reporting, boot camps, work release, weekend, and other
alternatives to incarceration);

*  persons on transfer to treatment facilities but who remain
under the legal jurisdiction of the jail authorities;

*  and persons held for other jurisdictions.  Excluded are
inmates on AWOL, escape, or long-term transfer to other
jurisdictions.

Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires.  Through follow-up
phone calls, the survey achieved a response rate of 100%.
