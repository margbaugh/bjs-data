Highlights

On average each year between 1992 
and 1998, 2.6 million of the 10.2 million 
victims of violent crime in the United States 
were injured in the victimization

10.2 million nonfatal violent victimizations
                  *
         No injury   (74.7%)
         Injury      (25.3%)

            Minor/1     (20.8%)
            Severe/2    ( 3.4%)
            Rape/3      ( 1.1%)
 
1/Minor injuries include bruises, black eyes,
cuts, scratches, swelling, chipped teeth, and
undetermined injuries requiring less than 2
days of hospitalization.
 
2/Severe injuries include gunshot or knife
wounds, broken bones, loss of teeth, internal
injuries, loss of consciousness, and undeter-
mined injuries requiring 2 or more days of
hospitalization.
 
3/Rape/sexual assault with unspeci-
fied types of injuries.

*  Nearly 1 in 5 injured violent crime victims, 
or an average of just under 480,000 persons per
year, were treated in an emergency department 
or hospital for violence-related injuries. 

*  From 1992 through 1998, for every
homicide victim age 12 or older,
approximately 121 people were injured in 
a violent crime, including 16 people with 
severe injuries. 

*  The young, those with lower household
incomes, blacks, American Indians, and
Hispanics were more likely to be victimized
and were more likely to be injured than their
counterparts.

*  Of violent crimes measured by the NCVS, 
a higher percentage involved injury when
committed by an intimate partner (48%) or 
a family member (32%) than when committed
by a stranger (20%).

*  The percentage of victims of violence
receiving severe nonfatal injuries was lowest
in crimes committed without a weapon (2%),
higher in crimes committed with a firearm
(5%), and highest in crimes committed with 
a weapon other than a firearm (9%).

*  Between 1992 and 1998, 72% of the
average annual 21,232 homicide victims age
12 or older were killed with a firearm.

*  From 1992 to 1998, 25% of victimizations
resulting in severe injury and 46% of
victimizations resulting in minor injury were
not reported to law enforcement agencies.

Estimates from the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS) indicate that
each year between 1992 and 1998 an average 
of 10.2 million U.S. residents age 12 or 
older were victims of violence, including 
simple assault, aggravated assault, robbery, 
rape, and sexual assault.  

Overall, 25% of these violent crime victims --
about 2.6 million people -- were injured each
year.  Approximately 1 in 8 of these victims,
344,000 people annually, were severely
injured.  In addition, on average each year
more than 21,000 people were murdered,
1992-98.
 
Rates of injury from violence were higher
among the young, the poor, urban dwellers,
blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians. 
Injury rates were lower among the elderly,
persons with higher incomes, persons with
higher educational attainment, and the
married or widowed.  Persons victimized by
an intimate partner were more likely than
those victimized by acquaintances or
strangers to be injured.

From 1992 through 1998, there were 148,625
homicides in the United States among
persons age 12 or older, an average of
21,232 homicides per year.

Homicide is consistently among the top 5
causes of death for persons younger than 35. 
Homicide victims represent the smallest
proportion of violent crime victims.  For 
every 1,000 violent crimes, 2 are homicides.

After cresting in 1993 rates of homicide,
severe injury, and overall violent victimization
have declined.  Homicide and severe injury
rates dropped 35% while violent victimization
rates declined 30%, 1993-98.

Data on non-lethal violence are from the
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS),
a continuing survey of the public.  The number
of homicides are from the National Center for
Health Statistics, compiled by the Office of
Statistics and Programming, National Center
for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.  The number
of people in the population for these years
was determined by data from the Census
Bureau.

National Crime Victimization Survey

The NCVS is the Nation's primary source of
information on criminal victimization.  Data 
are continuously obtained from a nationally
representative sample of around 43,000
households comprising nearly 78,000 persons
age 12 or older.  Household members are
asked about the frequency, characteristics,
and consequences of criminal victimization.

The survey enables the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) to estimate the rate of
victimization by rape, sexual assault, robbery,
assault, theft, household burglary, and 
motor vehicle theft.  The rates describe the
susceptibility to crime by the population 
as a whole as well as by segments of the
population such as women, the elderly,
members of racial groups, and city dwellers.

In asking respondents about injuries resulting
from crime, the NCVS does not examine
emotional and mental trauma.

Types of injuries and crime

Between 1992 and 1998, 3 out of 4 violent
crime victims reported that they were not
injured during the crime.  During this 7-
year period about 1 in 4 victims of violence
reported sustaining some type of injury,
mostly minor.  While the proportion varied 
by type of crime, approximately 3% of all 
violent crime victims suffered a severe injury, 
and an additional 1% were victims of rape or 
sexual assault with unspecified type of injuries.

Of those injured, 82% reported such injuries
as bruises, black eyes, cuts, scratches,
swelling, chipped teeth, or other injuries
requiring less than 2 days hospitalization
denoted in this report as minor injuries.

to rounding.

Approximately 13% of injured crime victims
described severe injuries.  These injuries
included gunshot wounds, knife wounds,
broken bones, loss of teeth, internal injuries,
loss of consciousness, or other injuries
requiring 2 or more days of hospitalization. 
Another 4% experienced rape/sexual assault
with unspecified types of injuries.

Each year from 1992 to 1998 among U.S.
residents age 12 or older, about -- 

*  1 in 21 experienced a violent crime
*  1 in 84 suffered an injury as a result of a
violent crime  
*  1 in 627 sustained a severe injury 
*  1 in 10,169 died as a result of a violent
crime.

a/NCVS defines completed rape as injury.
Sixty-one percent of rape victims did
not report additional physical injuries.
b/Victims of completed rape with other injuries
were grouped according to the severity of these
additional injuries.

Rape is sexual intercourse forced on the
victim through physical or psychological
coercion.  Forced sexual intercourse means
vaginal, anal, or oral penetration by the
offender(s), including penetration by a 
foreign object. Victims can be male or female, 
and the rape can be heterosexual or homosexual. 

NCVS defines completed rape as an injury. 
Sixty-one percent of  victims of completed
rape did not report additional injuries.  For
purposes of this report, victims of  completed
rape without additional injuries were
categorized as injured but not as sustaining 
a severe or minor injury.  In addition, small
percentages of victims of attempted rape
(10%) and sexual assault (6%) who were injured 
but did not provide information on the nature 
of their injury beyond "attempted rape" or 
"sexual assault" were categorized as
injured with unspecified types of injuries.

Victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual
assault who reported other injuries were
grouped according to the severity of those
additional injuries (for completed rape, 6%
severe and 33% minor).
-------------------------------

Between 1992 and 1998 an estimated average 
annual 2.6 million nonfatal injuries resulted 
from violent crime, including 344,190 severe 
injuries.  The most common severe injuries 
classified were broken bones (33% of severe 
injuries and 4.4% of all injuries), knife
wounds (25% and 3.3%), and loss of 
consciousness (19% and 2.6%).  Most minor 
injuries were bruises, cuts, and scratches 
(80% of minor injuries and 66% of all 
injuries).

Injuries, treatment, and reporting 
to the police

One indicator of injury severity is the 
medical treatment victims received.  The 
majority of injured victims either were not 
treated or received treatment somewhere 
other than a hospital or emergency department 
(ED).

Injured victims of rape/sexual assault --
including those with additional, unspecified
injuries -- and  victims with injuries from a
simple assault (29% and 34%, respectively)
were less likely than injured victims of other
types of crime to receive medical attention. 
The majority of injured victims from
aggravated assaults (63%) and approximately
half of robbery victims (53%) required some
form of medical treatment.  By definition,
aggravated assault subsumes either the
presence of a weapon or severe injuries.

The likelihood of receiving medical care also
varied by type or severity of injury.  A 
majority of those with minor injuries reported 
receiving no medical treatment (62%) or care 
only at the scene (19%).  Victims with severe 
injuries were most often treated in a hospital 
or ED (62% overall).

Compared to victims who sustained other
types of injury, victims of rape/ sexual 
assault with unspecified types of injuries 
were the least likely to receive medical care 
(15%).

On average each year, just under 480,000
(19%) of the almost 2.6 million victims who
were injured required treatment in an ED or
hospital.  This included the almost 56,000
victims admitted to the hospital for at 
least 1 night.  Sixty-four percent of those 
admitted to a hospital for nonfatal injuries 
from violence stayed 3 days or more.  
Approximately 1 in 5 injured victims admitted 
to the hospital stayed 8 days or longer.

Among victims of incidents that resulted in
severe injuries, 37% were not treated in an
ED or hospital, 25% were not reported to the
police, and 18% were neither treated nor
reported. 

---------------------------
Counting crime-related injuries

Other methods for estimating the prevalence
and trends for nonfatal injuries from violence
in the United States rely on reports from
emergency departments (ED) or law
enforcement.  However, many injured victims
of violence may not seek medical assistance
from ED's or legal help from the police. 

Because the NCVS calculates incidence rates
based on data gathered directly from victims,
it can estimate the number of violent incidents
resulting in injury regardless of official
reporting.
---------------------------

Among the incidents that resulted in minor
injuries, 88% were not treated in an ED or
hospital, 46% were not reported to police, 
and 44% were neither treated nor reported. 
Among victims who suffered a rape/sexual
assault with unspecified types of  injuries,
91% were not treated in an ED or hospital,
69% did not report the crime to the police, 
and 68% neither sought treatment nor reported 
the incident to the police.

Level of homicide and trends in injury
from violent crime

Each year from 1992 through 1998, an
average of 21,232 persons age 12 or older
were homicide victims.  For every homicide
that occurred, approximately 121 people were
injured by violence, including 22 people
treated in an ED or hospital and 16 people
with severe injuries.

From 1993 to 1998 homicide rates dropped
every year.  Nonfatal violence showed a
similar trend, with rates for nonfatal violent
victimization and for victimizations with severe
injury cresting in 1993.  Rates for
victimizations with minor injury and for all
victimizations with injury declined since 1994.

The violent victimization rate declined 26%
from 52.2 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older
in 1992 to 38.4 in 1998, an average annual
percentage change of -3.6%.  The injury rate
declined 32% during this time, from 13.8 per
1,000 persons age 12 or older in 1992 to 9.4
in 1998, an average annual percentage
change of -4.7%.

The proportion of violent victimizations
resulting in injuries did not change
substantially, ranging between 24% and 26%
during this 7-year period.  The proportion of
violent victimizations resulting in severe
injuries also remained relatively stable,
around 3.4%. 

Characteristics of injured victims

Average annual victimization and injury rates,
1992-98, varied considerably by characteristics 
of the victim.  

The young had higher rates of injury from crime 
than older persons.  Urbanites had higher rates 
than persons living in a suburb or rural area. 
Black, Hispanic, or American Indian persons had 
higher injury rates than non-Hispanic whites or 
Asian/Pacific Islanders.  Comparing households at 
all annual income levels, members of households 
with the lowest income had the highest rates of 
violent victimization, injury from violent crime, 
and severe injury.

While the rate of violent victimization was
higher for males than females (55.8 versus
39.3 per 1,000 persons, respectively), injury
rates for males and females were not
significantly different (12.3 versus 11.6,
respectively) because male victims of crime
were less likely to be injured than female
victims (22% versus 29%, respectively).   

Violent victimization rates differed significantly
across race/ethnicity categories.  The rates
for violent victimization, victimization with
injury, and severe injury were lowest among
Asian/Pacific Islanders, higher among whites
and Hispanics, higher still among blacks, and
highest for American Indians. 

Persons between the ages of 12 and 24 were
about 9 times more likely than individuals age
50 or older to be a victim of a violent crime,
approximately 14 times more likely to be
injured as a result of a violent crime, and
about 9 times more likely to be severely
injured. 

Persons with the lowest household incomes
had the highest violent victimization rates, 
and a higher proportion of these victimizations
resulted in physical injuries (34% versus 20%,
respectively). 

Compared to persons with annual household
incomes of $50,000 or more, persons with
incomes of less than $20,000 were about 1.5
times more likely to become a victim of a
violent crime, about 2.5 times more likely 
to be injured during the course of the violent
victimization, and about 3.5 times more likely
to sustain a severe injury. 

                        Average annual rate per
                        1,000 persons age 12 or
                        older, 1992-98

$50,000 or more              39.6          7.8      0.8

Persons who did not go beyond junior high
school had significantly higher victimization
and injury rates than people with other levels
of education.

Persons who had never married and those
who were separated or divorced had higher
violent victimization, injury, and severe 
injury rates than those who were married or
widowed. 

Persons living in urban areas had higher
victimization, injury, and severe injury 
rates than their suburban or rural counterparts. 

Characteristics of violent offenders 

When each characteristic was considered
separately, a majority of injured violent 
crime victims described the offender(s) as 
being male, white, and strangers or acquaintances. 
An intimate victim-offender relationship and
the offender's consumption of alcohol and/or
drugs increased the likelihood of an injury to
the victim.

Among the injured, about 8 in 10 victims
reported that the offender was male, and
about 1 in 3 reported that the offender was
younger than 21.  Sixty percent of injured
victims reported that the offender was white. 
About 40% of all injured victims and severely
injured victims described the offender as
being on drugs and/or alcohol at the time of
the incident.  Approximately 1 in 5 injured
victims reported that the offender was an
intimate partner, and about 1 in 3 injured
victims reported the offender had committed a
crime against them previously.

----------------------------------
Intimate partner violence and injury, 1992-98

While a majority of males who were
injured from violence reported that the
offender was a stranger (56%), a far smaller
percentage of injured females were victimized
by a stranger (24%).  Females who were
injured in a violent crime were more likely to
have been victimized by an intimate (37%)
than a stranger.***Footnote:  Intimate includes 
spouse, ex-spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend, ex-
boyfriend, and ex-girlfriend.***  The opposite 
is true for injured males (4% of the injuries 
were perpetrated by an intimate).

Among the victims of intimate partner
violence, about half of the females versus one
third of the males were injured. Female
victims of intimate partner violence were more
likely to receive a severe (5%) or minor (42%)
injury than females who were victimized by a
known non-intimate (2% severe and 22%
minor) or a stranger (2% severe and 17%
minor).  Males victimized by an intimate were
more likely to have minor injuries (28%) than
males victimized by a known non-intimate
(21%) or a stranger (16%). The percentage of
males with severe injuries did not differ by
relationship to the offender.

*Includes rape/sexual assault with unspecified types  of injuries.
-----------------------------------

Those victimized by a female offender were
just as likely to be injured as were those
victimized by a male offender (both 25%). 
However victims of violence by male
offenders were significantly more likely than
victims of female offenders to be severely
injured (3% versus 2%, respectively).  Overall,
the percent of victims injured as a result of
violent crime did not vary substantially by the
age or race of the offender. 

When the offender was thought to have been
drinking alcohol or using drugs, the victim was
more likely to report being injured and about
2.5 times as likely to report being severely
injured as victims of offenders not perceived
to be under the influence.
Persons who were victimized by a spouse or
current or former boyfriend/girlfriend were
more likely to be injured than those victimized
by an ex-spouse or other family member;
those victimized by a friend or acquaintance
or stranger were the least likely to be injured. 
Overall, victims reporting the offender to have
been a spouse were 2.5 times more likely to
be injured than those reporting the offender to
have been a stranger (50% versus 20%,
respectively).

Victims who reported that the offender had
committed a crime against them previously
were somewhat more likely to be injured than
those reporting that the offender had
committed a crime against them for the first
time (30% versus 23%, respectively). 

Over three-fourths of victims of violence
reported that there was one offender.  Victims
were slightly more at risk of a severe injury if
there were two or more offenders.

Characteristics of the incident

Most victimizations involving injury occurred
at night (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) rather than during
the day, and a higher percentage of injuries
took place while the victim was inside or near
their home compared to other locations
examined.  

Victimizations that took place at night and
those that happened while the victims were at
home or at the home of a friend, relative, or
neighbor were more likely to result in injury
than those that took place during the day or in
other locations. 

While about half of violent crimes occurred
during the day, nearly two-thirds of violence
resulting in severe injury occurred at night.

Firearms-related fatal and nonfatal injuries
 
While NCVS data show that firearms were
involved in about 14% of the violent
victimizations that resulted in severe nonfatal
injuries, Vital Statistics data show that most
homicide victims died from injuries caused by
firearms.  Data from the National Center for
Health Statistics, Vital Statistics System,
indicate that 72% of the 148,625 homicide
victims age 12 or older between 1992 and
1998 died from firearm-related injuries.

----------------------------------

The highest proportion of injured victims
reported that they were at or near their home
when they were injured (33%) compared to
other locations.  Approximately half of injured
victims reported that they were at their home
or within 1 mile of their home when they were
injured.

Most violence resulting in injury occurred
while the victim was engaged in activities at
home (28%) or in leisure activities while away
from home (29%).  Substantially fewer injuries
occurred while the victim was at work (9%) or
school (8%).
 
Most nonfatal violent crimes (66%) did not
involve a weapon.  However 58% of severely
injured victims reported the offender(s) having
a weapon, usually a knife or other sharp
object -- such as a scissors, ice pick, or ax --
or a blunt object such as a rock or club (44%
altogether) rather than a firearm (14%).

Victims who experienced violence between
midnight and 6 a.m. were more likely than
persons victimized at other hours to sustain
an injury (35%) or to suffer a severe injury
(6%).  Among those victimized during the day
(6 a.m. to 6 p.m.), 22% were injured, including
2% with severe injuries.  Victimizations
occurring between midnight and 6 a.m. were
about 2.5 times as likely as victimizations
occurring during the day to result in severe
injuries.

Victimizations that occurred at or near the
victim's home or at the home of a friend,
relative, or neighbor were more likely to result
in injury (32% and 34%, respectively) than
victimizations that occurred elsewhere,
including open areas or public transportation
(23%).

As the distance between the location of the
incident and the victim's home increased, the
risk for injury tended to decrease.  While 31%
of those victimized at home were physically
injured, 21% of those victimized more than 50
miles from home were physically injured.

Victims engaged in activities at home or
leisure activities away from home at the time
of the victimization were more likely to be
injured (33% and 31%, respectively) than
those victimized while working (12%),
shopping (22%), going to and away from
home (23%), or attending school (23%). 

Victims of violent crime were less likely 
to be injured when the offender had a firearm
(15%), compared to crimes by unarmed offenders 
(26%) or by offenders armed with weapons 
other than firearms (33%).  Victims were 
more likely to have severe injuries if a
firearm (5%) or other weapon (9%) were
present than if no weapon was present (2%).

Survey methodology           
              
This Special Report presents data on nonlethal
violence from the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS).  The number of homicides are
from the National Center for Health Statistics,
compiled by the Office of Statistics and
Programming, National Center for Injury
Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.  The number of people
in the population for these years was
determined by data from the Census Bureau.  

The NCVS collects data on nonfatal crimes
against persons age 12 or older, reported and
not reported to the police, from a nationally
representative sample of households in the
United States.  The NCVS provides information
about victims (age, gender, race, ethnicity,
marital status, income, and educational level),
offenders (gender, race, approximate age, and
victim-offender relationship), and characteristics
of victimizations (time and place of occurrence,
use of weapons, and nature of injury).

Standard error computations

Comparisons made in this Special Report were
tested to determine if  observed differences
were statistically significant.  Differences
described as higher, lower, or different passed
a hypothesis test at the .05 level of statistical
significance (95% confidence level).  That is,
the tested difference was greater than twice the
standard error of that difference.  For
comparisons which were statistically significant
at the 0.10 level (90% confidence level),
"somewhat," "marginally," or "slightly" is used to
note the nature of the difference.

------------------------------------
Overall patterns and analytical
considerations

Data from self-report surveys are subject to
nonsampling error.***Footnote 1: Criminal
Victimization in the United States, 1994.
Appendix II, Survey Methodology for a
Discussion of Nonsampling Error.  BJS.
May 1997, NCJ 162126.***  Among the sources of
nonsampling error is misreporting by
respondents, both deliberate and
unintentional.  This is particularly important for
estimates of sexual violence and victimization
by intimates.  NCVS data presented in this
report were collected using redesigned
questionnaires incorporating improvements
that address concerns about these sources of
nonsampling error.***Footnote 2: Violence
Against women: Estimates from the Redesigned
Survey.  BJS. November 1994, NCJ 149259.***

Some have suggested that the subgroups of
the population at greatest risk for victimization
and injury, such as youth, minorities, and
those with lower household incomes, may be
less willing to participate in NCVS interviews. 
Refusal to participate could result in an
underestimate of the victimization and injury
rates for these groups.***Footnote 3: Cook,
Phillip J. "The Case of the Missing Victims:
Gunshot Woundings in the National Crime Survey."
Journal of Quantitative Criminology, Vol. 1,
pp.91-102, 1985.***  However, overall
NCVS participation rates, 1992-98, ranged
from 93% to 96% of eligible households and
from 89% to 94% of eligible individuals.

The Census Bureau adjusts the weighting
procedures for the National Crime
Victimization Survey to account for
nonresponse.

The data presented are limited to patterns
between pairs of variables; however, many of
the factors examined are interrelated.  A
multivariate analysis is necessary to
determine whether the patterns observed are
independent.
------------------------------------

Caution is required when comparing
estimates not explicitly discussed in this
Special Report.  What may appear to be large
differences may not test as statistically
significant at the 95% or even the 90%
confidence level.  Significance testing
calculations were conducted at BJS using
statistical programs developed specifically for
the NCVS by the Census Bureau.  These
programs consider the complex NCVS
sample design when calculating generalized
variance estimates.

----------------------------------
Generating confidence intervals

Below are the formulas for testing differences
in percentages or rates of  a single response
variable with the same base.  This formula
calculates the standard error of the difference
between two percentages derived from a
single response variable with the same base:
(See the report for formula)

The following example illustrates the use of
these formulas.  The proportion of violent
victimizations resulting in severe injuries was
3.4% (p1), and the proportion resulting in
minor injuries was 20.8% (p2) out of an annual
average total of 10,201,080 violent crime
victimizations.  Substituting the appropriate
values into the formula gives:

The confidence interval around the difference
at one standard error is from -16.2%
(-17.4%+1.2%) to -18.6% (-17.4%-1.2%). 
The ratio of the difference (-0.174%) to its
standard error (0.012) is (-.174/0.012) or
-14.5.  Since 14.5 is greater than 2.0, the
difference between these two percentages is
statistically significant at a confidence level
exceeding 95%.

Glossary

Aggravated assault -- Attack or attempted attack
with a weapon, regardless of whether or not an
injury occurred, or attack without a weapon when
severe injury results.

Incident -- A specific criminal act involving
one or more victims and offenders.  For
example, if two people are robbed at the
same time and place, this is classified as two
robbery victimizations but only one robbery
incident.

Minor injury -- Includes bruises, black eye,
cuts, scratches, swelling, chipped teeth, and
undetermined injuries requiring less than 2
days of hospitalization.

Rape -- Forced sexual intercourse, including
psychological coercion or physical force. 
Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal,
anal, or oral penetration by the offender(s). 
This category also includes incidents where
the penetration is from a foreign object such as a
bottle.  Includes attempted rapes, male and
female victims, and both heterosexual and
homosexual rape.  Attempted rape includes verbal
threats of rape.  For the NCVS completed rape is
always considered to involve injury.  Attempted
rape may or may not involve injury.

Robbery -- Completed or attempted theft,
directly from a person, of property or cash by
force or threat of force, with or without a
weapon, and with or without injury.

Severe injury -- Includes gunshot or knife
wounds, broken bones, loss of teeth, internal
injuries, loss of consciousness, or
undetermined injuries requiring 2 or more
days of hospitalization.

Sexual assault  --  A wide range of
victimizations, separate from rape or
attempted rape.  These crimes include attacks
or attempted attacks generally involving
unwanted sexual contact between victim and
offender.  Sexual assaults may or may not
involve force and include such things as
grabbing or fondling.  Sexual assault includes
verbal threats and may or may 
not involve injury. 

Simple assault -- Attack without a weapon
resulting in no injury, minor injury (such as
bruises, black eyes, cuts, scratches, or
swelling) or in undetermined injury requiring
less than 2 days of hospitalization.  Includes
verbal threats and attempted assault without a
weapon.

Victimization -- A crime as it affects one
individual person.  The number of victimizations
is equal to the number of victims involved.  The
number of victimizations may be greater than
the number of incidents because more than one
person may be victimized during an incident.  

Victimization rate -- A measure of the
occurrence of victimizations among a
specified population group.  This rate is based
on the number of victimizations per 1,000
residents age 12 or older.  

Violence, crimes of -- Rape, sexual assault,
personal robbery, or assault as measured by
the NCVS.  This category includes both
attempted and completed crimes.  Homicide
data are from the National Center for Health
Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
