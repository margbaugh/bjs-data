* Original Brady States are the 32 States required to follow presale
review procedures set out in the Brady Act when it became effective
on February 28, 1994.  At the end of 1997, 23 or the 32 were still 
Brady State.  (See table 2.)


* During 1997 about 69,000 out of an estimated 2,574,000
applications for the purchase of a handgun were rejected due to
presale background checks of the potential purchasers.  

* About 62% of the rejections were for a prior felony conviction
or a current felony indictment.  Domestic violence misdemeanor
convictions accounted for over 9% of rejections; domestic
violence protection orders, 2%.

* In the 46 months from the inception of the Brady Handgun
Violence Prevention Act to yearend 1997, an estimated 10,356,000 
applications for handgun purchases resulted in 242,000 
rejections through background checks.

* At the beginning of the Brady Act, March 1, 1994, 32 States 
and Puerto Rico were required to follow the procedures set forth
in the act (Brady States).  Currently there are 23 Brady States.

After November 1998 --

--Presale background checks will be required for sales of all
firearms, not just handguns. 

--Background checks will be made to the FBI's National Instant
Criminal Background Check System (NICS), either directly or
through the State Point of Contact (POC), unless the State
operates under an approved firearm permit system.

* During 1997 the FBI received 3,930,000 inquiries to its
National Crime Information Center about persons applying to
carry or purchase a firearm.
----------------------------------------------------------------

During 1997 about 2,574,000 background checks of potential
handgun buyers prevented an estimated 69,000 purchases.  The
inquiries revealed purchasers' ineligibility to buy a handgun
under State or Federal laws, particularly the Brady Handgun
Violence Prevention Act (Pub. L. No. 103-159, 107 Stat. 1536
(1993)) that became effective on February 28, 1994.  Sixty-two
percent of those rejected had been convicted of a felony or were
under felony indictment.

From March 1, 1994, through the end of 1997, handgun sellers
submitted an estimated 10.4 million inquiries about potential
handgun buyers of whom about 242,000 were rejected.  These
estimates include about 62,000 rejections of handgun purchase
applications in the last 10 months of 1994, 41,000 for all of
1995, and 70,000 for all of 1996.

The Firearm Inquiry Statistics (FIST) program administered by
the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collected the data.  
FIST was initiated in 1994 to describe presale background checks 
of applicants to buy a handgun from a Federal firearm licensee. 
Chief law enforcement officers made the checks in accordance
with the Brady Act or comparable State legislation.

The estimates of applications and rejections for handgun
purchases include States operating under the Brady Act (Brady
States) and States with comparable statutes preventing handgun
sales to prohibited persons (Brady-alternative States).  The
original 32 Brady States started following the Brady Act review
procedures on February 28, 1994.  There were 18 original
Brady-alternative States.  At the end of 1996, because of
changed statutes, there were fewer Brady States (23) and more
Brady-alternative States (27) than originally; there was no
change to this status in 1997.

Rates of rejection of potential handgun purchases in 1997 can be
compared for these sets of States -- the original or current
grouping of Brady and Brady-alternative States.

In 1997 the original Brady States processed 1,197,000
applications and rejected about 42,000, a rejection rate of
3.5%.  The original Brady-alternative States processed 1,378,000
applications and rejected 27,000 -- 1.9%, which differed
significantly from the rate for the original Brady States.  In
1996 the original Brady States processed an estimated 1,213,000
applications and rejected about 44,000, a 3.6% rejection rate
(Presale Handgun Checks, 1996, BJS Bulletin, NCJ 165704,
September 1997).  The original Brady-alternative States processed
1,380,000 applications and rejected 26,000 -- 1.9%.

The current Brady States in 1997 processed 803,000 applications,
of which they rejected 24,000, a rejection rate of 3.0%.  The
current Brady-alternative States processed 1,771,000 and
rejected 45,000 -- 2.5%, a rate lower than the rejection rate of
current Brady States.  For 1996, the current Brady States
processed 816,000 applications and rejected 25,000, a 3.1% rate,
and the current Brady-alternative States processed 1,778,000
applications and rejected 45,000 -- 2.5%.

For all States in both 1996 and 1997, the most prevalent reason
for rejection was that the applicant either was under felony
indictment or had a felony conviction (67.8% in 1996 and 61.7% 
in 1997) (table 1).

*Includes illegal aliens, juveniles, persons discharged from the armed
services dishonorably, person who have renounced their U.S. citizenship,
and other unspecified persons.  At the end of 1997, 23 of the 32 original
Brady States were still under the Brady Act.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

In 1997 a misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence (9.1%) 
or being a violator of a State law prohibition (6.1%) were the 
next most prevalent reasons for rejection of a handgun purchase, 
followed by being a fugitive from justice (5.9%).  In 1996 
rejection for being a fugitive was 6%, and State law prohibition 
was 5.5%. Misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence was not 
added as a prohibited category until October 1996.

Almost all States are able to check computer databases to
determine past criminal convictions (table 2).  Some States are
able to refer to other databases to check additional
characteristics that may make a person ineligible to purchase a
handgun -- fugitive status, court restraining orders, and mental
illness.

In the 44 States that reported rejections for fugitive status,
6.7% of handgun application rejections were for such a status. 
In the 36 States checking for a disqualifying domestic-violence
related restraining order, potential purchasers accounted for
5.5% of application rejections. Fifteen States reported
rejections for applicants with mental illness; in these States
mental illness accounted for 1.9% of the handgun application
rejections.  In States that reported rejections based on
misdemeanor convictions for domestic violence, 10.9% of handgun
application rejections were due to a prior misdemeanor
conviction.

Statewide reporting of handgun applications and rejections
----------------------------------------------------------------

State governments, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),
and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) have
cooperated to identify about 5,400 law enforcement agencies and
their heads as chief law enforcement officers (CLEOs)
nationwide.  Data for 1997 were collected from 268 CLEOs out of
a sample of 600.  311 CLEOs provided data in 1996.  The decline
is due in part to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in June 1996
that CLEOs were no longer required to make a mandatory
background check (see Background for further details).

Among the responding CLEOs, 21 served as the only CLEO for the
State and provided statewide totals (table 3).These States,
which represented 50% of U.S. resident population and 
over half of the total applicationsfor handgun purchases during
1997, processed 1,440,963 applications and rejected 35,382 -- 
a rejection rate of 2.5%.  Sixty percent of rejections were 
for a past felony conviction or felony indictment.

Background
----------------------------------------------------------------


Thirty-two States and Puerto Rico were required to follow the
review procedures set forth in the Brady Act when it became 
effective (identified in this Bulletin as original Brady States).
By the end of 1996 and through 1997, the number of States
following the Brady Act review procedures rather than
alternative State statutes had dropped to 23 (identified as
current Brady States; see table 2 for each State's Brady status.)

Pursuant to the Federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as codified at
18 U.S.C. sec. 922, the sale of firearms is prohibited if the prospective
purchaser -- 

* is a juvenile

* is a fugitive from justice

* is under indictment for, or has been convicted of, a crime
punishable by   imprisonment for more than 1 year

* is an unlawful user of a controlled   substance

* has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a
mental institution

* is an alien unlawfully in the United States

* was discharged from the armed forces under dishonorable
conditions

* has renounced U.S. citizenship

* is subject to a court order restraining him or her from
harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child
or 

* is a person convicted of domestic violence.

Note:   All estimated counts are rounded.  Percentages were
calculated  from unrounded data.  Detail may not add to total
because of rounding. 
a/Data for 1994 and 1995 from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms are based on inquiries to the FBI's National Crime 
Information Center. 
b/Original Brady States are the 32 States required to follow 
presale review  procedures set out in the Brady Act when it 
became effective on February 28, 1994.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) calculated
the number of applications for firearm purchases from March of
1994 to the end of 1995.  (See Presale Firearm Checks, BJS
Bulletin, NCJ-162787, February 1997.)  The BATF estimates were
calculated using the number of firearm-coded inquiries to the
FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC).  The percentage
of denials used for these estimates was based on the experiences
of jurisdictions that had implemented presale firearms check
procedures prior to the Brady Act. 

After the first 10 months of implementation of the Brady Act,
the number of NCIC firearm-coded inquiries per 100,000 adult U.S. 
residents remained relatively consistent:

1994*    2262
1995     2083
1996     1957
1997     1984

*January and February were imputed, 
using the average of those 
months, 1995-97.

On average during 1997 the FBI receives every month nearly
328,000 inquiries to the NCIC to qualify a person to purchase or
carry a firearm.  (See figure 1, page 5.)  

The FIST data, also stable across the 4-year period, describe
only applications for handgun purchases, a fraction of the
larger number of potential firearm purchases.  (The interim
provisions of the Brady Act also cover only applications for a
handgun purchase.)

Data collection for FIST began in January 1996. The estimated
number of inquiries for handgun purchases during the year was
67% of the total number of firearm inquiries to the NCIC
(3,842,000).  To estimate the number of inquiries for handgun
purchase applications before 1996, the BATF estimates were
multiplied by 67%.

The Brady Act was enacted in November 1993 and became effective
in February 1994.  The interim provisions of the Act require
that federally licensed firearm dealers request a presale check
on all potential handgun purchasers.  The requests are made to
CLEOs in the jurisdictions where the prospective purchasers
reside.

The Federal firearms licensee must wait 5 business days before
transferring the handgun to the buyer, unless earlier approval
is received from the CLEO.  These interim procedures will
terminate no later than November 30, 1998.

The "interim provision" also permits States to follow a variety
of alternative State procedures.  (See Survey of State
Procedures Related to Firearm Sales, 1996, BJS report,
NCJ-163918, September 1997.)  To qualify under these
alternatives, State law must require that before any licensee
completes the transfer of a handgun to a nonlicensee, a government 
official must verify that possession of a handgun by the transferee
would not be a violation of law.  Examples of Brady-alternative 
States include California ("point-of-sale check"), Virginia 
("instant check"), and Missouri (permit).

After November 1998 a Federal firearms licensee will be required
to obtain background checks on potential purchasers of all
firearms.  These inquiries will be made through the National
Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) that the FBI
will operate and maintain.  

Under the permanent NICS configuration, firearm dealers can make
NICS presale firearm inquiries either through the State, which
will serve as a Point of Contact (POC) to the FBI, or directly
to the FBI.  The Brady Act also enables States to meet the
requirements of the permanent system through an ATF- approved
permit system.  Felony and other criminal record data will be
accessed by means of the Interstate Identification Index.  In
addition, the FBI NICS Index will provide States with access to
Federal data on nonfelony prohibiting categories, such as
illegal aliens.  States serving as POCs will also have access 
to State data on nonfelony prohibiting categories.

On June 27, 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the
provision requiring  mandatory background checks by CLEOs in
Brady States (see Printz [95-1478] and Mack [95-1503] v. United
States).  Since then, CLEOs in the Brady States continuing to do
background checks do so on a voluntary basis.  In
Brady-alternative States (including States operating under a
permit system) checks are made in accordance with State law. 
The impact of this decision on making a national estimate of
presale handgun checks is addressed in Methodology.

----------------------------------------------------------------
The National Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP)
----------------------------------------------------------------

To ensure immediate availability of complete and accurate State
records, the Brady Act established a grant program authorized at
$200 million.  

An additional authorization of $20 million was made available
through the National Child Protection Act of 1993 (Pub. L. No.
103-209, 107 Stat. 2490 (1993)), and $6 million were authorized
under the Violence Against Women Act (42 USC 13701 et seq.). 
The NCHIP program under which these funds are awarded is
designed to assist States to develop or improve existing
criminal history records systems and to establish an interface
with the NICS.  

Under NCHIP over $162 million was given in direct awards to the
States during fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997.  The
appropriation for 1998 is $47.75 million.  NCHIP funds have
supported direct technical assistance to States, evaluation, and
research related to improving criminal and other nonfelony
records within the States.

The FIST program was established under NCHIP.  Information
requested from CLEOs does not include data traceable to an
applicant and none of the FIST information provided from
agencies to BJS contains or reveals the identity of individual
applicants.  The computer program that was subsequently
developed and used by some agencies for both operational
purposes and to collect FIST data transmits only the
appropriately aggregated or categorized responses.  Moreover,
the computer program assists agencies to purge records after the
delay times specified by law.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Methodology
----------------------------------------------------------------

The following presents the approach used to derive the 1997
estimates from a sample of chief law enforcement officers
charged with determining eligibility to purchase a handgun. The
data were stratified by size of the population served. 
Information collected included the following:

* handgun applications made to the  CLEO; 
* handgun applications rejected by the CLEO; and 
* the reasons for rejection.  

The sample for the survey was selected from a population of
5,400 CLEOs.  These CLEOs ranged from State agencies which
served an entire State population (category X); local CLEOs
which served a population greater than 100,000 (category C);
local CLEOs which served a population between 10,000 and 100,000
(category B); and local CLEOs which served a population of less
than 10,000 (category A).  Population size was based on 1990
Census information.

The population categories were chosen to be consistent with
those commonly used by the FBI when conducting similar studies. 
A total of 600 CLEOs were randomly selected for inclusion 
in the study.

Since the start of this study two States have implemented
operation of state- wide CLEOs, and one State has begun
reporting data for local jurisdictions.  These changes have
reduced the total number of CLEOs selected to 579.

The sample universe includes all 25 statewide CLEOs (category
X), all 118 CLEOs who service populations in excess of 100,000
persons (category C), 189 CLEOs from category B, and 247 from
category A.  For each State 4% or a minimum of five CLEOs were
selected in their respective A and B categories.

Overall, 268 CLEOs provided data for a response rate of 46%. 
Respondents included 23 statewide CLEOs, 41 local CLEOs in
category C, 95 local CLEOs in category B, and 109 local CLEOs in
category A.  The 268 agencies that submitted data serviced
158,815,381 people or 64% of the 248,102,973 people who were
identified in the 1990 Census.

Based on data provided by these CLEOs, national estimates were
developed using weighting factors derived from the original
stratification.  When a CLEO did not provide data for all months, 
a simple linear extrapolation or interpolation was used to 
generate a 12-month total.

Information for one State required further analysis.  New Jersey
provided data on the number of applications and the number of
rejections for the whole State, but did not provide reasons for
rejections.  Local CLEOs that had been sampled in New Jersey
provided data on the reasons for rejection.

For purposes of applications, rejections and rejection rates,
information from the statewide CLEO was used.  The descriptive
information about reasons for rejections used the data from both
the local and State CLEOs.

Maine is one of several States that use both local CLEOs and the
State police in areas not serviced by a local CLEO.  In the
other States, data from the State police were classified as
category A data because of the rural area that is normally being
served.  However, Maine, because of the large portion of the
State that the State police service (40%) and the wide range of
population classifications they serve, State police data were
classified as category X data.

Three agencies with a rejection rate over four standard
deviations above the average standard rejection rate were
classified as outliers and their data were not used for
projection of estimates.  In addition, one agency was classified
as an outlier because its final rejection rate could not be
determined with sufficient accuracy.  The data provided by the
outliers were added to the total estimated counts to get the
final national totals.

To compensate for the June 1997 Supreme Court decision, the
CLEOs from Brady States that had been selected for this study
were surveyed to determine if they stopped performing background
checks.  For each size category, a percentage of the population
which had stopped participating was computed.  These percentages
were then applied to the estimated number of rejections for that
size category and subtracted from the total estimated number of
rejections.

The accuracy of the estimates presented in this report depends
on two types of errors: nonsampling and sampling.  In this
study, nonsampling error may occur from the following: 
nonresponse; differences in the ways CLEOs process, code, store
and retrieve their information; differences in interpretation of
the survey questions; and even activities which delay personnel
from doing paperwork.

Also, the process of a researcher receiving data and storing it
in the computer for analysis can introducenonsampling error.  In
any sample survey, the full extent of nonsampling error is never
fully known.  However, steps were taken to minimize the
potential for error.  Extensive telephone follow-ups were made
to encourage responses, answer questions about misunderstood
requests, and generally help CLEOs in assembling the information
in a form useable by FIST.  Extensive verification of the data
ensured the accuracy of the numbers.

Because of the sampling design, State comparisons cannot be
made.  The estimates are only for the 50 States and do not
include U.S. territories or the District of Columbia.  Sales of
all firearms are prohibited in the District of Columbia except
to law enforcement officers.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Data collection procedures
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Regional Justice Information Service (REJIS), through a
cooperative agreement with BJS under the Firearm Inquiry
Statistics program (FIST), collected the data.  

The CLEOs supplied data on either paper or diskette.  Several
different forms were provided to meet the varying office
procedures of the CLEOs.  In addition REJIS wrote and provided
special software that was distributed free of charge to
requesting CLEOs.  This software was designed to simplify the
record tabulating functions of the CLEO.  It also helped to
reduce the burden of keeping the statistical data since one of
the capabilities of the software was to automatically collect
the data needed for the study.  In all cases the data that the
CLEO sent to REJIS contained only statistical information and
would not allow the identification of an individual.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Determining populations
----------------------------------------------------------------

For local CLEOs, a State may choose to have county officials
(usually the sheriff) as the CLEO or municipal officials (police
departments) or a combination of the two.  To evaluate properly
the application and rejection rates for purchasing handguns
within a given area, the appropriate CLEO population was needed
and was determined as follows:

* The stratification classification of the county was based on the
size of the largest city within the county.

* If cities within a participating county CLEO were acting as
their own CLEOs, their populations were subtracted from the
county population.

* If a municipal CLEO was discovered to be providing services for
other selected municipalities, then populations for those
municipalities were added to the populations of the city having
the CLEO.

* Those CLEOs selected to participate in the study but found to be
relying on other jurisdictions to conduct background checks were
replaced by those other jurisdictions (for example, a town being
replaced by a county).
