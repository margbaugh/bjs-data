Highlights
__________

* Weapons arrestees are predominantly male, age 18
or over, and white.  However, weapons arrest rates
per 100,000 population are highest for teens and
for blacks.

* Arrests of juveniles comprise an increasing
proportion of weapons arrests. 

* The number of Federal weapons offenses
investigated and prosecuted has increased at least
4-fold since 1980. 

* Average prison sentence lengths for Federal
weapons offenders have increased, while those for
State offenders have decreased.

* Of the defendants in felony weapons cases in the
75 largest counties in 1992, two-fifths were on
probation, parole, or pretrial release at the time
of the offense, and a third had previously been
convicted of a felony.  

* Weapons offenders are making up an increasing
proportion of admissions to State and Federal
prisons. 

* Although many more offenders are admitted to
Federal prison for drug offenses than for weapons
offenses,  from 1985 to 1992 the rate of increase
in admissions of weapons offenders was 4 times
greater than the rate of increase of drug
offenders. 

* Weapons charges as an addition to other charges
are more common at the Federal level than the State
level.

This report is the second in a series on firearms,
crime, and criminal justice.  The first report in
the series, Guns Used in Crime (NCJ-148201, July
1995), includes definitions of commonly used
firearm terms.

What are weapons offenses?

Weapons offenses are violations of statutes or
regulations that control deadly weapons.  Deadly
weapons include firearms and their ammunition,
silencers, explosives, and certain knives.  About
2% of arrests nationwide in 1993 were for weapons
offenses.

All States, some localities, and the Federal
Government have criminal laws concerning deadly
weapons, including restrictions on their--
* possession
* carrying
* use
* sales or trafficking
* manufacturing
* importing and exporting. 

Many of these laws are specific to firearms.  For
example, in 1994 all States and the District of
Columbia had statutes concerning the carrying of
firearms; some required permits to carry a
concealed weapon, and some prohibited open carrying
of firearms. 

Federal law regulates the importation, 
manufacture, and distribution of firearms; bans
certain firearms such as machine guns and
semiautomatic assault weapons; and prohibits the
sale of some firearms to restricted classes of
people, including convicted felons and juveniles.

How many arrests for weapons offenses are made
annually?

The FBI's Crime in the United States, 1993,
estimated that State and local law enforcement
agencies made 262,300 arrests in which a weapons
offense was the most serious charge.  


From 1974 to 1993, the number of arrests for
weapons offenses increased 54%, while the total
number of arrests for all crimes increased 55%. 
The proportion of all arrests that were for weapons
offenses remained fairly constant during the
period.  The number of violent offenses (murders,
robberies, and aggravated assaults) committed with
a firearm increased 78%.

Arrests of juveniles comprise an increasing
proportion of weapons offense arrests 

Juveniles accounted for 16% of those arrested for
weapons offenses in 1974 and 23% in 1993.  Between
1985 and 1993, the number of juvenile arrests for
weapons offenses increased by more than 100%, from
just under 30,000 to more than 61,000; at the same
time, adult arrests grew by 33%.

Juveniles are subject to additional weapons
restrictions in many jurisdictions 

Both the States and the Federal Government have
jurisdiction over the possession of firearms by
juveniles.

At the Federal level, the Youth Handgun Safety Act
of 1994 prohibits the possession of handguns by
anyone under age 18 and provides criminal sanctions
of up to 10 years in prison for anyone convicted of
providing a handgun to a person under age 18. 
There are a number of exceptions to the prohibition
including possession for employment, for hunting,
and for firearm safety training.  Prior to
enactment of this law, Federal firearms licensees
were prohibited from selling handguns to anyone
under age 21 and rifles and shotguns to anyone
under age 18.  However, the earlier Federal law did
not prohibit the sale of firearms to juveniles by
unlicensed persons and did not prohibit the
possession of any type of firearm by juveniles.
  
According to a 1994 study of State laws by the
National Criminal Justice Association, all 50
States and the District of Columbia have firearms
laws that specifically apply to juveniles.  In
addition--
* half the States prohibit or restrict a juvenile's
possession of firearms without some form of
parental or adult supervision or permission 
* 24 States explicitly prohibit or restrict a
juvenile's possession of a handgun.

The ages covered by firearms restrictions on
juveniles vary; in some States the laws apply to
persons under age 16, and in others, to persons
under age 21. 
 
More than two-thirds of the States have enacted
general prohibitions against the possession of a
firearm in or near a school or similar facility,
such as a daycare center.

________________________________________________
How many delinquency cases involving weapons
offenses are handled by the juvenile courts?  

Juveniles who commit criminal law violations are
handled by the juvenile justice system in
delinquency cases.  Adults who commit the same acts
are prosecuted in the criminal courts.  In 1992
juvenile courts processed an estimated 41,000
delinquency cases (about 3% of those processed) in
which the most serious offense involved weapons. 
Between 1988 and 1992, the number of delinquency
cases involving weapons grew 86%, more than any
other offense type. 

The National Center for Juvenile Justice reported
that of the weapons offense cases involving
juveniles that were disposed of in 15 States in
1992, 57% were handled formally (petitioned) by
juvenile courts.  Of those weapons cases
petitioned, 63% were formally adjudicated by the
court.  Of the adjudicated weapons cases, about 31%
resulted in an out-of-home placement, 56% resulted
in probation, 6% received other sanctions, and 6%
were dismissed.

__________________________________________________
Some juveniles may be prosecuted for weapons
offenses in criminal court

In some States, some juveniles charged with
selected offenses may be prosecuted in criminal
court.  Juveniles come under criminal court
jurisdiction in one of three ways:

* statutory exclusion where the State law
specifically excludes certain offenses from
juvenile court jurisdiction
* prosecutorial discretion where the prosecutor may
file certain juvenile cases in either juvenile or
criminal court
* judicial waiver where a juvenile court judge may
waive jurisdiction and transfer the case to
criminal court.

According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention's Juvenile Offenders and
Victims: A National Report, the provisions used
vary by State: 

* Cases involving juveniles accused of a weapons
offense are excluded by statute from the juvenile
court in four States; at age 15 in Illinois and at
age 16 in Indiana, Maryland, and Oklahoma.  

* Prosecutors may decide whether to prosecute
juveniles of a minimum age for any criminal offense
in three States and for weapons offenses in two
States (Colorado and Florida). 

* Judges have discretion to transfer any case that
involves a juvenile of a minimum age to adult court
for any criminal offense in 23 States and for any
felony charge in 25 States.  Such authority is
provided to judges specifically in weapons cases
involving juveniles in six States (Arkansas,
California, the District of Columbia, Montana, New
Jersey, and New Mexico).  

According to the BJS National Judicial Reporting
Program, an estimated 640 persons under age 18 were
convicted as adults of felony weapons offenses in
State criminal courts in 1992.    
_________________________________________________
Most defendants charged with weapons offenses are
released pending trial

In 1992, 71% of the defendants charged with felony
weapons offenses in the Nation's 75 largest
counties were released prior to trial.  The
remainder included 4% held without bail and 25%
held although bail had been set.  Of all weapons
defendants, 28% were granted a nonfinancial release
including 18% released on personal recognizance.

Federal courts in 1990 released 80% of the felony
weapons offense defendants prior to trial.  The
remainder included 16% held without bail and 5%
held although bail had been set.  Of all weapons
defendants, 60% were granted a nonfinancial release
including 15% released on personal recognizance.

__________________________________________________
The number of Federal weapons offenses investigated
and prosecuted has increased since 1980

* In 1992 U.S. attorneys investigated 7,971
suspects and prosecuted 5,613 suspects who had a
Federal weapons violation as their most serious
offense.  Between 1980 and 1992, the number
investigated increased 4-fold, and the number
prosecuted increased 5-fold.

* The proportion of all suspects investigated and
prosecuted by U.S. attorneys and whose most serious
charge was a weapons offense more than doubled from
1980 to 1992, growing from 3% to 7% of all
investigations and from 3% to 8% of all
prosecutions.

* Increases in the number of Federal investigations
and prosecutions for weapons offenses may have been
due to new Federal statutes enacted during the last
decade.  For example, the Omnibus Drug Initiative
Act of 1988 added several provisions prohibiting
the acquisition or transfer of firearms in
furtherance of drug trafficking crimes, and the
Crime Control Act of 1990 added several provisions,
including a prohibition on assembling from imported
parts any rifle or shotgun that may not legally be
imported into the United States.

__________________________________________________
How many felony weapons defendants had a criminal
justice status or prior criminal history at the
time of the offense?

According to Felony Defendants in Large Urban
Counties, 1992, 42% of the felony weapons
defendants had acriminal justice status at the time
of the offense including--
* 17% on probation 
* 10% on parole 
* 14% on pretrial release.  

Of the felony weapons defendants, 34% had at least
one prior felony conviction, and 17% had at least
one misdemeanor conviction.  Of those felony
weapons defendants with a history of felony
convictions, more than half had two or more such
convictions.  Convicted felons and, in some States,
some misdemeanants are prohibited from possessing
guns or other deadly weapons. 

__________________________________________________
How many cases with a weapons offense as the most
serious charge result in a conviction?

Few weapons arrests (an estimated 11%) result in a
felony conviction.  Some people arrested for
weapons offenses are charged with misdemeanors
rather than felonies.

Felony Defendants in Large Urban Counties, 1992,
reported that 68% of weapons defendants charged
with a felony were convicted:  55% for a felony and
13% for a misdemeanor.  Of those convicted of a
weapons offense, 93% pleaded guilty.

At the Federal level in 1992, about 84% of weapons
cases resulted in a conviction.  Of the 3,177
convicted of a Federal weapons offense, 85% pleaded
guilty.

In both 1990 and 1992, weapons offenses accounted
for about 3% of felony convictions in State courts
nationwide.  In 1992, for 6% of all those convicted
in Federal district court, their most serious
conviction offense was a weapons offense.  

__________________________________________________
Where do felony weapons offense convictions occur?

Most felony convictions occur in State courts.  Of
all felony convictions in 1990, State courts
accounted for 96% and Federal courts for 4%.  Most
felony weapons convictions also occurred in State
courts (90%).  While the Federal courts account for
about 4% of all felony convictions nationwide,
about 10% of felony convictions for weapons
violations occur in Federal court.

_____________________________________________
Who is convicted of felony weapons offenses?

Of those convicted of State felony weapons offenses
in 1992--
* 96% were male
* 60% were black
* half were age 27 or under.

_________________________________________________
What kinds of sentences are given to offenders
convicted of weapons offenses?

In 1992, two-thirds of the estimated 26,000
offenders convicted in State courts of felony
weapons offenses were sentenced to incarceration: 
40% to prison and 26% to jail.  About a third were
sentenced to probation.  The average sentence
length given to weapons offenders was
approximately--
* 4 years for those sentenced to prison
* 6 months for those sentenced to jail
* 3 years for those sentenced to probation.

Felony weapons offenders sentenced to prison were
almost twice as likely as those receiving jail or
probation terms to have had multiple conviction
offenses.

Of all offenders convicted of felony weapons
offenses, some had additional sanctions attached to
their sentences including--
* 14% who were fined
* 7% who had to pay restitution
* 5% who were sentenced to community service
* 4% who were sentenced to treatment.
The additional penalty may have resulted from a
secondary conviction offense in addition to the m
ore serious weapons conviction.

Among convicted weapons offenders sentenced in
Federal court in 1992, 86% were imprisoned, and 21%
received probation. Less than 1% received a
sentence of a fine only.

Many State and Federal laws concerning weapons
offensses provide for mandatory prison terms and
sentence length enhancements

According to the report National Assessment of
Structured Sentencing, prepared for the Bureau of
Justice Assistance, 41 States have mandatory
minimum sentences to prison for certain weapons
offenses such as using a firearm in the commission
of a felony.  Also, some State statutes permit
judges to enhance or lengthen an offender's
sentence for a crime committed with a deadly
weapon.  Marvell and Moody reported that such
statutes were in force in 20 States as of 1992. 

Federal law concerning the use of firearms provides
for both sentencing enhancements and mandatory
minimums and includes--

* the Armed Career Criminal Act enacted in 1984,
and amended in 1986, which provides enhanced
penalties for persons who are convicted of
possessing firearms and have three previous State
or Federal convictions for violent felonies or
serious drug offenses

* the 1986 amendments to the Firearms Owners
Protection Act which imposes mandatory penalties
for the use or carrying of firearms in the
commission of drug trafficking crimes.

Are admissions to prison for weapons offenses
growing as rapidly as those for drug offenses?

In recent years, drug offenders made up an
increasing proportion of admissions to prison and
accounted for a large share of the overall growth
in the prison population.  Weapons offenders make
up a much smaller proportion of prison admissions
than drug offenders, but their proportion of all
admissions has also grown.  

At the State level, admissions for drug offenses
grew faster than those for weapons offenses, but at
the Federal level the opposite was true:
* Among those entering State prisons, the number of
weapons offenders increased more than 140% between
1985 and 1992, compared to about a 300% increase in
the number of drug offenders. 
* Over the same years, the number of Federal
offenders imprisoned for drug offenses increased
just over 60%, while the number of Federal weapons
offenders imprisoned increased 4 times as fast,
growing about 240%. 

_________________________________________________
State prisons hold more weapons offenders than
Federal prisons, but weapons offenders are more
prevalent in Federal prisons

In 1991 two simultaneous surveys, the Survey of
Inmates in State Correctional Facilities and the
Survey of Inmates in Federal Correctional
Facilities, revealed that weapons offenders were
about 3 times as prevalent in the Federal prison
population--5.7% of Federal prisoners and 1.8% of
State prisoners were serving time after conviction
for a weapons offense.  However, State prisons held
about 4 times as many convicted weapons offenders
as Federal prisons; in 1991 an estimated 12,700
weapons offenders were in State prisons, and 3,100
were in Federal prisons.

__________________________________________________
Average time served in prison is similar for State
and Federal weapons offenders

Federal weapons offenders released in 1992 had
served an average of 4 months longer in confinement
than those released in 1985.  By contrast, released
State weapons offenders in 1992 served about 1
month longer than those released in 1985.

__________________________________________________
In 1991, 60% of weapons offenders  in State prison
were on probation or parole at the time of
admission 

According to the 1991 Survey of Inmates in State
Correctional Facilities, 46% of those in prison
were probation or parole violators, including 35%
who were convicted of a new offense and 10% who had
technically violated the conditions of their
release.  In State prisons, about 2% of all
probation violators and parole violators were
admitted for a weapons offense.   

Federal law and many State laws prohibit convicted
felons from possessing guns.  In some States, such
prohibitions also apply to some misdemeanants. 
Although 14% of all violators (35,000) reported
being armed when they committed their current
offense, 1 out of 5 of them (7,000) were actually
convicted of a weapons violation.

Probation and parole conditions of release often
prohibit offenders from possessing firearms or
deadly weapons.  Technical violations of the
conditions of release may result in revocation of
probation or parole.  Less than 1% of the violators
in prison were there because their probation or
parole was revoked for a technical violation
involving weapons.

___________________________________________________
Weapons offense charges may company more serious
charges

When a weapon is used or possessed during the
commission of a crime, the defendant may be charged
with a weapons offense in addition to the primary
criminal charge.  The Congress and many State
legislatures have passed laws that target armed
offenders with additional sanctions including
mandatory minimum terms in prison or enhancements
to the length of the prison sentence imposed.  

________________________________________________
Additional weapons charges in cases brought in
State courts are uncommon

In general, most offenders are not charged with or
convicted of more than one felony.  Offenses in
addition to more serious charges were present for--
* 34% of the defendants charged with a felony
* 21% of convicted offenders
* 35% of State prison inmates.y
Few defendants or offenders were charged or
convicted of additional weapons offenses.  Weapons
offenses in addition to more serious offenses were
present for--
* 2% of the felony defendants 
* 1% of convicted offenders
* 5% of State prison inmates.
__________________________________________________
Weapons offenses accompanied all types of offenses
including property crimes and drug offenses

Defendants and offenders whose most serious offense
was a weapons offense were more likely than those
charged or convicted of other offenses to have
additional weapons charges or convictions.

Defendants or offenders charged or convicted of the
violent crimes of murder, robbery, and aggravated
assault were the next most likely to have
additional weapons offenses.

__________________________________________________
At the Federal level, additional weapons
convictions are more common than at the State level

Federal Firearms-related Offenses,a BJS study of
U.S. Sentencing Commission data, found that the
2,400 Federal offenders convicted of an additional
firearms offense 
included--
* 21% of convicted violent offenders
* 8% of convicted drug offenders 
* 1% of public-order offenders 
* 0.4% of property offenders.

Of those convicted of an additional firearms
offense, 82% were convicted of the use or carrying
of a firearm in the commission of another offense
and 10% were convicted of illegally possessing the
weapon as a prohibited person (such as convicted
felons, mental defectives, or illegal aliens).

Ninety-nine percent of the Federal offenders
convicted of an additional weapons offense were
sentenced to prison.  Violent offenders convicted
of a firearms charge in addition to another offense
were sentenced to an average of more than 12 years. 
Over a third of the sentence length imposed for
these offenders was attributable to the firearms
conviction. 

__________________________________________________
Federal sentencing guidelines also consider the
involvement of deadly weapons, particularly
firearms

Sentences in Federal courts are determined through
the application of sentencing guidelines.  Two
factors--the seriousness of the offense and the
offender's criminal history--determine what
sentence a convicted Federal offender will receive. 
The presence or use of a firearm during the
commission of the offense is one measure of
seriousness.  Even when offenders are not convicted
of separate firearms offenses, they may receive
additional sanctions because the use of a firearm
during the crime increases the sentence recommended
under the guidelines or raises the penalty to that
for an "aggravated offense" class.

According to Federal Firearms-related Offenses,
during the fiscal year ending on September 30,
1993, 1,786 Federal offenders received enhanced
sentences under the guidelines because of firearms
involvement.  Over a quarter of the Federal
offenders convicted of a violent crime were given a
sentence enhancement because of firearms
involvement.  Their sentences increased by about
19% because of the firearms involvement.
