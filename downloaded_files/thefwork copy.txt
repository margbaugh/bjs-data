Violence and Theft in the Workplace
By Ronet Bachman, Ph.D.
BJS Statistician     


Each year nearly 1 million individuals become victims of violent
crime while working or on duty.  These victimizations account
for 15% of the over 6. million acts of violence experienced by
U.S. residents age 12 or older.  In addition, over 2 million
personal thefts and over 200,000 car thefts occur annually while
persons are at work.  This report analyzes data from the
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) for 1987-92 to
describe these crimes.  

Crime victimizations occurring in the workplace cost about half
a million employees 1,751,100 days of work each year, an average
of 3.5 days per crime.  This missed work resulted in over $55
million in lost wages annually, not including days covered by
sick and annual leave.

Annually, 1987-92--

*Nearly 1 million violent victimizations ocurred while victims
were working on duty

*These victimizations resulted in almost 160,000 injuries

                              Average annual number of
Type of crime               Victimizations     Injuries
Crimes of violence           971,517           159,094
  Rape*                        13,068            3,438
  Robbery                      79,109           17,904
  Aggravated assault          264,174           48,180
  Simple assault              615,160           89,572

*Injuries are those in addition to the rape.

*Among people victimized while working, men were more likely
than women to experience a violent crime.  However, women were
just as likely as men to become the victims of theft while
working

*Victims who were working were as likely to face armed offenders
as those victimized while not working.  Over 30% of victims who
were working during a violent victimization faced armed
offenders.  Almost a third of these offenders had a handgun.

Victims of violence at work were less likely to be injured than
victims of violence that occurred away from work.  Sixteen
percent of violent victimizations which occurred while the
victim was working resulted in physical injuries; 10% of these
injuries required medical care.

*Among only those persons injured by a crime victimization at
work, an estimated 876,800 workdays were lost annually, costing
employees over $16 million in wages, not including days covered
by sick and annual leave.

*6 out of 10 incidents of workplace violence occurred in private
companies.  While government employees make up approximately 18%
of the total U.S. workforce, 30% of the victims of violence in
this sample were Federal, State, or local government employees. 
Several factors may be responsible for this overrepresentation,
including a potentially high risk of victimization for
particular government occupations, such as public safety
personnel. 

*Although men who were victimized while working were more likely
to be attacked by a stranger, women were more likely to be
attacked by someone known to them.  Five percent of the women
victimized at work were attacked by a husband, ex-husband,
boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend.

*Over half of all victimizations sustained at work were not
reported to police.  When individuals were asked why they did
not report, 40% said they believed the incident to be a minor or
a private matter.  An additional 27% did not report to police
because they reported the victimization to another official,
such as a company security guard.

The National Crime Victimization Survey conducts interviews with over
100,000 individuals age 12 or older annually.  Respondents who
reported a violent victimization and said they were either working or
on duty when asked, "What were you doing when the incident happened?"
represent the sample for this report.  This group does not include
those victims who said they were on their way to or from work.  For
more information about the NCVS methodology, see Criminal
Victimization in the United States, 1992, NCJ-145125, March 1994.
*Although men who were victimized while working were more likely to be
attacked by a stranger, women were more likely to be attacked by
someone known to them.  Five percent of the women victimized at work
were attacked by a husband, ex-husband, boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend.

*Over half of all victimizations sustained at work were not
reported to police.  When individuals were asked why they did
not report, 40% said they believed the incident to be a minor or
a private matter.  An additional 27% did not report to police
because they reported the victimization to another official,
