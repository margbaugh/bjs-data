* 19% of State prison inmates, 10% of Federal inmates, and 16%
of those in local jails and on probation had been physically or
sexually abused before their most recent admission to a
correctional population.

*  A third of women in State prison, a sixth in Federal prison,
and a quarter in jail said they had been raped.  Another 3-6%
reported that someone had tried to rape them but had not
succeeded.

* 9 in 10 knew their abuser.

* 9 in 10 abused men and women in State prison had used illegal
drugs.  76% of the men and 80% of the women used them regularly.

* Two thirds had been injured in a fight or assault.

In recent surveys completed by the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
19% of State prison inmates, 10% of Federal inmates, and 16% of
those in local jails or on active probation told interviewers
they had been physically or sexually abused before their current
sentence.  Just under half of the women in correctional
populations and a tenth of the men indicated past abuse.  The
survey questions largely relied on respondents to define for
themselves physical and sexual abuse.

For women, abuse as children more likely in correctional than
general population 

Between 6% and 14% of male offenders and between 23% and 37% of
female offenders reported they had been physically or sexually
abused before age 18.   For the general U.S. population,
prevalence estimates of child abuse vary, depending on
definitions, types of questions, selection of study subjects,
and response rates.  A review of 16 studies estimated that for
the general adult population 5% to 8% of males and 12% to 17% of
females were abused as children.  (See page 4 for Gorey-Leslie
article reference.)  

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Sources of data

In four BJS surveys -- the 1997 Surveys of Inmates in State or
Federal Correctional Facilities, the 1996 Survey of Inmates in
Local Jails, and the 1995 Survey of Adults on Probation --
offenders selected through nationally representative samples
responded to questions in hour-long interviews.  These offenders
reported past physical or sexual abuse, offense histories, drug
and alcohol use, and personal and family characteristics.  See
page 3 for information on obtaining the survey methodologies.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Abused males reported being mistreated as children, but females,
as both children and adults

For all correctional populations, men who reported abuse
generally had been age 17 or younger when they suffered the
abuse.

Women, however, were abused as both juveniles
and adults.  Depending on the correctional population, a quarter
to a third of women were abused as juveniles; a quarter to
almost a half, as adults.  Twenty-five percent of the female
State prisoners were abused as both juveniles and adults, as
were 16% of women in jail, 14% in Federal prison, and 13% on
probation.  If abused, almost all persons of both sexes were
victimized by an adult rather than by a juvenile.  Only 1% or
less reported only being victimized by persons 17 or younger. 

Abuse of men was by family members, but abuse of women 
by family members and intimates

About 9 in 10 of the surveyed persons who reported past abuse
also said they had known at least 1 of their abusers (table 2).

Note:  Detail does not add to totals because some were abused by more than 1 person.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Family members were the primary abusers of the men:  a parent,
guardian, or other relative was identified by 57% to 70%. 
Wives, ex-wives, and girlfriends were identified by 3% to 7%.  

Female inmates and probationers were abused by both intimates
and family members.  Except for women in jail, most abused women
reported their abusers to have been current or prior husbands or
boyfriends:  61% of abused women in State prison, 66% in Federal
prison, 57% on probation, and 43% in local jails.  A parent,
guardian, or other relative had abused about a third to a half
of the reporting women.

Prisoners' prior abuse related 
to their family background 

Prisoners reported higher levels of abuse if they grew up in
foster care rather than with parents, if their parents were
heavy users of alcohol or drugs, or if a family member had been
in jail or prison.

Nonparental care.   Forty-four percent  of male prisoners and
87% of female prisoners who had spent their childhood in foster
care or institutions reported abuse.  Many of these inmates may
have been removed from abusive homes.  There is little
difference in the percentage of abused inmates growing up with
one parent and those with two.

Parental drinking.   Of those who had grown up with a parent or
guardian who drank heavily or used drugs regularly, 29% of the
men and 76%  of the women reported prior abuse.  

Incarcerated relative.   Abuse was reported for about 20% of
male inmates and 64% of female inmates who had a family member
(including boyfriend and girlfriend) who had ever served time.

Reported past abuse associated with violent crime 

Abused State prisoners were more likely than those not abused to
be serving a sentence for a violent crime.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Among State prisoners, 61% of abused men were serving a sentence for
a violent offense, compared to 46% of those reporting no past
mistreatment.  Thirty-four percent of abused women and 21% of
women  not abused were in prison for a  violent offense.

A past of abuse is specifically linked to sexual assault and
homicide.  Among men reporting abuse before prison, 19% were
serving a sentence for sexual assault, including rape, compared
to 7% of the men not abused.  Higher percentages of prisoners
had committed homicide if they reported abuse (men, 16%, and
women, 14%) than if they reported no abuse (men, 13%, and women,
7%).   

When the category of violent crime overall is broadened to
include both current and past offenses, an association between
abuse and violent offenses remains.  Among male State prison
inmates, 77% of those reporting past abuse and 61% of those
without that history had ever been sentenced for a violent
crime.  About 45% of abused women in State prison and 29% of
those not abused had served at least one sentence for a violent
crime. 

The reported use of illegal drugs and alcohol higher among abused

Illegal drug use and regular drinking were more common among
abused State prison inmates than among those who said they were
not abused.  An estimated 76% of abused men and 80% of abused
women had used illegal drugs regularly, compared to 68% of men
and 65% of women who had not been abused.  About 69% of abused
men and 58% of abused women reported drinking regularly at some
time in their lives, compared to 60% of men and 38% of women 
who were not abused.  

Abused State inmates were more likely than those reporting no
abuse to have been using alcohol or illegal drugs at the time of
their offense.  This pattern occurred especially among female
inmates.  Forty-six percent of the abused women committed their
current offense under the influence of illegal drugs; 33% were
drinking.  Among women who were not abused, 32% committed their
offense while on drugs and 24%, while drinking. 

Inmates and probationers answered 
surveys about their abuse

Data for this report were taken from four BJS surveys:  the
Surveys of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities,
1997; the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, 1996; and the Survey
of Adults on Probation, 1995.  In all four surveys nationally
representative samples of inmates or probationers were
interviewed about their current offense and sentence, criminal
history, personal and family back- ground, and prior drug and
alcohol use and treatment.

Descriptions of methodology, sample design, and standard error
calculations can be found in the following:  Substance Abuse and
Treatment of State and Federal Prisoners, 1997 (NCJ 172871);
Profile of Jail Inmates, 1996 (NCJ 164620); and Substance Abuse
and Treatment of Adults on Probation, 1995 (NCJ 166611).

In the probation and jail inmate surveys, past the interview's
midpoint, each respondent was asked, "Have you ever been
physically or sexually abused?"  Inmates in the surveys in State
and Federal correctional facilities were asked if "anyone ever
pressured or forced you to have any sexual contact against your
will, that is, touching of genitals" and for females, "breast,
or buttocks, or oral, anal, or vaginal sex?@ and for males "or
oral or anal sex?"  In a separate question they were asked if
they had "ever been physically abused?"

Question wording and respondent sensitivity affect level of
reported abuse

The BJS survey questions rely on respondents to define abuse
within the context of their own lives, to recall their pasts,
and to report what they remember.  Factors can intervene so that
the reported experiences do not match the actual experiences. 
For example, respondents may be unwilling to admit that
sensitive events occurred, may be reluctant to report abuse to
others, may distrust interviewers or surveys, may forget, or may
purposefully misrepresent.  

In contrast, most studies of abuse in the general population
have used a battery of questions listing specific kinds of
experiences, some of which are then classified as abuse by the
analyst.  These questions elicit events respondents may not
recognize as abuse and impose the analysts' definitions of abuse
upon respondents' experiences.  These differences in definition
and measurement should be taken into account when comparing the
results of various surveys.

Low response rates, as well as broad definitions, have been
found to produce high estimates of abuse, while high response
rates and narrow definitions produce low estimates.  For a
discussion of the effects of question wording and response rates
on estimates of abuse in the general population, see Kevin M.
Gooey and Donald R. Leslie, "The Prevalence of Child Sexual
Abuse:  Integrative Review Adjustment for Potential Response and
Measurement Biases," Child Abuse and Neglect, 21, pp. 391-98,
1997.

Gallop Poll estimates of abuse for the general population are
based on questions similar to those asked in the correctional
population surveys.  See the Source book of Criminal Justice
Statistics, 1990, 1993, and 1995, for tables from the poll.  The
following were general adult population responses about
childhood experiences:  9%, raped by an older child  or an
adult;  5% of men and 10% of women, kicked, punched, or choked 
by a parent or guardian; and 13% of men and 10% of women,
physically abused by their parents.

In recent surveys completed by the Bureau of Justice Statistics,
19% of State prison inmates, 10% of Federal inmates, and 16% of
those in local jails or on active probation told interviewers
they had been physically or sexually abused before their current
sentence.  Just under half of the women in correctional
populations and a tenth of the men indicated past abuse.  The
survey questions largely relied on respondents to define for
themselves physical and sexual abuse.
