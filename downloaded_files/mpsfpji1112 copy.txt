Medical Problems of State and Federal Prisoners 
and Jail Inmates, 2011–12

Laura M. Maruschak, BJS Statistician
Marcus Berzofsky, Dr. P.H., and Jennifer Unangst, 
RTI International

In 2011–12, half of state and federal prisoners and local jail 
inmates reported ever having a chronic condition (figure 1). 
Chronic conditions include cancer, high blood pressure, stroke-
related problems, diabetes, heart-related problems, kidney-
related problems, arthritis, asthma, and cirrhosis of the liver. 
Twenty-one percent of prisoners and 14% of jail inmates reported 
ever having an infectious disease, including tuberculosis, 
hepatitis B and C, and other sexually transmitted diseases 
(STDs). About 1% of prisoners and jail inmates who had been 
tested for HIV reported being HIV positive.

This report uses data from the 2011–12 National Inmate Survey 
(NIS-3) to describe the health status and the health services and 
treatment received by state and federal prisoners and local jail 
inmates. Data from the 2009–2012 National Survey on Drug Use and 
Health (NSDUH) were used to compare the incarcerated populations 
to the general population. The general population was 
standardized twice, once to match the prison population and once 
to match the jail population by sex, age, race, and Hispanic 
origin. Standardizing the general population to the inmate 
population controls for differences in the distributions of sex, 
age, and race, and Hispanic origin, which are important risk 
factors for medical problems. Standardization removes the effect 
of sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin when comparing the 
prevalence of medical conditions between the incarcerated 
populations and the general population. However, it does not 
remove the effect of other factors associated with both 
incarceration status and outcome. The report details the 
prevalence of specific chronic conditions and infectious diseases 
and highlights important differences in the rates of each by 
demographic characteristics. It examines treatment received by 
inmates with health problems and describes inmate satisfaction 
with health services received while incarcerated.

Highlights
****************

* In 2011–12, half (51%) of prisoners and jail inmates (50%) 
reported ever having a chronic condition.

*Twenty-one percent of prisoners and 14% of jail inmates reported 
ever having tuberculosis, hepatitis B or C, or other STDs 
(excluding HIV or AIDS).

* Both prisoners and jail inmates were more likely than the 
general population to report ever having a chronic condition or 
infectious disease. The same finding held true for each specific 
condition or infectious disease. 

* Among prisoners and jail inmates, females were more likely than 
males to report ever having a chronic condition.
High blood pressure was the most common chronic condition 
reported by prisoners (30%) and jail inmates (26%).

* The majority of prisoners (74%) and jail inmates (62%) were 
overweight, obese, or morbidly obese.

* While female prisoners and jail inmates were less likely than 
males to be overweight, they were more likely to be obese or 
morbidly obese. 

* About 66% of prisoners and 40% of jail inmates with a chronic 
condition at the time of interview reported taking prescription 
medication.

* The majority of prisoners reported having been tested for HIV 
(71%) and for tuberculosis (94%) since admission. Among jail 
inmates, 11% had been tested for HIV and 54% for tuberculosis.

* Seventeen jurisdictions reported testing all inmates for HIV 
during the intake process, 11 reported opt-out testing, and 10 
reported opt-in testing.

* More than half of prisoners (56%) and jail inmates (51%) said 
that they were either very satisfied or somewhat satisfied with 
the health care services received since admission.

***************************************
Prisoners and jail inmates were more 
likely than the general population to 
report ever having a chronic condition 
or an infectious disease
***************************************

When compared to the general population, both prisoners and jail 
inmates were more likely to report ever having a chronic 
condition, and they were more likely to report each of the 
specific chronic conditions measured. When compared to the 
general population, the measure of ever having a chronic 
condition excludes cancer, kidney-related problems, and arthritis 
or rheumatism because data were not collected on these chronic 
conditions in the NSDUH. Forty-four percent of prisoners reported 
ever having a chronic condition, compared to 31% of persons in 
the general population (table 1). Prisoners were about 1.5 times 
more likely than persons in the standardized general population 
to report ever having high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma. 
About 45% of jail inmates reported ever having a chronic 
condition, compared to 27% of the standardized general population 
(table 2). Jail inmates were nearly two times more likely than 
persons in the general population to report ever having high 
blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma.

An estimated 21% of prisoners and 14% of jail inmates reported 
ever having tuberculosis, hepatitis, or other STDs excluding HIV 
or AIDS, compared to 5% of the general population.***FOOTNOTE 1: 
In the NSDUH, hepatitis includes all types. In the NIS-3, 
hepatitis includes hepatitis B and hepatitis C.*** For each type 
of infectious disease, prisoners and jail inmates were more 
likely than those in the general population to report ever having 
that infectious disease.

***************************************************************

**********************************
Difference between ever having 
and currently having chronic 
medical conditions
**********************************

Estimates of chronic medical conditions among state and
federal prisoners and jail inmates are based on self-reported
information in the National Inmate Survey (NIS-3). Inmates
were asked whether a doctor, nurse, or other health care
provider ever told them they had select noninfectious medical
conditions which were categorized as chronic conditions.
Chronic medical conditions involve persistent health
problems that have long-lasting effects, and include but are
not limited to the select conditions that were asked about in
the NIS-3. This measure indicated a diagnosis of having the
condition at least once in their lifetime, but does not mean
that the inmate currently has the medical condition. As a
measure of current medical conditions in the NIS-3, inmates
were also asked at the time of the interview whether a doctor,
nurse, or other health care provider had told them they
currently had select noninfectious medical conditions.

The data show that an estimated 50% of prisoners and jail
inmates reported ever having a chronic condition compared
to 40% currently having a chronic condition. The percentage
of inmates who reported currently having a chronic condition
was lower than those who reported ever having a chronic
condition because over time, a past condition may have
been resolved, gone into remission, or no longer required
treatment. The measure of ever having a chronic medical
condition indicates the percentage of inmates who are
potentially at risk for future medical problems while the
measure of current condition indicates the percentage of
inmates who may have needed health care services at the
time of interview.
***************************************************************

******************************************
High blood pressure was the most commonly 
reported chronic condition among prisoners 
and jail inmates
******************************************

Similar to the standardized general population, the most commonly 
reported chronic condition reported by both prisoners and jail 
inmates was high blood pressure. Nearly a third (30%) of 
prisoners and more than a quarter (26%) of jail inmates reported 
high blood pressure. Asthma (15% for prisoners and 20% for jail 
inmates) and arthritis (15% for prisoners and 13% for jail 
inmates) were the second and third most common chronic 
conditions.

Among prisoners, hepatitis C was the most commonly reported 
infectious disease (10%), followed by tuberculosis and STDs (6% 
each). Among jail inmates, nearly 6% reported ever having 
hepatitis C, 6% ever had some other STD, and 2% ever had 
tuberculosis. About 1% of both prisoners and jail inmates who 
were tested reported having HIV or AIDS.

******************************************
Chronic conditions were more commonly 
reported by female inmates both 
in prisons and jails
******************************************

Female prisoners and jail inmates were more likely than males to 
report ever having a chronic condition (table 3). About two-
thirds of females in both prisons (63%) and jails (67%) reported 
ever having a chronic condition, compared to half of males in 
prisons (50%) and jails (48%). In prisons, 25% of females and 21% 
of males reported ever having an infectious disease. In jails, 
20% of females reported ever having an infectious disease, 
compared to 13% of males.

Hispanic prisoners and jail inmates were less likely than white 
and black prisoners and jail inmates to report ever having an 
infectious disease. About 57% of white, 52% of black, and 41% of 
Hispanic prisoners reported ever having a chronic condition. 
Similarly, 54% of white, 50% of black, and 37% of Hispanic jail 
inmates reported ever having a chronic condition. White prisoners 
were almost 1.5 times more likely than black prisoners to report 
ever having an infectious disease. About 15% of both white and 
black jail inmates reported ever having an infectious disease, 
compared to 10% of Hispanic inmates.

******************************************
Older prisoners were about 3 times more 
likely than younger persons to report 
ever having a chronic condition or 
infectious disease
******************************************

Older prisoners and jail inmates were more likely than younger 
persons to report ever having a chronic condition or infectious 
disease. Prisoners age 50 or older were about 2.5 times more 
likely than those ages 18 to 24 to report ever having a chronic 
condition. Similarly, jail inmates age 50 or older were about 2 
times more likely than those ages 18 to 24 to report ever having 
a chronic condition. About 1 in 10 prisoners and jail inmates 
ages 18 to 24 reported ever having an infectious disease. 
Prisoners (35%) and jail inmates (30%) age 50 or older were about 
3 times more likely to report having an infectious disease than 
those ages 18 to 24.

***************************************************************

******************************************
Rates of high blood pressure and diabetes 
increased among prisoners and jail inmates
******************************************

In the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) 2002 Survey of Inmates 
in Local Jails and 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal 
Correctional Facilities, inmates were asked a series of questions 
to determine if they ever had or at the time of interview had a 
chronic condition. Inmates were also asked about specific chronic 
conditions. The 2011–12 National Inmate Survey (NIS-3) included a 
more restricted measure of ever had or currently having a chronic 
condition. In the NIS-3, inmates were asked if a doctor, nurse, 
or other health care provider ever told them that they had a 
certain chronic condition and, if a doctor, nurse, or health care 
provider told them that they currently had the chronic condition. 
Although the NIS-3 collected a more conservative measure, 
prevalence estimates of some common chronic conditions were 
higher in 2011–12 than 2002 and 2004, indicating true increases 
have occurred over time.

Between 2004 and 2011–12, rates of high blood pressure and 
diabetes rose among prisoners (figure 2). The rate of diabetes in 
2011–12 (899 per 10,000 prisoners) was almost twice the rate in 
2004 (483 per 10,000). The rate of high blood pressure (3,020 per 
10,000 prisoners) was almost 1.5 times the rate in 2004 (2,093 
per 10,000). Similar rates were observed for asthma, arthritis, 
and heart-related problems. Although data suggest stability in 
these rates, caution should be taken when interpreting data, as 
the methodology was updated for 2011–12.

Similar trends were observed among jail inmates (figure 3). The 
2011–12 rate of jail inmates who reported ever having diabetes 
(723 per 10,000 jail inmates) was twice the 2002 rate (361 per 
10,000), and the rate of high blood pressure in 2011–12 was 
almost 1.5 times higher than the rate in 2002. The rate of asthma 
also rose between 2002 and 2011–12, from 1,502 per 10,000 jail 
inmates to 2,012 per 10,000. Although data suggest that the rates 
of arthritis and heart-related problems among jail inmates were 
relatively stable, caution should be taken when interpreting 
data, as the methodology was updated for 2011–12.
***************************************************************

***************************************************************

**********************************
Rate of HIV or AIDS in state 
and federal prisons continued 
to decline
**********************************

Based on data from administrative records reported through BJS’s 
National Prisoner Statistics (NPS-1) data collection, 18,945 
state and federal prisoners were infected with HIV or had 
confirmed AIDS in 2012—down from 19,536 in 2011 (appendix table 
1). Between 2011 and 2012, the estimated rate of HIV or AIDS 
declined from 145 per 10,000 prisoners to 143 per 10,000. This 
decline is consistent with declines observed over the previous 
decades (figure 4).
*************************************************************

**********************************
24% of prisoners and jail inmates 
reported at least 
two chronic conditions
**********************************

In 2012, nearly a quarter (24%) of both prisoners and jail 
inmates reported ever having multiple chronic conditions (table 
4). About 7% of prisoners and 4% of jail inmates reported high 
blood pressure and diabetes—two chronic conditions that are risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease. About 12% of prisoners and 9% 
of jail inmates reported ever having a chronic condition and an 
infectious disease. Among prisoners and jail inmates who reported 
ever having hepatitis B, about 15% reported ever having cirrhosis 
of the liver. About 11% of those in both populations who ever had 
hepatitis C reported that they had cirrhosis of the liver.

****************************************************************

*********************************************
Majority of prisoners and jail inmates
were either overweight, obese, or 
morbidly obese***FOOTNOTE 2: This finding 
is consistent with the general population 
of adults age 20 or older (Health, 
United States, 2013, Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention).***
********************************************

In 2011–12, nearly three-quarters of prisoners were either 
overweight (46%), obese (26%), or morbidly obese (2%), with about 
a quarter of prisoners being either normal weight (26%) or 
underweight (1%) (table 5). Measures of overweight, obese, and 
morbidly obese were calculated using the body mass index (see 
Methodology). Female prisoners (35%) were less likely than males 
(47%) to be overweight. However, female (43%) prisoners were more 
likely than males (27%) to be either obese or morbidly obese 
(appendix table 2). Prisoners ages 18 to 24 were less likely than 
all other age groups to be obese. About 14% of prisoners ages 18 
to 24 were obese, compared to 20% of those ages 25 to 34, 33% of 
those ages 35 to 49, and 25% of those age 50 or older. Black 
prisoners (29%) were more likely than white prisoners (23%) to be 
obese.

In 2011–12, more than 6 in 10 jail inmates were either overweight 
(39%), obese (20%), or morbidly obese (2%), while about 4 in 10 
jail inmates were either normal weight (37%) or underweight (1%). 
Female (32%) jail inmates were less likely than males (40%) to be 
overweight. However, female (37%) jail inmates were more likely 
than males (20%) to be either obese or morbidly obese (appendix 
table 3). Similar to prisoners, jail inmates ages 18 to 24 were 
less likely than all other age groups to be obese. About 13% of 
jail inmates ages 18 to 24 were obese, compared to 19% of those 
ages 25 to 34, 27% of those ages 35 to 49, and 22% of those age 
50 or older. About 44% of Hispanic jail inmates reported being 
overweight—the highest percentage among all racial or ethnic 
categories. About 1 in 5 jail inmates in each racial category was 
obese. Black jail inmates (3%) were more likely than white jail 
inmates (1%) to be morbidly obese.
***************************************************************

**************************************
Most prisoners and jail inmates 
received medical assessments 
or exams since admission
**************************************

Prisoners were more likely than jail inmates to report being 
assessed and questioned about medical issues at time of 
admission; to have seen a doctor, nurse, or health care 
professional for any medical reason; or to have been tested for 
infectious diseases (table 6). An estimated 85% of prisoners were 
questioned by staff about their health or medical history, 
compared to 82% of jail inmates. About two-thirds of prisoners 
(64%) and half (50%) of jail inmates reported being assessed by 
staff to see if they were sick, injured, or intoxicated.

An estimated 80% of prisoners and 47% of jail inmates reported 
seeing a health care professional for a medical reason since 
admission. Prisoners (71%) were about 6.5 times more likely than 
jail inmates (11%) to be tested for HIV. Among prisoners, 57% 
were tested for hepatitis B and 54% were tested for hepatitis C, 
compared to 6% for both among jail inmates. Almost all prisoners 
(94%) reported being tested for tuberculosis since admission, 
compared to about half (54%) of jail inmates.

***************************************************************

***************************************
About a third of jurisdictions reported 
testing all inmates on entry
***************************************

In 2012, as part of the prison intake process, 17 jurisdictions 
reported that they test all inmates for HIV, 11 reported that 
they offer opt-out HIV testing (i.e., all inmates are offered the 
test, and the test is given unless the inmate declines the test), 
and 10 reported opt-in HIV testing (i.e., all inmates are offered 
the test, and the test is given if the inmate wants to be 
tested). The remaining jurisdictions either had some other 
practice for testing, did not test, or did not report the testing 
practice in their jurisdiction (appendix table 4).

Thirty-two percent of prisoners were held in the jurisdictions 
that reported testing all inmates for HIV, 26% were held in the 
jurisdictions reporting opt-out testing, and 15% were held in the 
jurisdictions that reported opt-in testing. The remaining quarter 
of prisoners were held in jurisdictions that either reported 
other testing circumstances or did not report their testing 
practices.

Among the 10 jurisdictions offering opt-in testing, consent 
specifically for HIV testing was obtained in 9 jurisdictions, and 
general consent for medical services was obtained in 1 
jurisdiction. For jurisdictions with opt-out testing, type of 
consent for testing was not consistent. Three jurisdictions 
obtained consent specifically for HIV testing, six jurisdictions 
obtained consent for medical services, one jurisdiction did not 
obtain any consent, and one jurisdiction did not report type of 
consent.

In 2012, the majority of jurisdictions reported testing inmates 
in custody who requested an HIV test (42), if there was clinical 
indication (39), who were involved in an incident (34), and who 
were under court order (32) (appendix table 5). Twenty 
jurisdictions reported offering HIV testing during routine 
medical exams, and 19 offered testing to high-risk inmates.

On discharge, most jurisdictions (24) provided inmates with an 
HIV test, if requested (appendix table 6). Seven jurisdictions 
offered an HIV test to all inmates being released, three offered 
an HIV test to some inmates, and six reported that they did not 
provide HIV testing on discharge.
****************************************************************

***************************************
Among prisoners and jail inmates 
who reported ever having a chronic 
condition, about three-quarters
reported having a chronic condition 
at admission
***************************************

Among those who reported ever having a chronic condition, 73% of 
prisoners and 77% of jail inmates reported that they had a 
condition at admission (figure 5). Both prisoners and jail 
inmates were more likely to report a chronic condition at 
admission than since admission. Among those who reported ever 
having a chronic condition, about a quarter (27%) of prisoners 
and a tenth (8%) of jail inmates did not report a chronic 
condition at admission, but were told that they had the condition 
since admission. Prisoners and jail inmates who had a chronic 
condition at admission were equally likely to report taking 
prescription medication or receiving some other type of treatment 
in the 30 days prior to admission (table 7). In both populations, 
about 6 in 10 reported taking prescription medication and more 
than 3 in 10 reported receiving some other type of treatment.

************************************
66% of prisoners and 40% of jail 
inmates with a current chronic 
condition reported taking 
prescription medication
************************************

In 2011–12, about 4 in 10 prisoners (41%) and jail inmates (40%) 
reported having a chronic condition at the time of interview 
(appendix table 7). Among prisoners with a chronic condition at 
time of interview, 66% reported that they were taking 
prescription medication, and 20% said they were receiving some 
other type of medical treatment. Although inmates could report 
multiple reasons for not taking prescription medication, 
prisoners most commonly cited reasons related to lack of health 
services or doctor’s provision of a prescription. More than a 
third (36%) of prisoners who were not taking prescription 
medication said that the doctor did not think medication was 
necessary or that the facility would not provide the medication, 
while about 20% reported that they had not seen a doctor. About 
19% of prisoners reported that they did not think the medication 
was necessary, and about 11% reported that they did not like 
taking the medication. Among prisoners who were HIV positive, 84% 
reported taking prescription medication.

Jail inmates who reported having a chronic condition at the time 
of interview were less likely than prisoners to report taking 
prescription medication or receiving some other type of medical 
treatment. About 40% of jail inmates with a chronic condition at 
the time of interview reported that they were receiving 
prescription medication, and 14% reported receiving some other 
type of medical treatment. Similar to prisoners, jail inmates 
most commonly reported reasons for not taking prescription 
medication that were related to lack of health services or 
doctor’s provision of a prescription. More than a third (39%) of 
jail inmates who were not taking prescription medication reported 
that they had not seen a doctor and 36% said the doctor did not 
think medication was necessary or the facility would not provide 
the medication. Nearly a third (31%) of jail inmates said that 
they did not think the medication was necessary, and 16% reported 
that they did not like taking the medication. Among jail inmates 
who were HIV positive, 66% reported taking prescription 
medication.

****************************************
More than half of prisoners and jail
inmates reported being somewhat 
or very satisfied with health care 
services received since admission
****************************************

In 2011–12, 13% of prisoners were very satisfied with the health 
services received since admission and 44% were somewhat satisfied 
(table 8). Among jail inmates, 14% were very satisfied with the 
health services received since admission and 37% were somewhat 
satisfied. Jail inmates (49%) were more likely than prisoners 
(44%) to report not being satisfied with the health care services 
received since admission.

Nearly half (48%) of prisoners and 43% of jail inmates reported 
that the health care received while incarcerated was better than 
or about the same as the care they received in the 12 months 
prior to admission.

Methodology
**************

National Inmate Survey
************************

The 2011–12 National Inmate Survey (NIS-3) was conducted in 233 
state and federal prisons, 358 local jails, and 15 special 
facilities (i.e., military facilities, Indian country jails, and 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities) between 
February 2011 and May 2012. Data were collected by RTI 
International under a cooperative agreement with the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics (BJS).

The NIS-3 administered two questionnaires to inmates—a survey 
about sexual victimization and a survey about mental and physical 
health, past drug and alcohol use, and treatment for substance 
abuse. Inmates were randomly assigned to receive one of two 
questionnaires to ensure that the content of the survey remained 
unknown to facility staff and the interviewers at the time of the 
interview.

A total of 106,532 inmates participated in the NIS-3, receiving 
either the sexual victimization survey or the randomly assigned 
companion survey. Combined, the surveys were administered to 
43,721 inmates in state and federal prisons, 61,351 inmates in 
jails, 605 inmates in military facilities, 192 inmates in Indian 
country jails, and 663 inmates in ICE facilities.

The interviews, which averaged 35 minutes in length, used 
computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and audio 
computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) data collection 
methods. For approximately the first 2 minutes, interviewers 
conducted a personal interview using CAPI to obtain background 
information and date of admission to the facility. For the 
remainder of the interview, inmates interacted with a computer-
administered questionnaire using a touchscreen and synchronized 
audio instructions delivered via headphones. Respondents 
completed the ACASI portion of the interview in private, with the 
interviewer either leaving the room or moving away from the 
computer.

A shorter paper questionnaire was made available for inmates who 
were unable to come to the private interviewing room or interact 
with the computer. The paper form was completed by 751 state and 
federal prisoners (1.9% of all prisoner interviews) and 264 jail 
inmates (0.5% of all jail inmate interviews). Inmates who 
completed the paper form were not asked about their physical 
health, mental health, past drug and alcohol use, or treatment 
for substance abuse.

Additional information on the methodology for sample selection of 
facilities and inmates can be found in the report, Sexual 
Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2011–12 
(NCJ 241399, BJS web, May 2013).

In this report, the analysis of the physical health module was 
restricted to adult inmates in prisons or jails. Therefore, this 
report excludes juvenile inmates ages 16 or 17 and inmates in 
military facilities, Indian country jails, or ICE facilities.

Administration of the physical 
health module
********************************

The physical health module was administered to participating 
inmates in the NIS-3 for one of two reasons--

1. to ensure the sexual victimization survey length was similar 
for all participating inmates

2. as part of the alternative survey on mental and physical 
health, past drug and alcohol use, and treatment for substance 
abuse.

Among inmates who received the sexual victimization survey (90% 
of inmates surveyed), a brief physical health module was randomly 
assigned to half of the inmates who participated. Among those 
inmates, respondents who completed the core sexual victimization 
survey in 33 minutes or less received the brief physical health 
module. Based on the time criteria, 11,671 state and federal 
prisoners (67% of the prisoners who would have been randomly 
assigned the brief physical health module) and 17,130 jail 
inmates (69% of the jail inmates who would have been randomly 
assigned the brief physical health module) completed the brief 
physical health module.

Among inmates who received the alternative survey on mental and 
physical health, past drug and alcohol use, and treatment for 
substance abuse (10% of inmates surveyed), the full physical 
health module was administered to those who completed the mental 
health and disabilities modules in 30 minutes or less. Of the 
4,304 inmates randomized to the alternative survey, 3,833 (89%) 
inmates received and completed the full physical health module. 
Among the 6,704 jail inmates randomized to the alternative 
survey, 5,494 inmates (90%) received and completed the full 
physical health module.

The module on physical health, which was administered through 
ACASI, relied on inmates reporting their direct experiences. The 
brief physical health module asked the inmate about the types of 
medical services received at the time of admission and about any 
medical conditions (i.e., chronic diseases and infectious 
diseases) the inmate ever had, had at the time of admission, and 
had developed since admission. The full physical health module 
asked the same questions contained in the brief physical module, 
plus additional items on the types of services and treatments 
received by inmates with a medical condition and when those 
services and treatments were received. The entire ACASI 
questionnaire (listed as the National Inmate Survey-3) is 
available on the BJS website.

Nonresponse bias analysis to assess 
feasibility of using the 90% or 10% 
sample in the NIS-3
************************************

To produce reliable national-level statistics, a nonresponse bias 
analysis was needed to assess the feasibility of using data in 
the physical health module from the sexual victimization survey 
(90% sample) and the alternative survey (10% sample). Bias arises 
when subjects with characteristics associated with the outcome of 
interest are either overrepresented or underrepresented, 
resulting in the estimated prevalence of an outcome being 
different from the actual prevalence of the outcome. Because not 
everybody responded to the physical health module, it might be 
that respondents differ from nonrespondents in significant ways. 
Because the time to complete earlier modules in the survey was a 
major factor in determining whether the respondent was 
administered the physical health module, those who did not 
receive the physical health module may be different than those 
who did. The time requirements may have biased the physical 
health estimates, making them no longer nationally representative 
of all inmates.

To assess the potential bias in both the sexual victimization 
survey (90%) and alternative survey (10%) administered in the 
NIS-3, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted for those who 
received the physical health module and those who did not. For 
the sexual victimization survey, differences in response status 
to the physical health module were assessed by whether or not an 
inmate had been sexually victimized, language of the interview 
(i.e., English or Spanish), whether or not an inmate reported a 
mental health problem and the interaction of victimization and 
mental health status. For the alternative survey, differences in 
response status to the physical health module were assessed by 
language of the interview (i.e., English or Spanish), whether an 
inmate reported a mental health problem, and the interaction of 
language of interview and mental health status.

Key findings from the nonresponse bias analysis for respondents 
to the sexual victimization survey include--

* For both prisons and jails, inmates who reported a sexual 
victimization were significantly less likely than inmates who did 
not report a sexual victimization to receive and complete the 
brief physical health module (p-value less than 0.0001 for 
prisoners and jail inmates).

* For both prisons and jails, inmates who responded to the survey 
in Spanish were significantly less likely than those who 
responded in English to receive and complete the brief physical 
health module (p-value less than 0.0001 for prisoners and jail 
inmates).

* For both prisons and jails, inmates who reported a mental 
health condition were significantly less likely than those who 
did not report a mental health condition to receive and complete 
the brief physical health module (p-value less than 0.0001 for 
prisoners and jail inmates).

* Among prisoners and jail inmates who reported a sexual 
victimization, inmates who reported a mental health condition 
were significantly less likely than inmates who did not report 
a mental health condition to receive and complete the brief 
physical health module (p-value less than 0.0001 for prisoners 
and jail inmates).

* Among prisoners, 1.5% (177 of 11,671 respondents) reported 
a sexual victimization, reported a mental health condition, and 
received and completed the brief physical health module.
Among jail inmates, 1.1% (190 of 17,130 respondents) reported 
a sexual victimization, reported a mental health condition, and 
received and completed the brief physical health module.

Key findings from the nonresponse bias analysis for respondents 
to the alternative survey include--

* For both prisons and jails, inmates who reported a mental 
health condition were significantly less likely than inmates who 
did not report a mental health condition to receive and complete 
the full physical health module (p-value less than 0.0001 for 
prisoners and jail inmates). However, among those with a mental 
health condition, 92.0% of prisoners and 86.5% of jail inmates 
received and completed the physical health module.

* In prisons, 225 inmates (5.2% of respondents) responded to the 
alternative survey in Spanish.

* In jails, 321 inmates (5.3% of respondents) responded to the 
alternative survey in Spanish.

* Among prisoners and jail inmates who responded in Spanish, 
inmates who reported a mental health condition were not 
significantly less likely than inmates who did not report a 
mental health condition to receive and complete the full physical 
health module (p-values of 0.3989 and 0.0678 for prisoners and 
jail inmates).

For the alternative survey, based on the results of the 
nonresponse bias analyses, it was determined that a weight 
adjustment could properly correct for potential bias among 
respondents to the full physical health module. However, based on 
the results of the nonresponse bias analyses for the sexual 
victimization survey, it was determined that a weight adjustment 
might not fully compensate for the potential bias among those who 
responded to the brief physical health module. Therefore, the 
analyses of the physical health data were restricted to inmates 
who completed the alternative survey.

Weighting and nonresponse adjustments
****************************************

Responses from interviewed inmates were weighted to produce 
national-level estimates. Each interviewed inmate was assigned an 
initial weight corresponding to the inverse of the probability of 
selection within each sampled facility. A series of adjustment 
factors was applied to the initial weight to minimize potential 
bias due to nonresponse and to provide national estimates. For 
the analysis of the physical health module, these adjustments 
were one of two types:

1. adjustments to account for survey nonresponse

2. adjustments to account for module nonresponse due to time 
constraints.

Methods to adjust for survey nonresponse are detailed in the 
report, Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by 
Inmates, 2011–12 (NCJ 241399, BJS web, May 2013). Once adjusted 
weights were developed to account for survey nonresponse, an 
additional weighting adjustment was conducted to account for the 
potential bias induced by nonresponse due to time constraints. 
Bias could result if the module nonrespondents were different 
from the module respondents. The adjustment for module 
nonresponse included a calibration of the weights to ensure that 
the weight from a nonresponding inmate was assigned to a 
responding inmate with similar characteristics. Because both 
respondents and nonrespondents to the physical health module 
completed part of the alternative survey, the adjustment used 
data from modules that both groups completed. These data included 
demographic, criminal history, mental health, and interview 
debriefing characteristics. This adjustment ensured that the 
estimates accurately reflected the full sample, rather than only 
the inmates who responded to the physical health module. For each 
inmate, these adjustments were based on a generalized exponential 
model, developed by Folsom and Singh (2002), and applied to the 
sexual victimization survey respondents.***FOOTNOTE 3 Folsom, 
Jr., R.E. & Singh, A.C. (2000). The Generalized Exponential Model 
for Sampling Weight Calibration for Extreme Values, Nonresponse, 
and Poststratification. Proceedings of the American Statistical 
Association, Survey Research Methods Section, pp. 598–603.***

The module nonresponse adjustment maintained the benchmark totals 
designed to make national-level estimates for the total number of 
inmates age 18 or older who were held in jails at midyear 2011 or 
in prisons at yearend 2011. These benchmark totals represented 
the estimated number of inmates by sex (from BJS’s 2011 Annual 
Survey of Jails and 2011 National Prisoner Statistics). The 
national estimates for state prisons were 1,154,600 adult males 
and 83,400 adult females; for federal prisons, 190,600 adult 
males and 13,200 adult females; and for jails (with an average 
daily population of 6 or more inmates), 628,620 adult males and 
91,551 adult females.

Standard errors and tests of significance
******************************************

As with any survey, the NIS-3 estimates are subject to error 
arising from sampling rather than using a complete enumeration of 
the population of adult inmates in prisons and jails. For each 
physical health outcome, the estimated sampling error varies by 
the size of the estimate, the number of completed interviews, and 
the intra-cluster correlation of the outcome within facilities.

A common way to express this sampling variability is to construct 
a 95% confidence interval around each survey estimate. Typically, 
multiplying the standard error by 1.96 and then adding or 
subtracting the result from the estimate produces the confidence 
interval. This interval expresses the range of values that could 
result among 95% of the different samples that could be drawn.

Chronic conditions and infectious 
disease in the general population
***********************************

Prevalence rates of chronic conditions and infectious diseases in 
the general population included in this report come from the 
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). To be most 
comparable to the inmate population included in the NIS-3, the 
survey years from 2009 to 2012 of NSDUH were used in this 
analysis. Statistical tests comparing the prevalence of chronic 
conditions and infectious diseases measured in the NIS-3 and 
NSDUH are presented in tables 1 and 2. NSDUH collects information 
on six chronic conditions (i.e., high blood pressure, stroke-
related problems, diabetes, heart disease, asthma, and cirrhosis 
of the liver) and four infectious diseases (i.e., HIV or AIDS, 
tuberculosis, hepatitis, and STDs).
 
Because the demographic makeup of the general population is 
different than that of the inmate population (i.e., the general 
population is older, more white, and more female), general 
population rates were standardized to the inmate population 
(i.e., the prison population for table 1 and the jail population 
for table 2) to assess the differences between comparable 
populations. Standardization calibrates the weights of one of the 
populations to the distribution of the other based on a set of 
specified characteristics. Standardized estimates were computed 
in SUDAAN using its standardization options in PROC DESCRIPT. For 
this analysis, the general population was standardized to inmate 
population based on sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin. The 
standardized general population estimates for disease can be 
interpreted as the estimate of disease among the general 
population, if the general population had the same sex, age, 
race, and Hispanic origin distribution as the prisoner and jail 
inmate populations.

Calculation of body mass index (BMI)
**************************************

BMI is a measurement of body fat, based on height and weight, 
that applies to both men and women ages 18 to 65. BMI can be used 
to determine if a person is underweight (18.5 or less), normal 
weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25.0 to 29.9), obese (30.0 to 
39.9), or morbidly obese (40 or greater). In the NIS-3, BMI was 
based on the following formula provided by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention:

BMI = weight (pounds) / (height (inches))2 x 703.
