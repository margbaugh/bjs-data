BJS Statistician


On December 31, 1996, State and local probation agencies
supervised more than 3 million adult U.S. residents or about 1
in every 62  persons age 18 or older.  Since 1985 the Nation's
probation population has grown an average of 3% per year. 
Probationers account for the largest share of adults under
correctional supervision (58%), including persons held in jails
and prisons and those on parole.

Highlights

****************



* In 1995 an estimated 1.5 million felons and 1 million
misdemeanants were under the supervision of State and local
probation agencies. 



* Drug trafficking (15%) and possession (13%) were the most
common offenses among felons; driving while intoxicated (35%)
and assault (11%) among misdemeanants. 



* Half of all probationers had a prior sentence to probation or
incarceration -- 30% to jail or prison and 42% to probation.



* Drug or alcohol treatment was a sentence condition for 41% of
adults on probation; 37% had received treatment.  Drug testing
was required of 32%.



* About three-quarters of the felons and two-thirds of the
misdemeanants had been contacted by a probation officer in the
last month.



* Since entering probation, nearly 1 in 5 had a formal
disciplinary hearing.  Of these, 38% had been arrested or
convicted for  a new offense, 41% had failed to report or
absconded, and 38% had failed to pay a fine or restitution.

Results from the first national survey of adults on probation
under the supervision of State and local agencies indicate that
58% had been convicted of a felony; 38% of a misdemeanor, and 3%
of other infractions.  When the survey was conducted at the
beginning of 1995, more than 453,000 adults were on probation
for a violent offense; 757,000 for a property offense; 561,000
for a drug offense; and 815,000 for a public-order offense.



Using a nationally representative sample, a two-part survey was
conducted to collect detailed information on adults on
probation.  Results from a sample of 5,867 administrative
records are presented here.  Data from personal interviews with
probationers will be the subject of a future report.

Survey of Adults on Probation, 1995

***********************************



The 1995 Survey of Adults on Probation, conducted by the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS), was the first national survey to
gather information on the individual characteristics of
probationers.  The first component of this survey consisted of a
review of the administrative records of 5,867 adult
probationers, providing detailed information on current offenses
and sentences, criminal histories, levels of supervision and
contacts, participation in treatment programs, and disciplinary
hearings and outcomes.



Administrative records were drawn from 167 State, county, and
municipal probation agencies nationwide.  Offices providing
direct supervision were selected from 16 strata defined by
government branch (executive or judicial), level (State or
local), and region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). 
Offices were selected with probabilities proportional to the
number under supervision.  (See Methodology for additional
detail.)



Only adults with a formal sentence to probation who were not
considered absconders were included in the records check. 
Excluded were persons supervised by a Federal probation agency,
those only on parole,  persons on presentence or pretrial
diversion, juveniles, and absconders. 



Systematic samples of probationers were drawn by BJS from
rosters prepared by each agency.  A probation officer or other
person familiar with the agency's records collected the data.  A
total of 5,867 records checks were completed, representing an
overall response rate of 87.4%.  Estimates for the entire
population were generated based on the original probabilities of
selection and a series of adjustments for nonresponse. 

 

************************************

Nearly 2 of 5 probationers convicted 
of a violent or drug offense

************************************



In 1995, 17% of the adults on probation had been sentenced for a
violent offense and 21% for a drug offense (table 1).

for whom information on the most serious offense was not reported.

--------------------------------------------------------

The remainder were nearly equally split between property offenders
(29%) and public-order offenders (31%).



The most frequent offense among probationers was driving while
intoxicated (17%).  Four other offenses -- including
larceny/theft (10%), drug possession (10%), drug trafficking
(10%), and assault (9%) -- accounted for an additional 39% of
the adult probation population.



************************************************

Felons more than half of all adults on probation 

************************************************



Of the 2.6 million adults formally sentenced to probation in
1995, an estimated 1.5 million had been convicted of a felony
(58%).  Of these, half had been convicted of a violent (20%) or
drug offense (31%).  Drug trafficking was the single most
frequent offense among felons on probation (15%).  This was
closely followed by drug possession (13%), larceny/theft (11%),
and burglary (10%).



In contrast, 60% of the estimated 1 million misdemeanants on
probation had been convicted of a public-order offense --35% for
driving while intoxicated, 10% for another traffic offense, and
5% for drunkenness or morals offenses.  An estimated 14% of
probationers convicted of a misdemeanor had committed a violent
offense (nearly all of whom were convicted of assault); 18% a
property offense; and 8% a drug offense.



***************************************************

Women and non-Hispanic whites make up comparatively 
high percentages of adult probationers

*************************************************** 


In 1995 women constituted 21% of the probation population, or
twice as large a share as among the jail and parole populations
(10% each), and more than 3 times the share of women in prison
(6%) (table 2).

Non-Hispanic whites accounted for a larger share of
misdemeanants than felons (62% compared to 55%).  Non-Hispanic
blacks constituted 28% of all probationers (31% of felons and
25% of misdemeanants).  Hispanics, who may be of any race,
comprised 11% of both felons and misdemeanants.



Slightly more than half of all probationers never married (51%),
and 58% had completed at least high school or a GED.  Felons
(54%) were somewhat less likely than misdemeanants (63%) to have
completed high school or a GED.

Men were more likely than women to be sentenced for a violent
offense (19% compared to 10%), but nearly  as likely to have
been sentenced for a drug offense (22% of men and 20% of women)
(table 3).

Among men, driving while intoxicated was the single
most frequent offense (17%), followed by assault (10%), drug
possession (10%), and drug trafficking (10%).  Women most
frequently were sentenced to probation for property offenses
(43%), particularly fraud (21%) and larceny/theft (17%). 
Fourteen percent of women on probation were convicted of driving
while intoxicated, only slightly below the percentage for men. 



Among non-Hispanic probationers, blacks (31%) were nearly twice
as likely as whites (17%) to be under supervision for a drug
offense.  Among Hispanic probationers nearly a quarter had been
convicted of a drug offense.  White (21%) and Hispanic (17%)
probationers were also more than twice as likely as black
probationers (8%) to be under supervision for DWI.  Nearly equal
percentages of whites and blacks were on probation for violent
and property offenses.



*******************************************

DWI accounts for more than a 
quarter of probationers over age 44

*******************************************

Convictions for driving while intoxicated bore a strong
relationship to age, increasing steadily from 7% of those under
age 25, to 28% of those age 45 or older.  DWI was the single
most frequent offense among probationers in each age group 25 or
older.  Among those under age 25, larceny/ theft (14%), drug
trafficking (10%), and burglary (10%) were the most common
offenses.



The relative frequency of other types of offenses also varied by
age. Sexual assault increased from 2% of those under age 25 to
9% of those age 45  or older.  Drug trafficking steadily
declined with advancing age, from 10% of probationers under age
25 to 5% of those 45 or older.

probation.


Felons (32%) were more likely than misdemeanants (27%) to have a
prior criminal history which included incarceration.  The
percentage of felons having a juvenile record of incarceration
was more than double that of misdemeanants (5% to 2%).

Nearly half of all drug offenders had a prior sentence.  Among
all probationers violent offenders had the lowest percentage
(37%) with a prior sentence to probation, and public-order
offenders, the highest  (45%).  Led by those with minor traffic
violations, public-order offenders also had the highest
percentage of persons with a prior sentence to prison or jail
(34%).



Sexual assault offenders (36%) were the least likely to have had
a prior sentence of any type.  The most likely to have had a
prior sentence were probationers convicted of minor traffic
offenses (67%), ahead of those convicted of driving while
intoxicated (51%).



****************************************

Presentence investigations focus 
on the most serious offenders

****************************************


A large portion of probation officers' work is assisting the
courts by preparing presentence investigation reports (PSI's). 
PSI's involve examining records that document the offense and
the defendant's criminal history.  Other information often comes
from consulting with the arresting officer and others who have
had contact with the defendant.


Among adults on probation, PSI's were completed more often for
felons (64%)  than misdemeanants (19%) (table 6).

Probationers whose most serious offense was a public-order offense

Among those probationers for whom a PSI was prepared, 80% had
received a recommendation for probation.  Although this
percentage is evidence that courts accept the PSI findings, this
survey does not contain data on persons sentenced to jail or
prison.  Those data are needed to accurately measure the extent
to which courts follow PSI recommendations. 



Among probationers with a completed PSI, felons were less likely
than misdemeanants to have received a recommendation of
probation (78% compared with 87%).  In addition, a lower
percentage of those with a prior sentence to probation or
incarceration were recommended for probation (75%) than were
those without a prior sentence (84%).

Felons were more likely to have received a split sentence (54%)
than misdemeanants (45%).  An estimated 1 in 5 felons on
probation had received a sentence to prison on the current
sentence.  (Information on average length of sentence to
probation is discussed in the Methodology).

Repeat offenders more likely

*****************************



Among adults on probation, having a criminal record meant a
greater chance of being sentenced to incarceration -- 60% with a
prior sentence received a current sentence to incarceration
compared to 41% without any prior sentence.  Among those
probationers whose prior sentence specifically included jail or
prison, more than two-thirds were again sentenced to
incarceration.  A sentence to probation only, or "straight
probation," was the most likely outcome (59%) for those
probationers with no prior sentences.

While half of the probationers received a sentence that included
a period of incarceration, 36% had actually served time in jail
or prison.  The remainder had their sentence to incarceration
suspended.  An estimated 35% of felons, compared to 25% of
misdemeanants, had served time in a local jail; 9% of felons had
served time in a prison.

Majority pay supervision fees

*****************************



A monetary requirement was the most common condition (84%) --
61% were required to pay supervision fees; 56% to pay a fine;
and 55% to pay court costs.  In addition, nearly a third were
required to pay restitution to the victim or victims of the
crime.  One in ten probationers were restricted from contacting
the victim or victims.



One of every four probationers were required to perform some
type of community service.  Two of every five probationers were
formally required to maintain employment or to enroll in some
type of educational or training program.



The sentences of 10% of all probationers included one or more
requirements intended to monitor or in some way restrict their
movement.  These probationers may have been required to stay
away from certain places like bars or particular businesses or
may have been under electronic monitoring, house arrest, or a
curfew.



Felons and misdemeanants were equally likely to be required to
pay a fee, fine, or court costs.  However, felons were much more
likely than misdemeanants to be required to pay victim
restitution (40% compared to 18%); to have special restrictions
on their movement (13% compared to 6%); and to be required to
maintain employment (41% compared to 27%).



***********************************************

More than 2 of 5 adults on probation required 
to receive treatment for alcohol or drug abuse

***********************************************



More than 2 of every 5 probationers were required to enroll in
some form of substance abuse treatment.  An estimated 29% of
probationers were required to get treatment for alcohol abuse or
dependency and 23% for drug abuse.  Alcohol treatment was
required about twice as frequently among misdemeanants as felons
(41% compared to 21%), while drug treatment was required nearly
twice as frequently among felons as among misdemeanants (28%
compared to 15%).



Nearly a third of all probationers were subject to mandatory
drug testing -- 43% of felons and 17% of misdemeanants.



Nearly 1 in 5 probationers were required to participate in other
treatment programs, such as special psychiatric/ psychological
counseling, sex offenders program, or "other counseling" --
primarily counseling for domestic violence.

An estimated 72% of all probationers had some type of contact

------------------------------------------------------------------------


Most personal contacts occurred in the probation office (59%); 
fewer in the field, at an offender's home or job, (12%).



In addition to face-to-face contacts and contacts by telephone
or by mail, probation agencies made "collateral" contacts with
other persons, such as the probationer's employers, teachers,
treatment providers, police, relatives or acquaintances to
gather information on those under their supervision.  Overall,
during the 30 days before the survey, probation agencies made
one or more collateral contacts for more than a quarter of all
probationers.



Felons were more likely than misdemeanants to have had an office
contact in the last 30 days (63% as compared with 53%), to have
had a field contact (15% compared with 7%), and  to have one or
more collateral contacts (31% compared to 22%).



Based on probation office classifications, nearly half of all
felons and a third of all misdemeanants were currently
supervised at a "medium" or "high" level.  Though agencies
differed in how they defined levels of supervision, a greater
number of personal contacts within 30 days of the survey
characterized both medium and high levels (table 10).

-------------------------------------------------------------------




The most common program was alcohol or drug treatment/counseling 
-- 33% of felons and 42% of misdemeanants had received such 
treatment while under their current sentence to probation.  



Nearly a third of probationers had been tested for drugs at
least once since entering probation.  Drug testing was more
common among felons (44%) than misdemeanants (17%).



Felons were more likely than misdemeanants to have participated
in an intensive supervision program (15% compared to 4%).  Ten
percent of felons also received psychological or psychiatric
counseling, as compared with 6% of misdemeanants. 



Not all of the probationers who had participated in the special
supervision or treatment programs were doing so at the time of
the survey.  When survey was conducted, an estimated 37% were
enrolled in a treatment program, being tested for drugs, under
intensive supervision, or in another type of program.  A quarter
of all probationers were being tested for drugs; a sixth were in
an alcohol or drug treatment program.  Fewer than 5% were under

18% faced a disciplinary hearing 
after entering probation

****************************************



Probationers who violate a condition of their probation, or who
are arrested for a new offense, may be called before the court
to review the circumstances of their violation.  Such
disciplinary hearings may result in the issuance of an arrest
warrant for a probationer who has absconded, a sentence to
incarceration, or reinstatement of probation with or without new
conditions. 



At the time of the survey, an estimated 18% of all adults on
probation had one or more formal disciplinary hearings after
entering probation supervision.  Probationers included in the
survey who had served longer on a probation sentence also had
more experience with disciplinary hearings.  Of those who had
served 36 months or more and who were still on probation (or who
had returned to probation following a period of incarceration),
38% had at least one formal hearing, compared with 5% of those
who had served less than 6 months.

*Excludes 67,508 probationers (3% of all adults  on probation)
for whom information on formal disciplinary hearings or time
served on probation was not available.



The records check survey underestimates the percentage of all
persons sentenced to probation who have disciplinary hearings
over the course of their sentence.  Probationers who had a
disciplinary hearing which resulted in revocation of their
probation and who were currently incarcerated were excluded from
the survey.  In addition, some probationers who had no
disciplinary hearing may have had a hearing after the survey but
before completing their sentence.  Consequently, the percentage
of all persons initially placed on probation and subsequently
having a disciplinary hearing is likely to have been higher than
18%.



The records-check survey underestimates the percentage of
probationers who have disciplinary hearings.  Some probationers
who might have participated in the survey were returned to
incarceration before the survey; others who did participate and
who had no disciplinary hearing subsequently violated the
conditions of their supervision. Therefore, the percentage of
all persons initially placed on probation and appearing at a
disciplinary hearing is likely to be higher than 18%.

****************************************



Among probationers included in the survey, those who were
unemployed were more likely to have had a disciplinary hearing
(23%) than those who were employed (16%).  Probationers who had
a prior sentence to probation or incarceration were also more
likely to have had a hearing than probationers with no prior
sentence (23% compared to 15%).

Failure to maintain contact the most 
frequent reason for hearing

****************************************



Of those probationers who had experienced a disciplinary 
hearing, the most frequent reason was absconding or failure 
to contact the probation officer (41%) (table 12).

----------------------------------------------------------------------


This was followed by arrest or conviction for a new offense 
(38%), failure to pay fines or restitution (38%), and failure 
to attend or complete an alcohol or drug treatment program 
(22%).  An estimated 11% of probationers had a hearing because 
of a positive drug test; 8% had failed to complete a community 
service requirement.



Overall, 43% of felons and 38% of misdemeanants with at least
one disciplinary hearing failed to maintain contact with a
probation officer.  Arrest or conviction for a new offense was
somewhat more likely among felons  than misdemeanants (43%
compared to 31%).  Failure to attend or complete a substance
abuse treatment program, however, was more frequent among
misdemeanants (33%) than felons (18%).  Forty-three of
misdemeanants and 34% of felons with a disciplinary hearing
failed to pay fines or restitution.

**********************************



Among persons under probation supervision who had experienced
one or more disciplinary hearings, 42% were permitted to
continue their sentence, but only with the imposition of
additional conditions; 29% were incarcerated in jail or prison;
and 29% had their supervision reinstated without any new
conditions (table 13).

---------------------------------------------------------------------


Nearly 1 in 4 probationers had not completed a hearing. Four 
percent had charges that were not sustained.* 



**Note**The percentages for hearing outcomes add to a total
larger than 100% because some probationers reported more than
one hearing or outcome. ****



Among probationers who had a disciplinary hearing, felons were
more likely than misdemeanants to have been incarcerated (34%
compared to 19%) or to have had their supervision reinstated
with new conditions (46% compared to 34%).

Methodology

************



The 1995 Survey of Adults on Probation (SAP) was conducted for
the  Bureau of Justice Statistics by the U.S. Bureau of the
Census.  It was the first nationally representative survey to
collect information on the individual characteristics of adult
probationers.



The SAP was a two-part survey, consisting of a records check
based on the probationers' administrative records and a personal
interview.  Only information from the records check
componen--collected during December 1994 through September
1995--are included in this report.

The sample for the 1995 SAP records check sample was selected
from a universe of 2,627 State, county, and municipal probation
agencies with a total of 2,618,132 formally sentenced
probationers (appendix table 1).

Note: The universe file for the 1995 Survey of Adults on Probation was 
based on the 1991 Census of Probation and Parole Agencies.  In this census 
agencies reported the address of their field offices and the number of adults 
under supervision in each office.  Field offices were categorized based on the 
characteristics of their agencies by type (executive or judicial branch) and 
level of government (State or local). 
/aOf 165 offices selected, 19 were out of scope, not currently supervising 
adult probationers, and 19 would not participate.  Twenty-four selected field 
offices reported having additional suboffices.  Of the 110 suboffices, 40 were 
sampled.  One office represented an entire State (Massachusetts), from which 
a systematic sample of 210 probationers were selected.
/bOf 5,922 eligible probationers selected within 167 offices/sites, completed 
record check forms were received for 5,867 (or 99.1%).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The universe came from the 1991 Census of Probation and Parole 
Agencies.  The sample design was a stratified two-stage selection.



In the first stage, probation agencies were stratified into 16
strata defined by government branch (executive or judicial) and
level (State or local), and census region (Northeast, Midwest,
South, or West).  The largest 43 probation agencies were made
self-representing and were selected into the sample with
certainty.  The remaining 2,584 non-selfrepresenting probation
agencies were grouped within strata into 122 roughly equal size
clusters.  One agency was selected from each of the 122
clusters, with probability of selection proportional to size.



Twenty-four agencies had a total of 110 additional subagencies
that were not included among the 2,627 probation agencies.  A
total of 41 subagencies were selected, and were included in the
cluster of their parent agency, resulting in an overall total of
206 agencies.  Excluding 19 agencies subsequently determined to
be out of scope and 20 which refused to participate resulted in
a final total of 167 agencies selected.



In the second stage, Bureau of the Census field representatives
visited each selected agency and systematically selected a
sample of probationers using predetermined procedures.  Only
persons age 18 and older, who were formally sentenced to
probation, who were not absconders were included in the records
check.  Excluded were persons supervised by a Federal probation
agency, those only on parole,  persons on presentence or
pretrial diversion, and juveniles.  As a result, approximately 1
of every 442 probationers were selected.  A total of 5,867
records checks were completed by a probation officer or other
probation agency representative.  The overall response rate of
87.4% represents the combination of an agency response rate of
88.3% and a records check completion rate of 99.1%.



Based on the completed records checks, estimates for the entire
population were generated using weighting factors derived from
the original probability of selection in the sample.  These
factors were adjusted for variable rates of non-response across
strata.  A further adjustment was made to the 1994 yearend
counts of the number of adults formally sentenced to probation.



*************************

Accuracy of the estimates

*************************



The accuracy of the estimates presented in this report depends
on two types of error: sampling and nonsampling.  Sampling error
is the variation that may occur by chance because a sample
rather than a complete enumeration of the population was
conducted.  Nonsampling error can be attributed to many sources
such as the inability to obtain information about all cases in
the sample, inability to obtain complete and correct information
from the administrative records, and processing errors.  In any
survey the full extent of the nonsampling error is never known.  



The sampling error, as measured by an estimated standard error,
varies by the size of the estimate and the size of the base
population.  Estimates of the standard errors have been
calculated for the 1995 survey (appendix table 2).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

These estimates may be used to construct confidence intervals 
around percentages in this report.  For example, the 95-percent
confidence interval around the percent of adults on probation
for a drug offense is approximately 21.4% plus or minus 1.96
times 1.1% (or 19.2% to 23.6%).



These standard errors may also be used to test the significance
of the difference between two sample statistics by pooling the
standard errors of the two sample estimates.  For example, the
standard error of the difference between white and black adults
on probation for drug offenses would be 2.8% (or the square root
of the sum of the squared standard errors for each group).  The
95-percent confidence interval around the difference would be
1.96 times 2.8% (or 5.5%).  Since the difference of 13.9% (30.9%
minus 17.0%) is greater than 5.5%, the difference would be
considered statistically significant.



The standard errors reported should be used only for tests on
all probationers.  Comparisons of male and female probationers
require different standard errors.

Data on prior sentences 

************************



The availability of criminal history data in probation office
administrative records was more limited than other types of
information collected on the SAP records check form.  Complete
information on whether a probationer had a prior sentence to
probation or incarceration, and whether any prior sentences were
as a juvenile or as an adult, was available for 74% of the
estimated 2,620,560 adult probationers covered by the survey. 
Partial information was available for 15% of probationers.  No
data were available for the remaining 12%.

This is higher than the 12% of probationers for whom no information 
was available because partial data could only be used when they 
indicated a prior sentence.  Partial data did not allow the existence 
of a prior sentence to be ruled out.



The amount of missing criminal history data varied for each type
of prior sentence status.  Differing percentages of missing data
occurred for the status of having or not having a prior
sentence.  Twenty percent of records were missing information on
prior sentence to incarceration, compared to 14% of records missing 
data on prior sentence to probation. Twenty-five percent of all 
records were missing whether a probationer had a prior juvenile 
sentence, and 19% were missing whether there was a prior adult sentence.



The amount of missing data also varied by severity of offense,
with misdemeanants registering twice as much missing data as
felons for any type of prior sentences (25% compared with 11%). 
Large differences between misdemeanants and felons were found
for each type or prior sentence.  Data were missing for more
than a third of misdemeanants regarding a prior juvenile
sentence -- nearly 20% greater than for the prior sentence
status of juvenile felons (16%).



More information on prior sentences was available for
probationers with a completed PSI (8% missing data compared with
22% missing data).  Not having a PSI completed was strongly
related to having more missing data for each type of prior
sentence.  Nearly a third of the data on prior juvenile
sentences was missing for probationers without a completed PSI.



Less highly supervised probationers were more likely to have
incomplete prior sentence information available than were those
on higher levels of supervision -- 41% of data were missing for
unclassified probationers, 16% for those on minimum or
administrative supervision, and 12% for those on a high or
medium level. The amount of missing data by level of supervision
varied for each type of prior sentence.  Data on prior juvenile
sentence status were missing for about half of probationers
whose level of supervision was unclassified.

Because of the SAP sampling
design, this is longer than the average sentence to probation of
felons in State courts in 1994 (40 months), as estimated by BJS'
National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP).  Persons who entered
probation with shorter sentences left probation more quickly,
resulting in a longer average sentence length among persons
remaining to be sampled for the SAP.



Among sampled felons admitted to probation within the 12 months
prior to the SAP, the average probation sentence was 42 months,
or about the same as the NJRP estimate of average sentence
imposed in 1994.  Few felons sentenced in the last year left
probation supervision prior to the survey date.



Overall, probationers included in the SAP had received an
average sentence to probation of 39 months.  The average
sentence among misdemeanants (21 months) was 2 1/2 years shorter
than that for felons.
