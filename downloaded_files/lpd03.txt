employing 44% of all officers, maintained or 
created a written community policing plan 
during the 12-month period ending June 30, 
2003.

* Forty-three percent of departments, employing 
74% of all officers, used full-time school 
resource officers in 2003. Collectively, these 
agencies employed about 14,300 such officers.

Policies and procedures

* Nearly all departments had a written policy on 
pursuit driving. Three-fifths restricted vehicle

1990.

* Nationwide, local police departments in 2003
operated an estimated 242,700 cars, or about 
1 car for every 2 officers employed. About a 
third of these cars were unmarked. 

* Nearly 1 in 3 departments used dogs for law

The LEMAS survey

During 2003 the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
(BJS), as part of its Law Enforcement 
Management and Administrative Statistics(LEMAS) 
program, surveyed a nationally representative 
sample of State and local law enforcement 
agencies operating nationwide. Previous LEMAS 
surveys were conducted in 1987, 1990, 1993,
1997, 1999 (limited scope), and 2000.

This report presents data from the 2003 survey
describing the nearly 13,000 local police 
departments operating in the United States 
in terms of their personnel, expenditures and 
pay, operations, community policing 
initiatives, written policies and procedures, 
computers and information systems, and
equipment. Comparisons are made with prior 
years where appropriate.

The LEMAS survey sample is selected from a 
periodic census of all State and local law 
enforcement agencies operating in the United 
States. According to the most recent census, 
conducted in 2000, nearly all local police 
departments are operated by municipal (85%) 
or township (13%) governments. A total of 171
local police departments were operated by 
tribal governments, and 52 by county 
governments.

The 2003 LEMAS survey questionnaire was mailed 
to 3,154 State and local law enforcement agencies,
including 955 agencies with 100 or more sworn
officers (see Methodology for a description of 
the sample). The overall response rate was 91%. 

This report and its companion report, Sheriffs' 
Offices 2003, summarize data collected from 
agencies of all sizes. Agency level data for 
agencies with 100 or more officers are published 
in Law Enforcement Management and Administrative 
Statistics, 2003.

Personnel

As of June 30, 2003 local police departments 
had an estimated 580,749 full-time employees. 
Approximately 452,000, or 78%, of full-time 
local police employees were sworn personnel 
(those with general arrest powers). Local 
police departments also employed about 51,000 
persons on a part-time basis.  About half
of the part-time employees were sworn 
officers.

Local police departments employed 67% of 
full-time sworn officers working for State 
and local general purpose law enforcement 
agencies nationwide. Their 129,013 full-time 
civilian employees comprised 42% of nonsworn 
State and local law enforcement employees.

From 1987 (the first year of the LEMAS survey) 
to 2003, local police employment increased by 
about 135,000, or 27% -- an average of 1.7% 
annually. The number of full-time sworn officers 
increased by about 96,400, or 30%, during this 
period.

There were about 14,800 more full-time local 
police employees in 2003 than in 2000, an 
increase of 2.6%, or just under 1% annually. 
When only sworn personnel are considered, 
employment by local police departments 
increased by about 10,800, or 2.5%, from 
2000 to 2003. 

From 1987 to 2003 the number of full-time 
civilian local police employees increased 
from 90,622 to 129,013, or 42%. This included 
an increase of about 4,000, or 3.2%, from 
2000 to 2003.

Nationwide, 594, or 4.7%, of local police 
departments employed at least 100 sworn 
personnel. This included 50 departments with 
1,000 or more officers. The New York City 
Police department was the largest, with about 
36,000 officers (see Exhibit 1). An estimated
5,757, or 45.5%, of departments employed fewer 
than 10 officers, including 561 with just 1 
officer.
                                
Thirty-four percent of all full-time local 
police officers were employed by a department 
with 1,000 or more sworn personnel, and 61% 
were employed by a department with at least 
100 sworn personnel. Departments that employed 
fewer than 10 officers accounted for about 5% 
of officers nationwide.

Although 74% of all local police departments 
served fewer than 10,000 residents, these 
agencies employed just 14% of all officers. 
About half of all officers served a 
jurisdiction with 100,000 or more residents. 
While departments serving the largest cities
had thousands of officers on average, those 
serving fewer than 2,500 residents had an 
average of just 4 full-time employees, 
including 3 sworn officers.

Overall, about half of part-time local police 
employees were sworn officers. The average 
number of part-time sworn employees was no 
higher than three in any population category.

Among municipal police departments, the average
ratio of full-time officers per 1,000 residents 
was 2.5. Those serving 25,000 to 99,999 
residents had the lowest average ratio(1.8).  

Overall, 68% of full-time local police officers 
had regularly assigned duties that included 
responding to calls for service. The proportion 
of officers responding to calls ranged from 
about 6 in 10 among departments serving 100,000 
or more residents, to about 9 in 10 in those 
serving fewer than 10,000 residents.

As of June 30, 2003, local police departments
collectively employed 96% of the maximum number 
of full-time sworn personnel authorized by 
their budgets. The lowest actual-to-authorized 
ratio for sworn personnel was among departments 
serving fewer than 2,500 residents (92%).

Officer separations and new hires

Sixty-one percent of local police departments
experienced officer separations during the 
12-month period ending June 30, 2003. Nearly 
all departments serving a population of 50,000 
or more had officer separations during the 12-
month period, compared to less than half of 
those serving a population under 2,500.

The average number of separations across all
agencies was 4 officers, ranging from 2 
officers among departments serving fewer than 
10,000 residents to 284 officers among 
departments serving 1 million or more residents.

During the same time period, 60% of departments
hired new officers. The average number of new 
hires across all agencies was 5 officers, 
ranging from 2 among departments serving fewer 
than 10,000 residents to 359 among departments 
serving 1 million or more residents.

Overall, an estimated 32,122 full-time sworn 
officers separated from local police 
departments during the 12-month period ending 
June 30, 2003. About half (16,131 officers) of 
these separations were due to resignations, 29% 
(9,397 officers) were due to nonmedical 
retirements, 8% (2,606 officers) were dismissals, 
6% (1,807 officers) were medical/disability
retirements, and 4% (1,305 officers) were
probationary rejections. 

About three-quarters of the separations in
departments serving the smallest jurisdictions 
were due to resignations, compared to about a 
sixth in the largest jurisdictions. In contrast, 
three-quarters of all separations in the largest 
jurisdictions were due to nonmedical retirements, 
compared to just 4% in the smallest.

Overall, local police departments hired an 
estimated 34,474 new full-time sworn officers 
during the 12-month period ending June 30, 2003. 
The total included 28,791 entry-level hires (84%), 
5,323 lateral transfers (15%), and 360 other new 
hires (1%).

Almost all new hires among departments serving
500,000 or more residents, and more than 8 in 
10 new hires among departments serving 10,000 
to 499,999 residents, were entry-level hires. 

Lateral transfers were more common among smaller
departments, comprising about 30% of all new hires
by departments serving less than 10,000 residents,
compared with 1% of new hires in the largest
departments. 

Ten percent of agencies experienced separations 
only during the 12-month period. These agencies 
had an estimated 2,786 separations. Nine percent 
of agencies experienced new hires only. These 
agencies had an estimated 2,027 new hires.

Net personnel change, 2002-2003

The 34,474 new hires by local police departments
during the year ending June 30, 2003 and the 
32,122 separations over the same period 
represents an overall estimated net increase in 
the number of full-time local police officers 
of 2,352.

Overall, agencies serving fewer than 2,500 
residents experienced a net loss of 163 officers, 
the largest decrease of any population category. 

The 2,500 to 9,999 population category (-21), 
was the only other one to record a net loss 
during this period.

The largest increase in number of officers was in 
the largest jurisdictions where 856 more officers 
were serving populations of 1 million or more in 
June 2003 compared to a year earlier. The next 
largest increase was in jurisdictions with 10,000 
to 24,999 residents, where 526 officers were added.

Military reservists called to active duty

During the 12-month period ending June 30, 2003,
21% of local police departments had full-time 
sworn personnel who were called up as full-time 
military reservists and were, therefore, no 
longer available for law enforcement duties. The 
percent of departments with call-ups ranged from 
94% or more in population categories of 100,000 
or more to 6% in jurisdictions with fewer than 
2,500 residents.

Overall, about 7,500 officers were called-up for
reserve military service. About three-fifths (59%)
of them came from departments serving 50,000 or 
more residents. The average number of officers 
called up was 3, ranging from 1 officer among 
departments serving fewer than 25,000 residents to 
74 officers among departments serving a population 
of 1 million or more. 

Reserve or auxiliary officers

Some local police departments partly offset officer
shortages through the use of supplemental personnel,
such as sworn reserve or auxiliary officers.  
As of June 30, 2003, 35% of departments were using
part-time sworn reserve or auxiliary officers, 
with an average of 6 officers each. Overall, 
local police departments employed 26,625 such 
officers. Seven percent of departments were 
using full-time sworn reserve or auxiliary 
officers, with a total of 5,376 nationwide.

Eleven percent of departments were using 
part-time nonsworn reserve or auxiliary 
officers, with a total of nearly 14,000 used 
nationwide. One percent of departments were 
using full-time nonsworn reserve or auxiliary 
officers, with an overall total of about 600.

Gender and race of officers

Of the 451,737 full-time sworn personnel in 
local police departments as of June 2003, 
approximately 11% were women. The percentage 
of female officers ranged from about 17% in 
departments serving 1 million or more 
residents to about 6% in those serving fewer 
than 10,000 residents. 

In 2003 the estimated 51,046 female officers
represented an increase of about 4,400, or 9%, 
from 2000. During this time, female 
representation among local police officers 
increased from 10.6% to 11.3%. By comparison, 
women comprised just 7.6% of local police 
officers in 1987.

In 2003 an estimated 23.6% of full-time local 
police officers were members of a racial or 
ethnic minority. Minority officers comprised 
more than a third of the total in jurisdictions 
with 250,000 or more residents.

Blacks or African Americans accounted for 11.7% 
of all local police officers in 2003. Black 
employment was highest among departments 
serving a population of 500,000 to 999,999 
(24.4%).

An estimated 9.1% of local police officers 
nationwide were Hispanic or Latino, with the 
highest representation among departments 
serving a population of 1 million or more 
(19.3%).

The number of local police officers who were
members of a racial or ethnic minority in 2003
(106,610) represented an increase of about 
7,000, or 7%, over 2000 levels. From 2000 to 
2003 minority representation increased slightly, 
from 22.6% to 23.6%. In 1987 minorities comprised 
14.6% of all local police officers. 

The estimated 52,853 full-time black or African
American local police officers employed in 2003 
was an increase of about 1,500, or 3%, compared 
to 2000. During this time the percent of officers 
who were black remained unchanged at 11.7%. In 
1987 blacks comprised 9.3% of officers.

An estimated 41,108 Hispanic or Latino officers 
were employed by local police departments in 
2003. This was about 4,700, or 13%, more than in 
2000. From 2000 to 2003 the percentage of local 
police officers who were Hispanic or Latino rose 
from 8.3% to 9.1%. In 1987, 4.5% of officers were 
Hispanic. 

From 2000 to 2003 representation by other minority
groups such as Asians, Pacific Islanders, and
American Indians increased by about 850, or 7%, 
to about 12,650 officers. These groups comprised 
2.8% of local police officers in 2003 compared to 
2.7% in 2000, and 0.8% in 1987.

Screening of officer applicants 

Local police departments employed a variety of
screening methods when hiring new officers. Nearly
all used personal interviews (98%), and a majority
used medical exams (85%), drug tests (73%), and
psychological evaluations (67%).

Among departments serving 50,000 or more residents, 
more than 8 in 10 used physical agility tests
and written aptitude tests. More than half the
departments in these population categories used
polygraph exams.

In addition to interviews, tests, and examinations,
nearly all departments screened recruits through
criminal record checks (99%), background
investigations (98%), and driving record checks
(96%). A majority conducted credit record checks
(55%), including more than 8 in 10 departments
serving 25,000 or more residents.

Nearly all local police officers were employed by
departments that used criminal record checks,
background investigations, driving record checks,
medical exams, and personal interviews. About 9 in
10 were employed by departments that used
psychological evaluations and drug tests. More than
two-thirds of officers worked in departments using
physical agility tests (80% of officers), aptitude 
tests (74%), and credit checks (70%).

Education and training requirements

Nearly all (98%) local police departments had an
education requirement for new officer recruits.
Eighteen percent of departments had some type of
college requirement, with 9% requiring a 2-year
degree.

In 2003 the percentage of officers employed by a
department with some type of college requirement 
for new officers (33%) was about the same as 
in 2000 (32%), but more than 3 times as high 
as in 1990 (10%).  

In the largest jurisdictions new local police 
recruits were required to complete an average 
of about 1,500 hours of training compared to 
about 800 hours in the smallest. On average, 
about three-quarters of training hours were 
State mandated, with the remainder an agency 
requirement. For greater detail on basic law
enforcement training, see State and Local Law
Enforcement Training Academies, 2002.

From 2000 to 2003 there were significant 
increases in training requirements for local 
police recruits in jurisdictions with fewer 
than 250,000 residents. In jurisdictions with 
50,000 to 249,999 residents, the average 
combined field and academy training
requirement rose from 1,178 hours to 1,355 
hours; with 10,000 to 49,999 residents, from 
969 to 1,148; and with fewer than 10,000

1,514 to 1,543.  

The average annual inservice training 
requirement for non-probationary officers was 
47 hours, including 24 State-mandated hours.

Overall, just 3% of departments operated a training
academy; however, nearly all of those serving a
population of 250,000 or more did so. Nationwide,
45% of all officers were employed by a department
that operated an academy.

Budget and pay

Operating budgets

The total operating budget of local police 
departments during fiscal 2003 was about $43.3 
billion. This was 10% more than in 2000 after 
adjusting for inflation. (These figures do not 
include budgets for capital expenditures such 
as equipment purchases or construction projects.) 
Local police departments accounted for 59% of 
the $73.6 billion in total operating budgets 
for general purpose State and local law 
enforcement agencies. 

Nationwide, operating budgets were about $3.4 
million per department for fiscal 2003, ranging 
from about $572 million for departments serving 
a population of 1 million or more, to $208,000 
among those serving fewer than 2,500 residents. 

The overall operating cost per resident was $200, 
with departments in jurisdictions with a population 
of 1 million or more costing the most to operate, 
$282 per resident. Departments serving a 
population of less than 10,000 had the lowest 
per resident cost -- about $160. 

Nationwide, local police departments cost an
estimated $93,300 per sworn officer to operate 
for fiscal 2003. Costs ranged from $99,000 or 
more per officer in population categories of 
25,000 or more, to $45,500 per officer in 
jurisdictions with a population under 2,500.

When both sworn and nonsworn employees are
included, the average operating budget for local 
police departments was about $71,500 per employee 
for the year. Operating costs ranged from more 
than $75,000 per employee in jurisdictions with 
50,000 or more residents to $40,000 per employee 
in those with fewer than 2,500 residents.

factored in, it is estimated that new entry-level 
local police officers started at an average 
salary of about $35,500 during 2003. This was 
12% more than in 2000; a 5% increase after 
adjusting for inflation.

Community policing

Community policing promotes and supports
organizational strategies to address the causes and
reduce the fear of crime and social disorder through
problem-solving tactics and police-community
partnerships. Balancing responses to calls for service
with proactive problem solving, effective community
policing requires police and citizens to join 
together in identifying and addressing underlying 
causes of crime and disorder. The implementation of 
a community policing plan is designed to support and 
empower front-line officers, decentralize command, 
and encourage innovative problem solving. For more
information see the COPS office website at
<http://www.cops. Usdoj.gov>.

In 2003, 14% of local police departments, employing
44% of all local police officers, had a formally 
written community policing plan. This included at 
least 40% of the departments in each population 
category of 50,000 or more.    

Among the two-thirds of local police departments 
that had an agency mission statement in 2003, 70%,
representing 47% of all departments, had one that
included some aspect of community policing. These
departments employed 73% of all local police 
officers.

Community policing training

those serving 100,000 or more residents to about 
a sixth among those serving fewer than 2,500 
residents.

Forty-eight percent of departments, employing 
57% of officers, trained at least some inservice 
officers during the 1-year period. Seventeen 
percent of departments, employing 19% of all 
officers, trained all inservice officers in 
community policing.

Twelve percent of departments, employing 28% of
nonsworn local police employees, trained at least
some civilian employees in community policing 
during the 1-year period.

Community policing personnel

Overall, 58% of departments, employing 82% of all
officers, had full-time sworn personnel serving as
community policing officers. In some jurisdictions
these officers are known as community relations
officers, community resource officers, or some other
name indicative of the community policing approach
they employ. Nationwide, local police departments
employed about 55,000 community policing officers or
their equivalent. 

A majority of departments in all population categories
had full-time community policing officers. Those
serving a population of 1 million or more employed
287 such officers on average. Departments serving
fewer than 2,500 residents had 3 on average.
In all population categories the percentage of local
police departments using community policing officers
in 2003 was greater than in 1997, but less than in
2000. In jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000 
residents, the percentage rose from 26% in 1997 to 
62% in 2000, then dropped to 54% in 2003; in those 
with 10,000 to 49,999 residents, from 57%, to 75%, to
67%; in those with 50,000 to 249,999 residents, from

10,000 or more used school resource officers, 
including 93% of those in jurisdictions with 
250,000 to 499,999 residents. 

School resource officers use a community policing
approach to provide a safe environment for students
and staff. In addition to handling calls for service
within the school, they work closely with school
administrators and staff to prevent crime and disorder
by monitoring crime trends, problem areas, cultural
conflicts, and other areas of concern.  

As of June 2003 local police departments had an
estimated 14,337 full-time sworn personnel assigned
as school resource officers, about 600 more than in

officers in 2003 ranged from 75 in departments
serving 1 million or more residents, to 2 in those
serving fewer than 25,000 residents.

all officers, partnered with citizen groups to 
elicit feedback for developing community policing
strategies. This included more than two-thirds of
departments serving a population of 25,000 or more.

department that had partnerships or agreements with
other law enforcement agencies (63%), school groups
(62%), neighborhood associations (62%), or local
public agencies (57%).

About half of all officers worked for a department 
that had problem-solving partnerships or written
agreements with business groups (49%), advocacy
groups (49%), or youth service organizations (49%). 

More than two-fifths of all officers were employed 
by a department that had partnerships or written
agreements with senior citizen groups (45%) or

Methodology

The Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey collects 
data from a nationally representative sample of 
publicly funded State and local law enforcement 
agencies in the United States.  

This report presents data from the 2003 survey
describing local police departments in terms of 
their personnel, expenditures and pay, operations,
community policing initiatives, equipment, computers
and information systems, and written policies.  

The 2003 LEMAS sample design called for the survey
questionnaire to be mailed to 3,179 State and local
law enforcement agencies. Twenty-five agencies were
determined to be out-of-scope for the survey because
they had closed, outsourced their operations, or were
operating on a part-time basis, resulting in a final
mailout total of 3,154 agencies. The initial mailing 
of the questionnaire was conducted in December 2003.
The pay period containing June 30, 2000 was used as
the reference date for all questions, unless 
otherwise noted.  

Allowing for the exclusion of special jurisdiction
agencies and Texas constables, 955 law enforcement
agencies in the United States with 100 or more sworn
officers as of June 30, 2000, were included in the
sample as self-representing (SR) agencies. This
included 574 local police departments, 332 sheriffs'
offices, and the 49 primary State law enforcement
agencies. 

The self-representing (SR) agencies were
supplemented by a nationally representative sample
of agencies with fewer than 100 sworn personnel.
These nonself-representing (NSR) agencies were
chosen using a stratified random sample with cells
based on the type of agency (local police or sheriff),
size of population served, and number of sworn
personnel. The 2,199 NSR agencies selected included
1,539 local police departments and 660 sheriffs'
offices.

A total of 2,859 agencies responded to the LEMAS
questionnaire for a response rate of 90.6%. This
included 904 SR agencies (94.7%) and 1,955 NSR
agencies (88.9%). The final database includes
responses from 1,947 local police departments, 863
sheriffs' offices, and the 49 primary State law
enforcement agencies. The overall response rate for
local police departments was 92.1%, for sheriffs'
offices, 87.0%, and for the State law enforcement
agencies, 100%.

The base weight for all SR agencies is one. For NSR
sheriffs' offices, it is four. For NSR local police
departments, the base weights are determined by
number of sworn personnel employed as reported in
the 2000 BJS Census of State and Local Law
Enforcement Agencies. For agencies with 0 to 6
sworn officers, the base weight is 15.55; for 7 to 
13 officers, 9.65; for 14 to 23 officers, 7.09; for 
24 to 39 officers, 4.95; for 40 to 62 officers, 
3.38; and for 63 to 99 officers, the base weight 
is 2.14.

The final weight associated with every agency, both
SR and NSR, is the product of the base weight, a
factor that adjusted for changes in the universe 
since 2000, and a factor that adjusted for any
nonresponding agencies in each cell.  

The final weight for all SR local police agencies is
1.034234, for SR sheriffs' offices it is 1.106667, and
for the 49 primary State law enforcement agencies, it
is 1. For NSR sheriffs' offices the final weight is
4.847247. For NSR local police departments, the final
weights are as follows: agencies with 0 to 6 sworn
officers, 20.355930; 7 to 13 officers, 10.925000; 14 
to 23 officers, 7.707424; 24 to 39 officers, 5.313808; 
40 to 62 officers, 3.555024; and 63 to 99 officers,
2.216080.

Some responding agencies did not fully complete the
LEMAS questionnaire. When an agency did not
supply a response to an item, hot deck imputation,
median value imputation, or ratio imputation was
used. Hot deck imputation uses the value reported by
a randomly selected agency from the same sample
cell. Median value imputation uses the median value
of an item reported by agencies in the same sample
cell. Ratio imputation uses the median value of a 
ratio reported by agencies in the same sample cell.

Because the data from agencies with fewer than 100
sworn personnel were collected from a sample, the
results are subject to sampling error. The survey 
data are also subject to response and processing 
errors.
