The total Federal, State, and local adult correctional population --
incarcerated or in the community -- grew by 130,700 during 2003 to reach 
a new high of nearly 6.9 million. About 3.2% of the U.S. adult population, 
or 1 in every 32 adults, were incarcerated or on probation or parole at
yearend 2003.

A total of 4,073,987 adult men and women were on probation at yearend 2003,
representing a growth of 1.2% during the year. The adult parole population
grew 3.1%, rising to a total of 774,588 by December 31, 2003. Since 1995 
the parole population has been the slowest growing correctional population,
increasing 1.7% annually, compared to jails (4.0% annually), prisons
(3.4%), and probation (2.9%).

Over 4.8 million adult men and women on probation
or parole

At yearend 2003 the number of adult men and women in the United States who
were being supervised on probation or parole reached a record high 4,848,575,
up from 3,757,282 on December 31, 1995. These data were collected in the 2003
Annual Probation Survey and the 2003 Annual Parole Survey conducted by the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).

In 2003 the number of adults under supervision in the community increased
1.5%, which was less than the average annual increase of 3.2% since 1995.  

The total adult correctional population, including those incarcerated and
those being supervised in the community, reached a new high of 6,889,800 
at the end of 2003. At yearend 2003, 3.2%, or about 1 in every 32 adults 
in the United States, were in State or Federal prisons, local jails, or 
under the supervision of probation or parole authorities, up from 2.7% 
in 1995.  

Texas and California led the Nation in number of
adults supervised in the community

More than 1 million persons being supervised in the community in 2003, or
about 1 in 5 probationers and parolees, were in Texas and California. Texas
led the Nation with 534,260 persons on probation or parole, followed by
California with 485,039.

Washington led the Nation with the largest percentage of its adult population
under community supervision (3.8% at yearend 2003), followed by Texas (3.3%)
and Rhode Island (3.2%). California's community supervision rate of 1.9% was
slightly more than half that of Texas.

Nine States reported that fewer than 1% of their adult populations were on
probation or parole. New Hampshire had the lowest rate of supervision in 
the community (549 offenders per 100,000 adults). 

4 States reported an increase of 10% or more in
their probation population 

In 2003 Kentucky reported an increase of 17% in the number of adults on
probation, followed by Mississippi (up 15%), and Nebraska and New Hampshire
(each up 12%). Twenty-nine States reported an increase in their adult
probation population during 2003. 

Nineteen States had fewer adults on probation at the end of 2003 than at the
beginning of the year, led by Minnesota, down 10%, the only double-digit
decrease during 2003. 

49,920 probationers added in 2003

During 2003 the probation population grew by 49,920, an increase of 1.2%. 

At yearend 2003 the probation supervision rate totaled 1,876 probationers 
per 100,000 adult U.S. residents –- the equivalent of almost 1 in every 53
adults. Washington State with 3,767 probationers per 100,000 adult State
residents had the highest rate of probation supervision; New Hampshire 
(with 426 per 100,000) had the lowest. 

More than 2.2 million adults entered probation supervision during 2003, an
increase of almost 100,600 probation entries from 2002. Since 1995 the 
annual number of entries to probation, however, has fluctuated --increasing
from 1995 to 2000, dropping in 2001, and then increasing again in 2002 and
2003.

--------------------------------------
At yearend 2003, 1 in 5 probationers were women; 1
in 3 were black  

Nationwide, women represented a slightly larger percentage of the probation
population in 2003 than in 1995. Women were 23% of adults on probation in 
2003 (933,100), up from 21% in 1995.

At yearend 2003 more than half of all probationers were white (2,298,600);
almost a third were black (1,209,000); and an eighth were of Hispanic 
origin (491,700). Persons of other races comprised about 2% of probationers
(74,800).  

Half of all probationers convicted of a felony; a quarter
convicted of a drug law violation

Probationers are criminal offenders who have been sentenced to a period of
conditional supervision in the community. At yearend 2003, 49% had been
convicted of a felony offense.

Forty-seven percent of probationers had a direct sentence to probation; 29%
had received a sentence to incarceration that had been suspended; and 9% 
had received a split sentence which included incarceration followed by
probation. An additional 12% had entered probation before completion of 
all court proceedings (including those who entered probation
before final verdict).

About 7 in 10 probationers were under active supervision and were required 
to regularly report to a probation authority in person, by mail, or by
telephone. The percentage of probationers required to report regularly 
dropped steadily, from 79% in 1995 to 76% in 2000 and to 71% in 2003.

At yearend 2003, 1 in 9 probationers had absconded: though still on 
probation, they had failed to report and could not be located. Among all
persons on probation, absconders increased from 9% in 1995 to 11% in 2003.

In 2003, 25% of probationers had a drug law violation; 17% were sentenced 
for driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol; 12% for
larceny/theft; and 9% for other assault, excluding sexual assault and 
domestic violence. Fewer than 10% were sentenced to probation for domestic
violence (7%), minor traffic offenses (6%), burglary (5%), fraud (4%), and
sexual assault (3%).

About 3 in 5 of the more than 2 million adults discharged from probation in
2003 had successfully met the conditions of their supervision. The percentage
of probationers discharged from probation supervision because of incarceration
due to a rule violation or new offense varied from 21% in 1995 to 15%
in 2000 to 16% in 2003. Another 4% of those discharged had absconded, and 13%
had their probation sentence revoked without incarceration.
---------------------------------------------

Parole growth in 2003 almost double average annual
growth since 1995

Also serving time in the community at the end of 2003 were 774,588 adults on
parole. Parole is a period of conditional supervised release following a
prison term. Prisoners may be released to parole either by a parole board
decision or by mandatory conditional release.

The 3.1% growth in parole during 2003 -- a net increase of 23,654 parolees --
was almost double the average annual increase of 1.7% in parole since 1995.
This was also the largest increase in the parole population from 1995 to 
2003. Nearly all parolees had been convicted of a felony (95%).

17 States report double-digit increases in parole
populations

For the year ending December 31, 2003, 17 States reported an increase of 10%
or more in their parole population. North Dakota led with 53%, followed by
four other States exceeding 20%: Alabama (31%), Kentucky (27%), New Hampshire
(25%), and New Mexico (23%).

A total of 12 States reported a decrease in their adult parole population
during 2003. Hawaii's decrease of 11% for the year ending December 31, was
followed by three other States with a decrease of 5% or more.

Women accounted for 1 of every 8 adults on parole
in 2003 

About 1 of every 8 adults on parole in 2003 (96,900) were women. The female
parole population has increased steadily: from 10% in 1995 to 12% in 2000 to
13% in 2003. 

About 41% of adults on parole on December 31, 2003, were black (316,900); 40%
were white (309,900).  Almost 1 in 5 parolees were Hispanic (136,700). About
1% were of other races (11,200).  

Since 1995 mandatory releases to parole have
increased
 
Discretionary releases of prisoners to parole supervision by a parole board
have decreased from 50% of adults entering parole in 1995 to 39%, or 178,800,
in 2003. Mandatory releases to parole supervision increased from 45% in 1995
to 51% (237,500) in 2003.

At yearend 2003 more than 4 of every 5 parolees were under active supervision
and were required to maintain regular contact with the paroling agency. About
7% of parolees were absconders and could not be located.

About 2 of every 5 parolees discharged from supervision
returned to incarceration 

Of the more than 470,500 parolees discharged from supervision in 2003, 47% had
successfully met the conditions of their supervision. The success rate among
those discharged from parole remained fairly stable after 1995 (45% in 1995,
43% in 2000, and 47% in 2003). 

Of those parolees discharged in 2003, 38% had been returned to incarceration
either because of a rule violation or new offense. Another 9% had absconded,
and 1% had failed to successfully meet the conditions of supervision but were
discharged without incarceration.  

Correctional supervision rate highest in Texas and lowest
in New Hampshire

Texas led the Nation at yearend 2003 with 4,609 adults under correctional
supervision per 100,000 adult State residents, followed by Washington State
(4,350), and Delaware (4,235). New Hampshire (974 per 100,000), West Virginia
(991), and North Dakota (1,189) had the fewest adults on probation or
parole or in prison or jail relative to their State populations.

Offenders on probation or parole represented 70% of all persons under
correctional supervision at yearend.  The eight States with the highest 
rates of correctional supervision were also the eight States with the highest
rates of probation supervision, except for Massachusetts, which ranked 12th 
in correctional supervision but 6th in probation supervision.  

Minnesota with 3,411 persons under supervision per 100,000 adult residents 
had the lowest percentage incarcerated (11% of all persons under supervision).
Other States with a low percentage incarcerated included Vermont (with 12%),
Rhode Island (with 13%), and Washington State and Massachusetts (each with
15%). Mississippi with 56% of its correctional population incarcerated had 
the highest percentage among States, followed by Virginia (55%) and West
Virginia (51%).

Methodology

The Annual Probation and Parole Surveys provide a count of the total number 
of persons supervised in the community on January 1 and December 31, 2003, 
and a count of the number entering and leaving supervision during the year.
These surveys cover all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal
system. The first annual report on probation and parole appeared in 1979.

Data for the Federal system are from the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts as provided to the BJS Federal Justice Statistics Program.

Because many States update their population counts, the January 1, 2003,
numbers may differ from those previously published for December 31, 2002.

Probation  

The 2003 Annual Probation Survey was sent to 469 respondents -- 34 central
State reporters, the District of Columbia, the Federal system, and 433
separate State, county, or court agencies. States with multiple reporters
were Alabama (3), Arizona (2), Colorado (9), Florida (43), Georgia (5), 
Idaho (2), Kentucky (3), Michigan (128), Missouri (2), Montana (4), New 
Mexico (2), Ohio (187), Oklahoma (3), Tennessee (3), Washington (35),
and West Virginia (2). A locality in Ohio did not provide data. For this
agency, the 12/31/02 population count was used as the 1/1/03 and 12/31/03
counts.  Misdemeanor data in Idaho was not available. The 12/31/02
misdemeanor population count was used as the 1/1/03 and 12/31/03 counts. 

Since 1997 the survey coverage has been expanded to include 186 additional
agencies. At yearend 2003, 193,607 probationers were under the supervision 
of these agencies. For year-to-year comparisons, use total counts based on 
the same reporting agencies –- 3,266,837 in 1997 to compare with the final
1996 counts; 3,417,613 in 1998 to compare with final 1997; and 3,772,773 in
1999 to compare with final 1998.  

Entries to probation supervision were estimated for nonreporting agencies
beginning in 1995 and 2000-2003. Reported entries for the period were as
follows: 1,578,182 in 1995, 1,963,414 in 2000, 1,918,640 in 2001, 1,888,485
in 2002, and 1,918,470 in 2003.  

Parole  

The 2003 Annual Parole Survey was sent to 54 respondents, including 52 central
reporters, the California Youth Authority, and 1 municipal agency. States with
multiple reporters were Alabama (2) and California (2). 

Federal parole as defined here includes supervised release, parole, military
parole, special parole, and mandatory release.
