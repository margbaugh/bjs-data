------------------------------------------------------------

On June 30, 2004, a total of 68 jails in Indian country held
1,745 inmates, based on the 2004 Survey of Jails in Indian 
Country (SJIC). The inmate population declined 4% from the 
previous year when 70 facilities held 1,826 inmates. The 
juvenile population dropped 29% between midyear 2003 and 
2004.

The 68 facilities had a combined rated capacity to hold 
2,162 persons, down 3% from the previous year. At midyear 
2004, the jails were operating at 81% of capacity, down 
slightly from 82% at midyear 2003. On an average day in June
2004, the jails were operating at 75% of capacity; and on
their peak day in the month at 9% over capacity. The number 
of inmates on the peak day in June 2004 was down 6% from 
2003 and down 14% from 2002. 

Among the 1,428 inmates for whom offense was reported, nearly
two-fifths (39%)were being held for a violent offense at 
midyear 2004. This included 18% being held for domestic 
violence, 13% for aggravated or simple assault, 2% for 
rape or sexual assault, and 6% for other violent offenses.
Fourteen percent of inmates were confined for DWI/DUI, and 
7% were held for a drug offense.

Tribes retain jurisdiction over many 
crimes by American Indians and Alaska
Natives in Indian country

Thirty-three States contain about 300 Indian lands or
reservations. The local governing authority on Indian lands 
is typically a tribal government or council. Jurisdiction 
over crimes in Indian country depends on several factors, 
including the identity of the victim and the offender, the 
severity of the crime, and the location of the crime. (See 
box.) Tribal rights to sentence offenders is limited to 1 
year of imprisonment, or a $5,000 fine, or both(25 U.S.C. 
sec 1302(7)). 

Overall State, Federal, local, and Tribal authorities were
supervising 54,915 American Indians. (American Indians in 
this report include Alaska Natives.) Most were under community 
supervision (31,738). A total of 23,177 American Indians were 
in custody at midyear 2004. Nearly half were being held in 
State prisons(11,485).

City or county jails held more than four times as many 
American Indians as jails in Indian country. At midyear 2004 
local jails held an estimated 7,500 American Indians, some of 
whom may have been adjudicated by a Tribal criminal justice 
system and housed in jails under contracts with Tribal, city, 
or county governments.

Criminal jurisdiction in Indian country

Tribal jurisdiction
* Crimes committed by Indians in Indian 
country. Sentences are limited to 1 year  
and a $5,000 fine per offense or both. 
25 U.S.C. § 1302(7)

Federal jurisdiction
* 14 crimes under the Major Crimes Act 
of 1885. 18 U.S.C. § 1153 

State jurisdiction
* All crimes on tribal lands specified under 
Public Law 280, 18 U.S.C. § 1162

Note: Criminal jurisdiction in Indian country 
depends on several factors, including the 
identity of the defendant, victim, type of 
offense, and where the crime was committed.
---------------------------------------

On July 1, 2004, according to the U.S. Census Bureau 2,824,751 
American Indians and Alaska Natives lived in the Unites States
(National Population Estimates, table NC-EST2004-03). American 
Indians account for under 1% of the U.S. resident population 
and 1% of those in jails or prisons. 

At midyear 2004 Tribal authorities, State or Federal prisons,
or local jails held 820 American Indians per 100,000, an 
incarceration rate based on 23,177 American Indians in custody 
and 2.8 million residents. The rate for American Indians was 
about 13% higher than the overall national rate, 725 persons 
of all races per 100,000 U.S. residents.

Indian country jail population 
declined 4% between midyear 2003 
and midyear 2004

The number of inmates in custody on June 30, 2004, decreased
4% from the previous year, down to 1,745 inmates from 1,826.

inmates were held in June 2003; the smallest in November
2003.

At midyear 2004 Indian country jails held 1,546 adults, 79%
of whom were males and 21% females. Juveniles (persons under 
age 18) accounted for 11% of the total custody population. 
Nearly 63% of juveniles were males; 37% were females. At 
midyear 2004,3 juveniles were being held as adults, down 
from 5 in 2003 and 11 in 2002.

2004 from 58 at midyear 2003. A total of 94 inmates were 
being held for other reasons, including protective custody,
court-ordered treatment, detoxification, public intoxication,
and status offenses.

Overall, jails in Indian country held 966 convicted offenders
at midyear 2004, and 697 inmates were unconvicted or awaiting 
trial. The proportion of convicted inmates increased slightly, 
up to 58% of jail inmates at midyear 2004 from 56% at midyear 
2003.

Nearly 2 in 5 inmates held for a 
violent offense at midyear 2004

At midyear 2004, nearly two-fifths of inmates(39%)in Indian 
country jails were being held for a violent offense, up from

of alcohol or drugs, up from 11% in 2003. About 7% of inmates 
were being held for a drug law violation, down from 8% in 2003.  

Admissions down 2%; attempted  
suicides down 46%

Between June 1 and June 30, 2004, 12,219 persons were admitted

the inmates in the 10 largest jails were confined in 6
facilities in Arizona. 

At midyear 2004, two facilities each held 100 or more inmates, 
down from 3 facilities at midyear 2003: the Gila River 
Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the Tohono 
O'odham Detention Center. Each year since 1998 Gila River has 
held 100 or more inmates on June 30; and each year since 2000,
Tohono O'odham has held at least 100 inmates. 

On June 30, 2004, the number of inmates being held at the
Tohono O'odham Detention Center and Pine Ridge Correctional 
Facility was more than 3 times their operating capacity. 
Rosebud Sioux Tribe Law Enforce-ment reported the lowest 
operating capacity (at 65%) of the 10 largest jails in
Indian country.

91% of jails housed fewer than 50 
inmates

Over the past 3 years the number of facilities that held 50
or more inmates has steadily declined. At midyear 2004, 9%

for multiple occupants; 4% were double bunked in single cells; 
1% were housed in areas not originally intended for confinement, 
and 2% were in holding areas or "drunk tanks." Twelve percent 
of all inmates were housed in single cells or rooms. (Not 
shown on table.) 

Jails were operating at 81% of 
capacity on June 30, 2004; at 109%

The 68 jails had a combined rated capacity to hold 2,162 
persons at midyear 2004, nearly a 3% decrease from 2,222 at 
midyear 2003. Indian country jails were operating at 81% of 
capacity on June 30, 2004, down from 82% in 2003 and 92% in 
2002.

On their peak day in June 2004, jails held 2,356 inmates,

and New Mexico (2). The number of facilities operating over 
150% of capacity was down from 16 in 2003 and 19 in 2002.
(See Jails in Indian Country, 2003 and 2002).

The Fort Berthold facility in North Dakota reported the
highest occupancy rate on their peak day in June(23 inmates 
over capacity or 388%), followed by Tohono O'odham Detention 
Center in Arizona (87 inmates or 356%), and Pine Ridge 
Correctional Facility in South Dakota (55 inmates or 350%).

Small facilities reported the highest 
occupancy rates

Nine facilities with a rated capacity to hold fewer than 10
inmates reported the highest occupancy rates(138%)on their 
peak day in June 2004, down from 182% in 2003. Occupancy was 
130% of capacity in jails rated to hold 10 to 24 inmates,

addendum about policies and
programs for inmates services

An addendum to the 2004 Annual Survey of Jails in Indian
Country was introduced to obtain in-depth data on inmate 
health services and facility programs. For the first time,

HIV, hepatitis B and C, and tuberculosis. Data were also 
collected on inmate medical services, mental health services, 
suicide prevention procedures, substance dependency programs, 
domestic violence counseling, sex offender treatment, 
educational programs, and inmate work assignments. Forty-

Methodology

The Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) includes all
Indian country correctional facilities operated by tribal 
authorities or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. 
Department of the Interior.

"Indian country" is a statutory term that includes the
following: all lands within an Indian reservation, dependent 
Indian communities, and Indian trust allotments(18 U.S.C. 
sec 1151). Courts interpret sec 1151 to include all lands
held in trust for tribes or their members. See United States
v. Roberts. 185 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 1999). Tribal authority 
to imprison Indian offenders is limited to 1 year per offense 
by statute (25 U.S.C. sec 1302), $5,000 fine, or both.

Tribal law enforcement agencies act as first responders to
both felony and misdemeanor crimes. For most of Indian country, 
the Federal Government provides felony law enforcement 
concerning crimes by or against Indians. Certain areas of 
Indian country are under Public Law 83-280, as amended. P.L.
280 conferred jurisdiction on certain States over "Indian
country" and suspended enforcement of the Major Crimes Act 
(18 U.S.C. 1153) and the General Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. sec 
1152)in those areas. Indian tribes retain concurrent 
jurisdiction to enforce laws in Indian country where P.L. 280 
applies. 

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducted the Survey
of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) to describe all adult and 
juvenile jail facilities and detention centers in Indian 
country. For purposes of this report, Indian country includes 
reservations, pueblos, rancherias, and other appropriate
areas (18 U.S.C.sec 1151). The reference date for the most
recent survey is June 30, 2004. 

The SJIC was initiated in 1998 as a component of the Annual
Survey of Jails (ASJ). The ASJ is conducted in each of the 
years between the Census of Jails. The 2004 ASJ consisted of 
a sample survey of 878 local jail jurisdictions, a survey of 
the Nation's 55 multi-jurisdictional facilities, and a 
survey of the 68 facilities in Indian country. (For sampling 
information, see Prison and Jails Inmates at Midyear 2004, 
BJS Bulletin, April 2005,
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/pjim04.htm>.)

In 1998 the Office of Law Enforcement Services, Bureau of 
Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. Department of the Interior, 
provided a complete list of 74 Indian country jail facilities. 
The list included detention centers, jails, and other 
correctional facilities, operated by tribal authorities or
the BIA. Since 1998, 3 facilities were added, 6 were closed, 
2 facilities were abandoned, and 2 were combined into 1 
facility, resulting in 68 surveyed facilities. The facilities 
are located in 19 States and are affiliated with 55 tribes.

Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Through follow-
up phone calls and facsimiles, 61 out of 68 facilities 
responded. Data for the San Carlos Jail, Supai Jail, White 
Mountain Apache Police Department, Jicarilla Police Department, 
and Wind River Police Department are from June 30, 2003. Data 
for the Tohono O'odham Judiciary Juvenile Detention Center and 
Ponca Tribal Police Department are from June 28, 2002.

In 2004, the survey included an addendum that collected in-
depth data on inmate health services and facility programs. 
Forty-five out of 68 facilities responded to the addendum.
