Mortality in Local Jails and State 
Prisons, 2000–2012 - Statistical Tables

Margaret E. Noonan, BJS Statistician, 
and Scott Ginder, RTI International

In 2012, 4,309 inmates died while in the custody of local jails or state 
prisons—an increase of 2% (67 deaths) from 2011. The number of deaths in 
local jails increased, from 889 in 2011 to 958 in 2012, which marked the 
first increase since 2009 (figure 1). The increase in deaths in local 
jails was primarily due to an increase in illness-related deaths (up 
24%).These deaths accounted for 97% of the total increase in deaths in 
jails and prisons in 2012. The overall mortality rate in local jails 
increased 4%, from 123 deaths per 100,000 local jail inmates in 2011 to 
128 deaths per 100,000 in 2012.

Suicide continued to be the leading cause of death in local jails (40 
suicides per 100,000 jail inmates); however, the suicide rate declined 
4% in 2012 and has declined 17% since 2000. Heart disease was the 
leading cause of illness-related deaths in local jails, increasing 14% 
in 2012. 

The rate of AIDS-related deaths in local jails increased from 2 deaths 
per 100,000 inmates in 2011 to 3 per 100,000 in 2012, the first increase 
since 2006. Despite the increase in 2012, AIDS-related deaths have 
decreased 63% in jails since 2000.

Most jail jurisdictions (81%) reported no deaths in 2012, which was 
consistent with previous years. Mortality in jails varied by size of 
jail population between 2000 and 2012. The smallest jail jurisdictions 
had the highest mortality rates, but these jurisdictions averaged less 
than 1 death annually (figure 2).

In 2012, a total of 3,351 deaths (78% of all deaths in correctional 
facilities) occurred in state prisons, which was nearly equal to the 
number of deaths in 2011 (3,353). Although the number of deaths in state 
prisons remained constant, the overall mortality rate in prisons 
increased 2% in 2012. The increase from 2011 to 2012 was largely due to 
decrease in the prison population.

In 2012, cancer continued to be the leading cause of death in state 
prisons, and the cancer mortality rate remained stable. The mortality 
rate for heart disease—the second leading cause of death in state 
prisons—decreased 5% in 2012. For the first time since 2005, the rate of 
AIDS-related deaths in prisons increased from 4 deaths per 100,000 
prisoners in 2011 to 6 per 100,000 in 2012. Despite the rate increase, 
the number of AIDS-related deaths in state prisons has declined 73% 
since 2001.

Data in this report were developed from the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics’ (BJS) Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP), an annual 
data collection about inmate deaths in local jails and state prisons. 
The program began collecting data from jails in 2000 and from prisons in 
2001. This report covers deaths in custody occurring in local jails and 
state prisons between 2000 and 2012. Statistical tables provide 
information about the causes and circumstances of local jail and state 
prison inmate deaths and present trends by cause of death, selected 
decedent characteristics, and mortality rates for jail and prison 
inmates by state.

*****************************
Mortality in local jails 
*****************************

Cause of death
****************

* The number of deaths in local jails increased 8%, from 889 deaths in 
2011 to 958 in 2012. This marked the first annual increase in the number 
of deaths in local jails since 2009 (table 1).

* Illness-related deaths accounted for over half (55%) of all deaths in 
local jails in 2012. Heart disease (28%) continued to be the leading 
cause of illness-related deaths in local jails in 2012 (table 2).

* The overall mortality rate in local jails increased 4%, from 123 deaths 
per 100,000 local jail inmates in 2011 to 128 per 100,000 in 2012. This 
was the first substantial increase since the mortality rate declined 13% 
in 2008 (table 3).

Decedent characteristics
***************************

* While suicide continued to be the leading cause of death in local jails 
(40 suicides per 100,000 jail inmates), the suicide rate declined 4% in 
2012.

* In 2012, males accounted for 836 deaths in local jails, and females 
accounted for 122 deaths. Male inmate deaths made up 84% of the total 
increase in jail inmate deaths in 2012 (table 4).

* More than a third (36%) of deaths in local jails occurred within 7 days 
of admission (table 5).

* Inmates age 45 or older experienced the largest increase in mortality 
among all age groups (up 16%) and accounted for about half (51%) of all 
deaths in jail facilities in 2012 (table 5).

* Mortality rates among non-Hispanic white inmates and non-Hispanic black 
inmates increased in 2012, while mortality rates decreased for Hispanic 
inmates (table 6).

* The average annual suicide rate for white jail inmates between 2000 and 
2012 (80 suicides per 100,000 jail inmates) remained at least three 
times higher than any other race or Hispanic origin (table 8).

Facility characteristics
**************************

* The majority (81%) of jails reported no deaths in 2012, which was 
consistent with previous years (table 9).
Among the 538 jail jurisdictions that reported an inmate death, the 
majority (373) reported a single death.

* In 2012, California’s jail population increased 11%, while the national 
jail population increased 4% (table 11).
Mortality in state prisons

Cause of death
***************

* A total of 3,351 deaths occurred in state prisons in 2012—two fewer 
deaths than in 2011 (table 15).

* Illness-related deaths accounted for the majority (88%) of deaths in 
state prisons (table 16).

   * In 2012, cancer remained the leading cause of death in prisons (81 
deaths per 100,000 state prisoners), followed by heart disease (63 per 
100,000) (table 17).

   * The AIDS-related mortality rate (up 32%) increased for the first time 
ince the DCRP began collecting prison data in 2001, from 4 deaths per 
100,000 state prisoners in 2011 to 6 per 100,000 in 2012.

* The homicide rate in state prisons increased 24%, from 5 homicides per 
100,000 state prisoners in 2011 to 7 per 100,000 in 2012.

Decedent characteristics
*************************

* Male prisoners accounted for the majority (97%) of deaths in state 
prisons in 2012 (table 19).
* Persons age 55 or older made up more than half (55%) of deaths in 
prisons.

* Male prisoners accounted for nearly all (99%) homicides in state prisons 
from 2001 to 2012 (table 21).

* Suicide (5%) was the most common unnatural cause of death among female 
prisoners from 2001 to 2012.

* Male prisoners had higher mortality rates than female prisoners, 
regardless of cause of death (table 22).

* From 2001 to 2012, the average annual mortality rate for male prisoners 
(260 deaths per 100,000 state prisoners) was 1.7 times higher than for 
female prisoners (149 per 100,000) (table 22).

* With the exception of AIDS-related deaths, white prisoners had the 
highest average annual mortality rate for all illness-related causes of 
death from 2001 to 2012. AIDS-related deaths were highest among black 
prisoners (18 deaths per 100,000 state prisoners) and were at least two 
times higher than for prisoners of different races or Hispanic origin.

* From 2001 to 2012, the suicide rate for prisoners age 17 or younger was 
nearly two times higher than for older inmates.

* The total state prison population in custody declined 2% in 2012. Most 
demographic groups exhibited some population decline; however, the 
populations for inmates ages 17 or younger and 54 and older increased 
(table 23).

Deaths by jurisdiction
***************************

* The number of deaths in federal prisons (350 deaths) declined 10% in 
2012, the first decrease in the previous 2 years (table 24).

* The mortality rate of federal prisoners declined, from 220 deaths per 
100,000 federal prisoners in 2011 to 198 per 100,000 in 2012 (table 25).

* California state prisons reported 22 fewer deaths in 2012 than in 2011—
the smallest number of deaths reported by California (366 deaths) since 
2005. The observed increase in the mortality is largely due to the 
decrease in the California prison population.

* From 2001 to 2012, the average annual mortality rate for state prisoners 
varied by state. The median mortality rate across all states was 242 deaths 
per 100,000 state prisoners (table 27).

* Overall mortality rates and mortality rates by state and cause of death 
may not be directly compared between states due to differences in age, 
sex, race or Hispanic origin, and other decedent characteristics.

Methodology
************

Data collection coverage
**************************

The Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP) is an annual Bureau of 
Justice Statistics (BJS) data collection. The DCRP collects national, 
state, and incident-level data on persons who died while in the physical 
custody of the 50 state departments of corrections or the approximately 
2,800 local adult jail jurisdictions nationwide. The DCRP began in 2000 
under the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-297), and it 
is the only national statistical collection to obtain comprehensive 
information about deaths in adult correctional facilities. BJS uses DCRP 
data to track national trends in the number and causes (or manners) of 
deaths occurring in state prison or local jail custody. 

Mortality data measured by the DCRP include decedent characteristics, 
such as age, sex, race or Hispanic origin, date of admission, conviction 
status, admission offense, and the location and type of facility (prison 
or jail) where the inmate died. The DCRP also collects data about 
circumstances surrounding the death, including the cause, time and 
location where the death occurred, and information on whether an autopsy 
was conducted and the availability of results to the respondent. Data on 
executions are excluded from this report but are accessible on the BJS 
website along with the DCRP mortality data. Statistics presented in this 
report are current as of March 1, 2014. For more information on 
mortality in correctional settings, see Mortality in Local Jails, 2000–
2007 (NCJ 222988, BJS web, July 2010); Medical Causes of Death in State 
Prisons, 2001–2004 (NCJ 216340, BJS web, January 2007); and Suicide and 
Homicide in State Prisons and Local Jails (NCJ 210036, BJS web, August 
2005).

The DCRP data collection instruments are administered annually to both 
state prisons and local jails. Respondents provide an aggregate count of 
the number of deaths that occurred during the referenced calendar year. 
The jail (CJ-9) and prison (NPS-4A) survey instruments used to obtain 
data on each prison and jail death are available on the BJS website at 
www.bjs.gov. 

In addition to the death count, BJS requests that jails that provide 
summary statistics about their population and admissions. All jails, 
including those with no deaths to report (which includes about 80% of 
jails in any given year) are asked to complete the annual summary survey 
form. BJS obtains a separate report describing the decedent’s 
characteristics and the circumstances surrounding the death for each 
death that occurred in a state prison or local jail. State prison and 
local jail respondents can submit individual records on decedents at any 
time during a collection cycle through a BJS web-based collection 
system.

BJS has modified the survey instruments slightly over time, including 
changes to clarify questions and ease the burden on respondents. Several 
questions were added to capture information on any medical treatment 
that the inmate received prior to death. Changes also allowed 
respondents to elaborate on cause of death by adding text boxes to the 
intoxication, suicide, and inmate-involved homicide death questions. 
Previously, these fields had only been available for deaths due to 
illness, accident, homicides not caused by other inmates, and other 
unspecified causes. In addition, BJS clarified respondent instructions 
on the prison forms and removed a question collecting the conviction 
status of an inmate after an analysis showed that more than 99% of 
prison inmates were convicted at the time of death. BJS also streamlined 
the survey layout to simplify the progression through questions related 
to autopsies. Rather than initially submitting an incomplete instrument 
that indicated pending autopsy results, respondents were only permitted 
to complete the entire survey after autopsy results were available. This 
change reduced follow-up contact and the burden on respondents.
Starting in 2001 and annually thereafter, BJS has collected DCRP data 
directly from state prison systems, maintaining a 100% response rate.

Nonresponse
***************

The jail universe includes all jails currently operating and jails that 
have been contacted for the DCRP but have closed, consolidated, or 
otherwise eliminated operations. This universe allows BJS to determine 
jail participation in the DCRP. The most recent jail universe, 
constructed in January 2014, identified 2,812 jurisdictions representing 
3,245 jail facilities. Of these, 2,805 (99.7%) participated in the DCRP—
an increase from previous years. An additional 59 jail jurisdictions 
reported to the DCRP by yearend 2012.

The congressionally mandated Death in Custody Act expired at yearend 
2006. Starting in 2007, participation in DCRP became voluntary. As a 
result, three jail jurisdictions no longer report data to the program.

A jail jurisdiction is a legal entity that has responsibility for 
managing jail facilities. Jail jurisdictions typically operate at the 
county level, in which a sheriff’s office or jail administrator manages 
the local facilities. The DCRP data identify the jail facility in which 
a jail inmate dies, but the data are arrayed at the jail jurisdiction 
level. BJS defines a jail as a locally operated correctional facility 
that confines persons before or after adjudication for more than 72 
hours, excluding temporary lockups. Typically, there is one facility per 
jail jurisdiction, but the 2006 Census of Jail Facilities found that 15% 
of jail jurisdictions had multiple facilities under a central authority. 
(See the BJS website for more information.)

Determining eligibility for 
reporting to the DCRP
*****************************

In the DCRP, custody refers to the holding of an inmate in a facility or 
to the period during which a correctional authority maintains a chain of 
custody over an inmate. For instance, if a jail transports an ill inmate 
to a hospital for medical services and that inmate dies while in the 
chain of custody of the jail, then that death is counted as a death in 
custody. A death that occurs when an inmate is not in the custody of a 
correctional authority is considered beyond the scope of the DCRP. Out-
of-scope deaths include inmates on escape status or under the 
supervision of community corrections on probation, parole, or home-
electronic monitoring. BJS instructs both state prison and local jail 
officials to determine whether the inmate was in the physical custody of 
the jurisdiction at the time of death, regardless of the reason an 
inmate was being held. For state prisons responding to the survey, 
inmates in physical custody include those held in any private prison 
facility under contract to the responding state’s department of 
corrections or in any of their state-operated facilities, including 
halfway houses, prison camps or farms, training or treatment centers, 
and prison hospitals. 

BJS instructs state prison officials to exclude deaths of inmates who 
were transferred to local jails while still serving a prison term 
because the DCRP obtains information about such deaths through the jail 
reports. Jail inmate custody includes inmates who are temporarily out of 
the jail facility but are within the chain of custody of the jail. For 
example, a death in custody would include a jail inmate who died after 
being transferred to an offsite facility that cares for critically ill 
persons. From 2000 to 2012, the DCRP data have shown that about 84% of 
jail deaths occurring in medical facilities have occurred in an outside 
of the jail facility. 

Custody is further complicated by the dual law enforcement and jail 
administration functions of some sheriffs’ offices. As a result, some 
deaths reported as jail deaths actually occurred before the jail had 
custody of the decedent. BJS identifies and excludes from the DCRP these 
deaths that occurred in the process of arrest by using information about 
the circumstances surrounding the death. 

Identifying and excluding 
duplicate records 
*****************************

Duplicate death records may occur in the DCRP due to overlapping 
correctional populations and overlapping duties within correctional 
facilities. For example, a jail jurisdiction may have more than one unit 
responsible for reporting data to BJS, a jail may be holding a state 
prison inmate, or state prison systems may report the death of an inmate 
who was transferred to a local jail but was serving a prison sentence at 
the time.

To identify duplicate death records, BJS reconciles the aggregate 
summary counts of deaths occurring during a calendar year with the 
number of individual death records obtained from a reporting 
jurisdiction. When discrepancies are identified, BJS contacts reporting 
jurisdictions to clarify matters. However, even if summary counts and 
individual reports are reconciled, duplicate death records may exist if 
multiple reporting units within a jurisdiction provide reconciled data.

Duplicate records occur primarily in reports from jail jurisdictions 
that have multiple reporting entities. To identify duplicate records, 
BJS performs record-matching based on inmate name and date of birth, 
date of death, and date of admission into a correctional facility. After 
the aggregate count review, BJS searches for deaths reported to both the 
jail and prison DCRP collections, which most commonly occur when a local 
jail is housing an inmate for the state department of corrections. The 
death is considered part of the count of the facility that had custody 
of the inmate at the time of death, and the duplicate record is deleted.

Duplicate and out-of-scope records are excluded from the analyses.

Cause-of-death information
*****************************

The instructions for completing the DCRP tell respondents to report 
death information as determined by an autopsy or other official medical 
death investigation. For this collection, intoxication deaths, 
accidents, suicides, and homicides are considered discrete causes of 
death. Although there is a distinction between manner and cause of death 
from a medico-legal standpoint, no such distinction is made in the DCRP. 
When reporting a death due to illness, accident, suicide, intoxication, 
or homicide, BJS requests that respondents describe the events 
surrounding these deaths. 

Clinical data specialists convert illness-related death text entries 
into standard medical codes according to the World Health Organization’s 
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10).

Homicides include all types of intentional homicide and involuntary 
manslaughter as ruled by a medical examiner or pathologist at autopsy. 
For example, an inmate may die of positional asphyxia (suffocation 
caused by the position of the inmate’s body) while the inmate is being 
removed from a cell. A legal-intervention homicide committed while the 
inmate is trying to escape would also be included. In addition, 
homicides include cases that are ruled a homicide at autopsy when events 
that led to the death occurred prior to incarceration. For example, an 
inmate who was shot in the community years prior to incarceration died 
from complications of the gunshot wound while incarcerated. 

Other BJS sources of correctional 
mortality data
************************************

BJS collects other data reported to the DCRP on correctional mortality. 
These other collections include—

* Capital Punishment, which provides data on legal executions. Further 
discussion on executions is available on the BJS website.

* The National Prisoner Statistics (NPS), which annually collected 
aggregate counts of deaths in state and federal prisons prior to the 
establishment of the DCRP. Prior to 2007, the NPS also collected counts 
of deaths by cause of death, including deaths due to execution, illness, 
AIDS, suicide, accident, homicide, and other causes. After 2006, the 
Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) continued to submit the counts of deaths 
by cause of death using the DCRP, but no longer provided counts of 
deaths using the NPS. Further discussion of the NPS is available on the 
BJS website.

* The Census of Jails, conducted every 5 to 6 years, provides counts of 
inmate deaths in local jails. Further discussion of the Census of Jails 
is available on the BJS website.

* The Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC), which provides aggregate 
counts of the number of deaths occurring in all known Indian country 
correctional facilities operated by tribal authorities or the U.S. 
Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Indian Affairs. Further 
discussion of the SJIC is available on the BJS website.

Reported statistics 
**********************

Mortality data are shown in statistical tables by type of correctional 
institution (state prisons and local jails) and include the number of 
deaths and mortality rates by year, cause of death, selected decedent 
characteristics, and state.

Mortality rates are calculated per 100,000 inmates, with the 
denominators providing estimates of the number of person-years of 
exposure in custody in institutional corrections. Until 2010, the 
mortality rate for state prisons was calculated as the number of deaths 
per year divided by the midyear state prison population in custody 
multiplied by 100,000. Starting in 2011, the rate was calculated using 
yearend custody counts because midyear populations were no longer 
available. Custody counts for state prisons provide estimates of person-
years for prison populations. BJS uses data from the NPS to provide 
midyear and yearend custody counts of prisoners. For more information on 
the NPS, see the BJS website.

The mortality rate in local jails is calculated as the number of deaths 
per year divided by the jail inmate average daily population (ADP) 
multiplied by 100,000. The ADP for local jails is defined as the average 
daily number of jail inmates held in a jail jurisdiction during a 
calendar year, from January 1 through December 31. 

The ADP is used as the denominator for jail mortality rates to 
accommodate the high turnover and daily fluctuation in local jail 
populations. Also, the ADP better reflects the number of inmate days per 
year than a 1-day count. Jail populations have a higher turnover than 
prison populations; mean length of stay in local jails is about 21 days, 
compared to 2 years in state prisons.
 
The jail ADP also reflects the annual number of admissions and mean 
length of stay, and can be expressed as the product of these two values. 
When mean length of stay is expressed in years, the ADP is equivalent to 
the number of person-years spent by jail inmates during a given year. 
BJS obtains the jail ADP data directly from jails through the DCRP using 
the summary form CJ-9A. Starting in 2002, BJS collected the ADP directly 
from respondents. Prior to 2002, BJS calculated the jail ADP by taking 
the average of the January 1 count from the prior year and the December 
31 count from the reference year, which is an appropriate proxy measure 
for the ADP.

Both denominators provide for annualizing mortality rates, which are 
calculated separately by group or by characteristic. The annualized 
mortality rates in state prisons and local jails are comparable to 
annual crude mortality rates reported by the National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS). 

The NCHS calculates crude mortality rates as the number of events for a 
period (e.g., a year) divided by the population estimate at the midpoint 
of the period. For general population mortality statistics, the NCHS 
employs the midyear population as an approximation to the average 
population exposed to risk of death during any given year. 
***Footnote 1 See Siegal, J. & Swanson, D. (2004). The Methods and Materials of Demography, Second Edition. San Diego, CA: 
Elsevier Academic Press, 269.***

The crude mortality rates reported in the DCRP annual statistical tables 
are not directly comparable to the crude mortality rates within the 
(nonincarcerated) general population, and the crude mortality rates in 
state prisons are not directly comparable to those of local jails. The 
composition of the general population (i.e., age, sex, and race or 
Hispanic origin) differs from the population in state prisons and local 
jails. Because mortality is correlated with age, sex, and race or 
Hispanic origin, the crude mortality rates in state prisons, local 
jails, and the general population should not be compared. 

Individual inmate death records collected annually in the death file are 
included in the national death count. Independent jail-specific summary 
death counts are collected in the annual summary form (CJ-9A) and serve 
as control death totals. If the death count in the summary form file is 
greater than the count in the individual inmate death file, the summary 
file count is used as the total in calculating a jail mortality rate. 
For 2012, individual records for jail inmate deaths were adjusted to 
match independent counts of deaths occurring in each jail, and the 
mortality rates were adjusted accordingly.

Estimating inmate population 
characteristics to calculate mortality 
rates by demographic subgroups
***************************************

BJS does not obtain annual data for all demographic characteristics of 
prison and jail inmates in all jurisdictions. BJS uses data from sources 
other than the DCRP to estimate the nationwide composition of state 
prison and local jail inmate populations by age, sex, and race or 
Hispanic origin. These data sources consist primarily of periodic 
surveys of inmates in custody in prisons and jails. The inmate 
characteristic distributions obtained from these surveys are applied to 
denominators (i.e., counts of inmates or ADP) to estimate the number of 
inmates in each demographic subgroup.

BJS estimated the demographic distribution of the state prison 
population data from the NPS and National Corrections Reporting Program 
(NCRP) collections. For a discussion on the methodology for obtaining 
state prisoner distribution estimates by age, sex, and race or Hispanic 
origin, see Prisoners in 2011 (NCJ 239808, BJS web, December 2012).

Prior to using the NPS and NCRP to estimate demographic distributions, 
reports of mortality rates for state prison inmates used demographic 
distributions derived from BJS’s 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and 
Federal Correctional Facilities (SISCF). As a result, the state prison 
mortality rates shown in these tables may differ from previously 
published rates. A rate comparison between the two sources showed very 
little difference in the resultant mortality rates. In most instances, 
the rates either matched or nearly matched. The rates differed in only 
three instances: Hispanics in 2001, and females and inmates age 55 or 
older in 2002. In each instance, the rates calculated using population 
data from the NCRP and NPS were slightly higher (less than a 1% 
increase) than rates calculated using population data from the SISCF.

To estimate inmate demographic characteristic distributions of the ADP, 
BJS used data from several surveys to generate distributions of age, 
sex, and race or Hispanic origin and applied these distributions to the 
ADP. BJS’s Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) provided estimates of the sex 
distribution of inmates for each year of the DCRP collection and applied 
these to each year’s ADP from the DCRP to estimate the ADP of male and 
female jail inmates. Jail Inmates at Midyear 2010 - Statistical Tables 
(NCJ 233431, BJS web, April 2011) documents that the distributions of 
inmate characteristics have changed slowly over time. For the most 
recent information on the ASJ, see the BJS website.

To estimate the distribution of race and Hispanic origin of adult jail 
inmates, BJS used data from the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (SILJ) 
and the National Inmate Survey (NIS) to estimate the relative 
distribution of adults by race and Hispanic origin for different 
periods. Because the SILJ (2002) and the NIS (2007 to 2009) are not 
fielded annually, the population estimates were smoothed before being 
applied to DCRP data. BJS used the SILJ estimates to cover the period 
from 2000 to 2004 and the NIS estimates to cover the period from 2005 to 
2011. In both cases, the percentages associated with the distribution of 
race and Hispanic origin were applied to the adult jail ADP. For more 
information about jail inmates in 2002, see Profile of Jail Inmates, 
2002 (NCJ 201932, BJS web, July 2004).

To estimate the age distribution of the jail inmate population, BJS 
first obtained an estimate of the number of jail inmates age 17 or 
younger from the ASJ. According to table 2 in Jail Inmates at Midyear 
2012 - Statistical Tables (NCJ 241264, BJS web, May 2013), the annual 
number of jail inmates age 17 or younger ranged from 5,400 to 7,600 
inmates from 2000 to 2012. By applying the annual percentage of jail 
inmates age 17 or younger to the annual ADP, BJS obtained an estimate of 
the ADP of jail inmates age 17 or younger. 

To estimate the age distribution of adult jail inmates, BJS used data 
from the SILJ for 2000 to 2006 and the NIS for 2007 to 2012 to estimate 
the relative distribution of adults by age category for different 
periods. The age estimates were smoothed to account for gaps in 
reference years when age estimates were available, specifically for 
2003, 2006, 2010, and 2011.

Moving averages
******************
 
Moving averages were used to smooth short-term irregularities and to 
estimate long term trends. For instance, moving averages were computed 
to examine data trends for certain causes of death in jails and prisons 
while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. The data were cut into 
several 3-year overlapping periods spanning 12 years of prison data and 
13 years of jail data.

The moving averages in this report describe some changes in cause-
specific mortality rates over time (e.g., whether the overall decline in 
the AIDS-related mortality rate was steady, or whether the increase of 
suicides in jails was recent). Moving averages were not computed for all 
causes of death in custody because the resultant rates would have been 
unstable and therefore statistically meaningless due to small cell 
sizes.

Random error and suppression 
*******************************
  
The DCRP data on deaths in state prisons and local jails are not subject 
to sampling error. However, mortality data from a complete or near-
complete enumeration may be subject to random error. Following the 
methodology of Brillinger and NCHS, “the number of deaths that actually 
occurred may be considered as one of a large series of possible results 
that could have arisen under the same set of circumstances” (Xu, J. et 
al., 2010)., ***Footnote 2 ,3 See Brillinger, D.R. (1986). The Natural 
Variability of Vital Rates and Associated Statistics. Biometrics, 42, 
693–734. See Xu, J. et al. (2010). Deaths: Final Data for 2007. 
National Vital Statistics Report, 58(19). Retrieved from 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr58/nvsr58_19.pdf.*** 
The random variation can be large when the number of deaths is small. 
Therefore, caution is warranted when interpreting statistics based on 
small numbers of deaths. According to NCHS standards, mortality 
rates based on fewer than 100 deaths per year should be interpreted with 
caution.

Continuing to use the NCHS and Brillinger methods, BJS quantified random 
variation by assuming that the appropriate underlying probability 
distribution for the number of deaths is a Poisson distribution. This 
provides a computationally simple and reasonable approach for estimating 
variances in mortality statistics when the probability of dying is low. 
BJS calculated variances based on the assumption of a Poisson process. 
From these variances, BJS calculated relative random error estimates, 
which are comparable to relative standard error in that the relative 
random error is the ratio of random error derived from the Poisson 
variance to the number of deaths. Following NCHS, when the relative 
random error exceeded 30%, BJS flagged estimated mortality rates due to 
the instability of the rate with a “!” symbol (Interpret with caution; 
too few sample cases to provide a reliable rate).
 
Survey performance issues
***************************

Survey administration and modifications to the survey form generated 
data from 2007 to 2009 that may not be wholly compatible with prior DCRP 
data. In 2012, BJS identified a previously undetected data error that 
mischaracterized over 600 illness-related deaths as illness-related 
deaths missing detailed cause-of-death information. The data error lead 
to an inflated frequency of prison deaths in reference year 2007 being 
characterized as all other illnesses while simultaneously depressing 
frequencies of known illnesses (e.g., heart disease, cancer, and liver 
disease). The error was identified and resolved, correcting the 
distributions. In 2008, local jail officials were unable to provide 
causes of death for 21.4% of jail inmate deaths. During 2009, BJS made 
modifications to the collection instruments to improve reporting and 
reduce burden. 

* Item nonresponse in 2008 jail data and unknown cause of death: An 
abnormally large number of cases were missing a response for cause of 
death in the 2008 jail file (n=203; 21.4% of all jail deaths in 2008). 
This coincided with the final year the U.S. Census Bureau acted as the 
data collection agent for the DCRP. In prior years of the DCRP jail data 
collection, an average of 6% of all causes of death were classified as 
other or unknown. For this report, BJS categorized all 203 jail deaths 
from 2008 as missing data about cause of death.

* 2009 data collection: Prior to fielding the 2009 DCRP collection, BJS 
reviewed the data collection instrument and data submission procedures 
and assessed the communications with DCRP respondents to reduce the 
burden on respondents. The survey was modified to facilitate navigation 
and to encourage online response. The modifications led to delays in 
implementing data collection. As a result, death reports were not 
collected in the year the deaths occurred, but were instead collected 
retrospectively during 2010 for the first time. Data collection for 
subsequent years resumed on a normal schedule.
