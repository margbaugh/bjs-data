Federal arrests decreased from 188,164 in fiscal year 2013 to 165,265 
in fiscal year 2014. Arrests by federal law enforcement more than 
doubled between 1994 (80,450) and 2013, and then declined by 12% 
from 2013 to 2014 (figure 1).*** Footnote 1 In this report, annual data are 
or the fiscal year, which is from October 1 to September 30. A percentage 
change for multiple years is calculated using the average of the annual 
change between year***

At fiscal yearend 2014, about 400,000 offenders were under some 
form of federal correctional control. Nearly half (48%) were confined 
by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), 14% were confined in pretrial 
detention, 33% were on post-sentencing supervision in the community, 
and 6% were under pretrial supervision in the community (table 1).

This report describes defendants processed at each stage of the federal justice 
system: arrest, investigation and prosecution, pretrial detention, adjudication 
and sentencing, corrections, and supervision in the community. Data are from the 
Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP). The FJSP collects, standardizes, and 
reports on administrative data received from six federal justice agencies: the U.S. 
Marshals Service (USMS), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Administrative Office 
of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC), Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the BOP, and the 
U.S. Sentencing Commission.

Arrest
**********

This section of the report uses most serious offense type as classified 
by the deputy U.S. Marshal at the time of booking. Each of the 94 federal 
judicial districts has a U.S. Marshal. Deputy U.S. Marshals take into custody 
federal suspects charged with a crime (including booking, processing and 
detaining suspects), oversee court security, and coordinate prisoner 
transportation.

************************************
In 2014, federal law enforcement 
agencies made 12% fewer arrests 
for a federal offense than in 2013
************************************

In 2014, there were 81,881 arrests for an immigration offense, down from 96,374 
in 2013. Half (50%) of federal arrests involved an immigration offense as the 
most serious arrest offense. Drug offenses and supervision violations (14% each) 
were the next most common offenses in 2014. Nearly 8 in 10 (78%) federal arrests 
in 2014 were for immigration, drug, or supervision violations.

Arrests for violations of federal law decreased 12% from 2013 to 2014 (table 2). 
This represents the largest year-to-year change in arrests since 1994 (figure 2). 
Sixty-four percent of the decline was due to a decrease in immigration offenses, 
16% was due to a decrease in drug arrests, and 8% was due to a decrease in property 
offenses. Sixty-eight percent of the decline between 2013 and 2014 occurred in the 
five southwest border districts. Arrests in each of the five southwest border 
districts declined from 2013 to 2014.

************************************
Nearly two-thirds of federal arrests 
in 2014 were in the five districts 
along the U.S.-Mexico border
************************************

In 2014, there were 100,656 arrests in the five U.S.-Mexico border districts, 
compared to 64,609 in the remaining 89 districts. Texas Southern (33,050) had 
the most arrests, followed by Arizona (31,952) and Texas Western (23,284) (map 1). 
From 2013 to 2014, the number of suspects arrested in U.S.-Mexico border districts 
decreased by 13%, compared to a decrease of 10% in other border districts. In 2014, 
there were 165,265 federal arrests of 155,699 individual suspects (table 3).
***Footnote 2 Analysis of suspects with more than one arrest is based on the 
USMS’s unique identifier (U.S. Marshals Number) for individual suspects.*** 
The gap between the number of arrests and individual suspects was relatively 
consistent from 1994 to 2014 (figure 2).

**********************
Immigration arrests
**********************

There were 81,881 immigration arrests made in 2014
****************************************************

Immigration offenses include illegal entry, illegal reentry, alien smuggling, 
and visa fraud. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has primary law 
enforcement responsibility for immigration offenses, and its law enforcement 
agencies made 99% of the 81,881 immigration arrests in 2014. The U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection (CBP), a DHS agency, was the arresting agency for 68% 
of immigration arrests in 2014, and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
(ICE) was the arresting agency for 30%. Department of Justice (DOJ) law enforcement 
agencies (mostly the USMS) made 1% of immigration arrests in 2014 (not shown).

***********************************************
Immigration arrests doubled from 1994 to 1998, 
doubled again from 1998 to 2006, and doubled 
again from 2006 to 2013
***********************************************

The number of immigration arrests increased at a slightly faster rate than the 
number of individual suspects arrested for an immigration offense (figure 3). 
Starting in 2009, the greater relative increase in arrests (not individual suspects) 
was the result of an increase in the number of multiple arrests per suspect. 
This corresponded with a period of increased federal criminal justice efforts to deter 
illegal entry and reentry along the southwest border by increasing the likelihood 
of apprehension and criminal consequences. Suspects whose most serious offense was 
an immigration offense were also arrested an additional 2,665 times for either 
an immigration or some other offense in 2014.

***************************************************
Most immigration arrests in 2014 were in the five 
districts along the U.S.-Mexico border
***************************************************

Ninety-three percent of federal immigration arrests in 2014 occurred 
in five federal districts along the U.S.-Mexico border (map 2). 
The busiest court city for immigration arrests in 2014 was Tucson, 
Arizona (17,731). Laredo, Texas (15,207), in Texas Southern was 
the second busiest court city for immigration arrests in 2014 (not shown).

Sex offense arrests
********************

**********************************************
Sex offenses were the fastest growing federal 
arrest offense from 2010 to 2014
**********************************************

Federal law enforcement arrested 3,447 sex offense suspects in 2014, 
a 4% increase from 2010. (See Methodology for classification
of sex offenses.) This period was marked by closer 
surveillance of registered sex offenders and more restrictions of sex 
offenders on supervision in the community. The FBI (39%) made the most sex 
offense arrests in 2014, followed by the USMS (29%) and ICE (20%). The number 
of suspects arrested for a sex offense doubled from 1994 to 1998, doubled again 
from 1998 to 2004, and doubled again from 2004 to 2013 (figure 4). From 2010 to 
2014, sex offenses made up 2% (16,842) of the total number of federal arrests 
(882,713) (not shown).

******************************************************
In 2014, arrests for federal sex offenses made up 4% 
of federal, state, and local sex offense arrests
******************************************************

In 2014, there were an estimated 21,007 arrests for rape and 55,456 
arrests for sex offenses (excluding prostitution) reported by state 
and local law enforcement.***Footnote 3 FBI, Crime in the United States, 
2014, table 29.*** A total of 79,910 arrests for sex offenses was comprised 
of 76,463 state and local law enforcement arrests and 3,447 federal arrests. 
Federal arrests accounted for 4% of national sex offense arrests.

Seven districts had 80 or more federal sex offense arrests in 2014 (map 3). 
Florida Middle (131), Texas Western (120), and Arizona (100) had 100 or more 
sex offense arrests. The busiest court cities for federal sex offense arrests 
in 2014 were San Diego, California (62); Phoenix, Arizona (62); Portland, 
Oregon (57); and Springfield, Illinois (54).

****************************************************

***********************************
Enforcement initiatives targeting 
sex offenders 
***********************************

Recent initiatives that have targeted sex offenders include the Department 
of Justice’s (DOJ) Project Safe Childhood, which was initiated in 2006 
to address the expanding use of technology in the sexual exploitation 
of children. 

The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (P.L. 109-248) was passed 
in 2006 and authorized the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) to investigate 
registered sex offenders and assist state, local, tribal, and territorial 
law enforcement with apprehending sex offenders. The USMS established the 
National Sex Offender Targeting Center to improve the tracking and apprehension 
of fugitive sex offenders. In 2008, the Providing Resources, Officers, and 
Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our Children Act of 2008 (PROTECT 
Our Children Act) required the DOJ to create a national strategy to combat 
child exploitation across levels of government and the private sector 
(P.L. 110-401). 
****************************************************

Drug offense arrests
*********************

***********************************************
Drug offenses were the second most common 
arrest offense in 2014
***********************************************

There were 23,703 arrests for drug offenses in 2014, a 13% decrease from 2013. 
Drug arrests declined to their lowest levels since 1996 (figure 5). From 2010 
to 2014, drug offenses (135,789) accounted for 15% of the total number 
of federal arrests (882,713) (not shown).

The DEA (34%) made the most federal drug arrests in 2014, followed by USMS 
(17%), ICE (13%), and the FBI (12%). In 2014, drug offense suspects were 
arrested 731 times for crimes other than drug offenses. Sixty percent of 
nondrug offense arrests were for supervision violation offenses, 28% were 
for immigration, and 6% were for weapons offenses (not shown).

*************************************************************
In 2014, federal drug arrests made up 1% of all federal, state, 
and local drug arrests
*************************************************************

In 2014, a total of 1,584,934 drug arrests were made by law enforcement
*** Footnote 4 FBI, Crime in the United States, 2014, table 29.*** State 
and local law enforcement made 1,561,231 arrests for drug violations in 
2014. Federal law enforcement made 23,703 drug arrests in 2014, or 1% of 
all drug arrests in the United States. Four of the five districts with the 
largest number of federal drug arrests were located along the southwest 
border, including Arizona (3,190), Texas Western (1,639), California 
Southern (1,443), and Texas Southern (1,245) (map 4). The busiest 
court cities for drug arrests in 2014 were Tucson, Arizona (2,897); 
San Diego, California (1,257); and El Paso, Texas (689) (not shown).

*******************************************************************************

******************************
Patterns in DEA drug arrests
******************************

The DEA made 29,549 arrests in 2014
*************************************

Created in 1973, the mission of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) 
is to enforce the controlled substances laws and regulations of the United 
States. This includes investigating major drug offenders at the national 
and international levels. Targeted offenders include organized gangs involved 
in drug trafficking, violent offending, and money laundering. The DEA 
coordinates with foreign governments and federal, state, and local agencies. 
They focus on programs designed to reduce the availability of illicit drugs, 
including methods such as crop eradication, crop substitution, and training 
of foreign officials. The DEA has 221 domestic offices in the United States 
and 86 offices in 67 countries (see http://www.dea.gov/about/mission.shtml).

The DEA reported 29,549 drug arrests in 2014, down from 30,532 in 2013. 
Drug arrests by the DEA increased during the 1990s to a peak of 46,435 arrests 
in 2000, followed by a decline to 29,238 in 2003 (figure 6). DEA data do not 
distinguish between arrests that are referred for either state or federal 
prosecution. The Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys keeps records of the 
agencies that refer matters to federal prosecutors and whether the matters are 
prosecuted in U.S. district court.*** Footnote 5 The unit of count reported in this 
section is an arrest by the DEA where each arrest of an individual suspect is 
counted separately. The unit of count for suspects referred by the DEA to U.S. 
attorneys is an investigation or matter where each investigation of an individual 
is counted separately.***

Suspects in matters referred to U.S. attorneys by the DEA increased from 16,207 
in 1995 to a peak of 20,486 in 2005. From 1995-2014, DEA federal referrals made 
up 54% of DEA arrests. In 2014, 10,063 suspects were referred by the DEA to U.S. 
attorneys and prosecuted in federal court. 

Heroin arrests by the DEA increased at the fastest 
annual average rate from 2002 to 2014
***************************************************

Among specific drug types, heroin arrests (4%) by the DEA increased at the 
fastest annual average rate from 2002 to 2014, followed by methamphetamine 
(1%) (figure 7). During the same period, arrests for crack cocaine declined 
by an annual average of 7% and arrests for cocaine powder declined by 4%.

Cocaine (25%) was the most common drug type 
involved in arrests by the DEA in 2014 
***************************************************

Arrests involving cocaine powder (5,666) and crack cocaine (1,715) accounted 
for a quarter (25%) of all arrests by the DEA in 2014 (table 4). Nineteen 
percent of arrests by the DEA were for offenses involving cocaine powder 
and 6% were for crack cocaine. The remaining arrests by the DEA in 2014 were 
for methamphetamine (24%), marijuana (18%), heroin (16%), and other or nondrug 
offenses (16%). Arrests for methamphetamine and heroin have increased each 
year since 2008. 

Suspects of Hispanic or Latino origin made up 42% 
of DEA arrestees in 2014 
***************************************************

In 2014, Hispanic or Latino (42%) arrestees made up the largest number 
of suspects arrested by the DEA, followed by white (31%) and black (24%) 
suspects. Hispanic suspects made up 57% of arrests for cocaine powder 
offenses, 47% of arrests for methamphetamine, and 45% of arrests 
for heroin offenses.

More than three-quarters (79%) of crack cocaine suspects were black, 
and 44% of methamphetamine suspects were white. White suspects made up 
nearly half (47%) of suspects arrested by the DEA for other drug types 
or nondrug offenses. These include pharmaceutical narcotics such as 
oxycodone, other controlled substances such as LSD, and offenses 
involving drug equipment.

Most DEA arrestees in 2014 were male (81%) and 
age 34 or younger (56%) 
***************************************************

Males accounted for 81% of all DEA arrests in 2014. Twenty-three percent 
of male suspects were arrested for methamphetamine, compared to 21% for 
powder cocaine and 20% for marijuana. Twenty-nine percent of females arrested 
by the DEA for drug violations were arrested for methamphetamine, compared 
to 24% for other drug offenses, 14% for marijuana, and 13% for cocaine powder 
offenses. Females accounted for 19% of all DEA drug arrests and made up 23% 
of all methamphetamine arrests. More than half (56%) of all suspects arrested 
by the DEA were age 34 or younger. The median age was similar across all drug 
types, ranging from ages 32 to 35. Five percent of arrests by the DEA were 
of suspects age 55 or older, and 5% of suspects were age 20 or younger.

In 2014, most females arrested by the DEA were 
white, while most males were Hispanic 
***************************************************

Among females arrested by the DEA in 2014, 47% were white, 31% were Hispanic, 
and 18% were black. Between 1995 and 2014, white females almost always made 
up the greatest share of females arrested by the DEA. The percentage of black 
female arrests by the DEA declined from 29% in 1995 to 18% in 2014 (figure 8). 

In 2014, Hispanics accounted for 43% of males arrested by the DEA. This 
represents a consistent level in the Hispanic share of male arrests since 1995. 
Whites (26%) and blacks (25%) made up a similar percentage of arrests of males 
by the DEA in 2014 (figure 9).
*******************************************************************************

**************************
Weapons offense arrests
**************************

Weapons offenses made up 4% of federal arrests 
in 2014
**************************************************

Federal law enforcement made 6,984 arrests for weapons offenses in 2014, 
an 11% decrease from 2013. Federal law includes multiple provisions that 
regulate unlawful possession or use of firearms or receipt or transfer 
of firearms. The Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) was the 
arresting agency in less than half (48%) of federal weapons arrests in 2014. 
The USMS was the arresting agency in 28% of weapons arrests, and the FBI was 
the arresting agency in 10% of weapons arrests in 2014. Weapons arrests peaked 
in 2004 then declined each year from 2005 to 2011 (figure 10). From 2010 to 2014, 
weapons offenses accounted for 4% (37,922) of the total number of arrests (882,713) 
during this period (not shown). Of the 233 weapons suspects with one or more 
nonweapons arrests in 2014, two-thirds (66%) were arrested for a supervision 
violation and nearly a fifth (18%) were arrested for a drug offense (not shown).

In 2014, federal weapons arrests made up 5% of 
federal, state, and local weapons arrests
**************************************************

In 2014, a total of 147,697 weapons arrests were made by federal, state, 
and local law enforcement. ***Footnote 6 FFBI, Crime in the United States, 
2014, table 29.*** State and local law enforcement made an estimated 140,713 
weapons arrests.Federal law enforcement made 6,984 weapons arrests (5% of all 
weapons arrests). Federal districts with the largest number of weapons arrests 
in 2014 included Puerto Rico (401), Texas Western (225), Texas Southern (224), 
and Missouri Western (221) (map 5). The busiest court city for weapons arrests 
in 2014 was Hato Rey, Puerto Rico (395), followed by Kansas City, Missouri 
(215) (not shown).

Supervision violation arrests
******************************
Supervision violations were the third most 
common arrest offense in 2014
**************************************************

In 2014, there were 22,939 arrests for supervision violations involving 20,202 
individual suspects. From 2013 to 2014, supervision violations decreased by 5%. 
Supervision violations include violations of bail, probation, post-incarceration 
supervision, and failure to appear. The USMS was the arresting agency in 94% of 
supervision violation arrests in 2014. Arrests for supervision violations increased 
by an annual average of 3% from 1994 to 2014 (figure 11). In 2014, a third of federal 
supervision violations occurred in six districts: Texas Southern, Texas Western, Arizona, 
California Southern, New Mexico, and Virginia Eastern (map 6). The busiest court city 
for supervision arrests and bookings in 2014 was Washington, D.C. (1,423), followed 
by San Diego, California (886), and Tucson, Arizona (834) (not shown).

*******************************
Investigation and prosecution
*******************************

Suspects in matters investigated
*********************************

In 2014, U.S attorneys investigated 138,177 
suspects in matters involving 160,505 suspects
**************************************************

Each year from 2010 to 2014, an average of about 180,000 suspects were investigated 
(figure 12). A total of 2,346,026 matters were opened from 1994 to 2014. Matters may 
include multiple suspects. A total of 2,977,837 suspects were investigated from 1994 
to 2014. This was an average of 1.3 suspects per matter.

The majority of suspects in matters investigated 
in 2014 by the U.S. attorneys were referred 
by the DHS
**************************************************

Fourteen years after the reorganization of federal law enforcement agencies under 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002, DHS agencies referred 58% of all suspects 
in matters received by U.S. attorneys in 2014, up from 57% in 2013 (table 5).
***Footnote 7 In this section, each suspect is counted separately in matters 
investigated.*** Law enforcement agencies within the DOJ referred 25% of suspects 
in matters referred to U.S. attorneys in 2014, compared to 26% in 2013, 27% in 2012, 
and 56% in 2001. In 2014, the Department of Treasury made up 2% of all suspects 
in matters referred in 2014, down from 20% in 2001.

*************************************************************************************

**************************************************
U.S. attorneys serve as the chief federal law 
enforcement officers within their respective 
districts
**************************************************

U.S. attorneys serve as chief federal law enforcement officer within their 
respective districts. One U.S. attorney serves both the Guam and Northern 
Mariana Islands districts. ***Footnote 8 This section of the report combines 
Northern Mariana Islands and Guam for statistical reporting.***
Most investigations referred to a U.S. attorney come from a federal 
law enforcement agency. State and local law enforcement agencies are 
also sources of criminal referrals to U.S. attorneys’ offices. U.S. 
attorneys determine which cases they will prosecute and establish policies 
and priorities within their federal judicial districts. They take into account 
a variety of factors, such as the Department of Justice priorities, available 
resources, state and local priorities, and law enforcement priorities. The national 
priorities for U.S. attorneys in 2014 included the disruption and prevention 
of terrorism, violent offenses, civil rights violations, financial fraud, crimes 
against vulnerable victims, hate crimes, and human trafficking 
(see http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/usao/legacy/2014/09/22/13statrpt.pdf).
***************************************************************************************

Two-thirds of suspects in matters referred to 
U.S. attorneys in 2014 were charged with an 
immigration or drug offense as the most 
serious charge
**************************************************

In 2014, there were 160,505 suspects in matters referred to U.S. attorneys 
in 2014 (table 6). Half of suspects in matters referred involved an immigration 
offense as the most serious charge. Seventeen percent involved a drug offense 
as the most serious charge. A total of 414,924 drug matters were opened from 1994 
to 2014 (figure 13). Drug matters may include multiple suspects. A total of 738,397 
suspects were investigated for a drug offense as the primary charge from 1994 to 2014, 
or an average of 1.8 suspects per drug matter.


Overall, suspects in matters referred decreased by an annual average of 4% from 2010 
to 2014. Among suspects in matters referred during this period, public order (7%) and 
property and drug (6%) offenses decreased at the fastest annual rate. 

Weapons offenses decreased by an annual average 
of 4% between 2010 and 2014
**************************************************

Weapons offenses decreased by an annual average of 4%, from 10,616 matters referred 
in 2010 to 8,901 in 2014. A total of 370,350 fraud matters were opened from 1994 to 
2014 (figure 14). Fraud matters may include multiple suspects. A total of 503,844 
suspects were investigated for a fraud offense as the primary charge from 1994 
to 2014, or an average of 1.4 suspects per fraud matter.


In 2014, more than half (55%) of suspects referred 
to U.S. attorneys were in the five southwest 
border districts
**************************************************

Federal prosecutors in the five federal districts along the
U.S.-Mexico border handled matters involving 88,762 suspects in 2014, 
or 55% of all suspects handled nationwide (map 7). Suspects in matters 
referred in these five districts decreased by an annual average of 1% 
from 2010 to 2014. Among nonborder districts, the districts with the most 
referrals included Florida Southern (3,021), California Central (2,420), 
and Virginia Eastern (2,522). Suspects in matters referred to U.S. attorneys 
in nonborder districts decreased from 94,365 matters referred in 2010, 
an annual average decrease of 6%.

*******************************************************************************

******************************************
Role of federal prosecutor in 
charging suspects
******************************************

U.S. attorneys may decline to file charges for reasons such as weak 
or insufficient evidence, minimal federal interest, lack of resources, 
and lack of criminal intent. Matters that are declined may also be referred 
to other authorities for prosecution or be settled through alternative resolution 
procedures. U.S. attorneys may file charges and prosecute defendants in U.S. 
district court or before a U.S. magistrate. U.S. magistrates have the authority 
to adjudicate misdemeanor offenses (18 U.S.C. § 3401). With the exception 
of misdemeanor offenses or when suspects waive their right to a grand jury 
indictment, the U.S. attorney presents evidence to a grand jury. The grand 
jury deliberates and decides whether the suspect should be indicted for 
committing a crime. If the grand jury returns an indictment, the U.S. 
attorney may file criminal charges in U.S. district court.
********************************************************************************

The number of suspects in matters referred 
to U.S. attorneys varied by offense type
******************************************

The number of suspects involved in matters varied by type of offense. 
Nearly all immigration (99%) and sex offense (97%) matters involved 
a single suspect (table 7). About 28% drug matters involved more than 
one suspect, while 5% involved five or more suspects. Most investigations 
with more than one suspect involved two suspects. Drug (14%), fraud (11%), 
and regulatory offenses (8%) had the greatest share of matters with two suspects. 
A total of 13,644 fraud matters were referred to U.S. attorneys’ offices in 2014. 
Two percent involved five or more suspects, and 16% involved two 
to four co-suspects.

********************************
Suspects in matters concluded
********************************

46% of suspects in matters concluded 
in 2014 were prosecuted by U.S. attorneys
******************************************

Suspects charged with weapons (72%) and drug (71%) offenses had the highest 
prosecution rates in 2014, followed by sex (64%), violent (60%), property (52%), 
and public order (42%) offenses (table 8).

4 in 10 matters concluded in 2014 were 
disposed by U.S. magistrates
******************************************

U.S. magistrates have the authority to adjudicate misdemeanor offenses 
(18 U.S.C. § 3401). Thirty-eight percent of matters concluded by U.S. 
attorneys in 2014 were disposed by U.S. magistrates. Offenses that were most 
likely to be disposed by U.S. magistrates included immigration (69%), other 
public order (19%), and other property (18%) offenses. Other public order offenses 
include an array of offenses, such as tax law violations, bribery, perjury, 
national defense, racketeering, and extortion (see Methodology).

In the five U.S.-Mexico border districts, nearly two-thirds (65%) of matters 
concluded by U.S. attorneys were disposed by U.S. magistrates, compared to less 
than a tenth (6%) of matters in other districts. This was the result of immigration 
enforcement along the southwest border. Generally, first-time illegal entry defendants 
who agreed to plead guilty to a petty misdemeanor charge were sentenced to 30 days 
or less of confinement by U.S. magistrate and were subsequently removed from the 
United States upon completion of the sentence.

Seventeen percent of matters were declined for prosecution in 2014. Suspects 
involved in regulatory offenses were most likely to be declined for prosecution 
(49%), followed by fraud (42%), other public order (38%), and sex (35%) offenses.

Six law enforcement agencies referred more 
than three-quarters of all matters 
concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2014
******************************************

Eighty-six percent (145,647) of the 170,161 matters concluded by U.S. attorneys 
in 2014 were referred by six federal law enforcement agencies. CBP referred the 
largest number of suspects (58,127 matters), followed by the FBI (20,265) and 
Citizenship and Immigration Services (17,523). The other three agencies included 
ICE (17,064), the DEA (12,375), and ATF (8,214). Among these six agencies, the 
highest prosecution rates in 2014 for matters referred by ICE (81%), the DEA 
(73%), and ATF (72%) (table 9). Twenty-nine percent of suspects referred by 
CBP were prosecuted in U.S. district courts, 71% were disposed by U.S. magistrate, 
and fewer than 1% were declined. The prosecution rate for suspects referred by the 
FBI was 56%. Forty-one percent of suspects referred by the FBI were declined, and 
3% were disposed by U.S. magistrate. These six agencies differed in the time from 
receipt of the matter to the decision to prosecute. The FBI had a median time of 
57 days, compared to 22 to 29 days for the other five agencies.

*************************
Case processing time
*************************

Prosecutorial decisions involve whether to prosecute, refer to U.S. magistrate, 
or decline a matter. The time it took U.S. attorneys to decide how they would 
handle a matter varied with the decision made and the charges involved. Matters 
that were declined for prosecution in 2014 took a median 503 days to conclude. 
In 2014, the decision to prosecute a matter in a district court took U.S. attorneys 
a median of 24 days. In comparison, most matters disposed by a U.S. magistrate 
in 2014 were disposed on the same day they were opened.

Among those matters that were declined in 2014, fraud (677 days) and drug (511 days) 
matters took the longest time to reach the declination decision. Matters that were 
declined in 2014 in U.S.-Mexico border districts (518 days) took a similar time 
to process than in other districts. The median case processing time varied by type 
of offense, with fraud (328 days) and regulatory (233 days) offenses taking the longest 
to reach a prosecutorial decision. The median case processing time for immigration 
(0 days) and drug (30 days) offenses took the shortest time to reach a decision 
by the federal prosecutor’s office.

The median time for matters sent to the district court remained relatively stable 
from 1994 to 2014, declining slightly from 26 to 24 days during the 21-year period 
(figure 15). The median time for matters sent to a magistrate increased from 28 days 
in 1994 to 63 days in 2003, and then dropped sharply to a median of 0 days 
for each year from 2008 to 2014. 

The overall median time dropped in part because of a steady decrease in the number 
of matters declined and an increase in the number of immigration matters handled 
by U.S. magistrate beginning in 2005 (not shown). Operation Streamline, a federal 
zero-tolerance prosecutorial initiative, began in the Border Patrol’s Del Rio Sector 
(located in Texas Western) in December 2005. Under Operation Streamline, offenders 
caught making their first illegal entry are charged with a misdemeanor and face up 
to 6 months in prison before being deported. Versions of this approach have been 
expanded and implemented in Arizona (Tucson and Yuma), Texas Southern (Laredo, 
Brownsville, and McAllen), and New Mexico (Las Cruces). El Paso in Texas Western 
also has a Streamline-type program.

**********************
Pretrial detention
*********************

******************************************
Type of offense for persons detained
******************************************

Immigration defendants were most likely 
to be detained prior to case disposition
******************************************

More than 3 in 4 defendants (78%) in cases terminated in 2014 had been detained 
by the court prior to case disposition (table 10). Two-thirds (67%) of defendants 
had been detained for the entire pretrial period and about a tenth (12%) were detained 
for part of the period and released. The defendants most likely to be detained were 
those charged with immigration (89%), weapons (87%), drug (85%), and violent (83%) 
offenses as the most serious charge. The most serious charge is determined by the 
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts as the offense with greatest maximum statutory 
penalty. Immigration defendants made up 41% of all defendants in cases terminated in 2014 
and 47% of all defendants detained prior to case disposition. Eighty-seven percent 
of immigration defendants were detained for the entire period, while 2% of immigrant 
defendants were detained for part of the pretrial period and then released. Eleven 
percent of immigration defendants were not detained prior to case disposition in 2014.

Of the 36% of property defendants detained, the majority were more likely to be 
detained for part of the period—rather than the entire period—than defendants charged 
with other offenses. For cases terminated in 2014, 81% of defendants charged with a sex 
offense were detained prior to case disposition. More than half (59%) of sex offenders 
were detained for the entire pretrial period, and nearly a quarter (22%) were detained 
for part of the period.

********************************
Prior convictions of detainees
********************************

Eighty-six percent of defendants with five or more prior convictions were detained 
in cases terminated in 2014, compared to 71% with no prior convictions. The likelihood 
of being detained also increased with the severity of the defendant’s criminal history. 
Eighty-nine percent of defendants with a prior violent felony conviction were detained, 
compared to defendants with a prior drug felony (86%). Defendants with a prior felony 
(other than violent or drug-related) were detained at the same rate (80%) as defendants 
with only prior misdemeanor convictions. Defendants with a prior misdemeanor conviction 
only (13%) were more likely to be detained for part of the pretrial period. 

Eighty-eight percent of defendants charged in the southwest border districts were 
detained prior to case disposition in 2014, compared to 69% for nonsouthwest border districts. 
The pretrial detention rate for defendants in cases disposed in a southwest border district 
ranged from 67% in California Southern and 95% in Arizona to 98% in New Mexico.

Adjudication
****************

*******************************************
Defendants in cases filed in federal court
*******************************************

There were 80,051 defendants in 61,977
cases filed in 2014
******************************************

For the 21-year period from 1994 to 2014, a total of 1,346,811 criminal cases were filed 
in U.S. district court involving 1,780,173 defendants. This was an average of 1.3 
defendants per case filed. The number of cases filed declined from 78,825 in 2011 
to 61,977 in 2014, and the number of defendants in cases filed decreased from 103,021 
in 2011 to 80,051 in 2014 (figure 16).

Immigration offenses increased from 2,453 cases filed in U.S. district court in 1994 
to a peak of 29,016 cases filed in 2010 (figure 17). In 2014, 21,789 immigration cases 
were filed. Drug offenses increased from 21,871 cases filed in 1994 to 32,897 in 2003 
before declining to 29,493 in 2010. There were 25,595 drug cases filed in 2014. Weapons 
offenses increased from 3,557 cases filed in 1994 to a peak of 10,278 in 2004. Since 2004, 
weapons cases filed in U.S. district court declined to pre-2001 levels (6,288) by 2014.
***Footnote 9 The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts’ criminal master file provides 
one record per defendant in a case, allowing for identification of multiple defendants 
per case. A defendant may be counted multiple times if involved in more than one case.***

During 2014, 80,051 defendants were charged in federal court with a criminal offense, 
89% of whom were charged with felonies (table 11). Of the 71,483 defendants charged 
with felonies in 2014, 32% were charged for drug, 30% for immigration, 16% for property, 
and 3% for violent offenses. The number of defendants charged with a felony sex offense 
increased by an annual average of 10% from 2012 to 2014.


In 2014, drug cases were more likely 
to have multiple defendants than other 
offense types
******************************************

Overall, 12% of all cases filed in U.S. district court in 2014 had multiple defendants 
(table 12). The percentage varied greatly by offense. For example, 28% of all drug cases 
filed in U.S. district court in 2014 had more than one defendant and 6% had 5 or more 
defendants. In comparison, 3% of cases involving an immigration or sex offense 
had multiple defendants.

***********************************
Demographic characteristics 
of defendants charged
***********************************

2 in 5 defendants charged in U.S. 
district court in 2014 were 
non-U.S. citizens
******************************************

Forty-two percent of defendants charged in U.S. district courts in 2014 were 
non-U.S. citizens. Noncitizens charged included persons with legal (5%) status 
(permanent residents, persons in possession of a green card, persons with a valid 
temporary visa, and persons with refugee status) and persons in the country without 
legal authorization (37%). Of the 42% of defendants who were noncitizens, 32% were 
from Mexico, 5% were from Central America, 2% were from the Caribbean, and 1% were 
from South America. Noncitizens from Asia and Oceania, Europe, and Africa together 
represented 2% of defendants charged in U.S. district court (table 13).


The majority (55%) of defendants charged 
in U.S. district courts in 2014 were 
of Hispanic origin
******************************************

Defendants of Hispanic origin made up more than half of defendants charged 
in U.S. district court. Two-thirds (65%) of defendants charged were between 
ages 25 and 44. Defendants age 50 or older made up 14% of defendants charged. 
The youngest (age 19 or younger) and oldest defendants (age 65 or older) 
together made up 3% of defendants charged in 2014.

Males (85%) made up most of defendants 
charged in U.S. district court in 2014
******************************************

Fifteen percent of defendants charged in federal court in 2014 were female. Most 
females charged were of Hispanic origin (40%), followed by white (33%) and black 
or African American (22%). The male racial profile had a similar ordering. Most males 
charged were of Hispanic origin (57%), followed by white (21%) and black or African 
American (19%). The median age for females (age 36) was similar to males (age 35). 
Females charged were mostly U.S. citizens (80%), with 6% having legal alien status 
and 14% having illegal alien status. Males charged were more evenly split between 
U.S. (55%) and non-U.S. citizens (45%). Among males, the most common countries of 
nationality apart from the United States included Mexico (35%), Central America (6%), 
the Caribbean (2%), and South America (1%). Among females, the most common countries 
of nationality apart from the United States were similar to that of males. They included 
Mexico (13%), Central America (2%), the Caribbean (2%), and South America (1%).

Mexican nationals made up a declining 
number of noncitizens charged in 
U.S. district court from 2012 to 2014 
******************************************

In 2014, defendants with Mexican citizenship who were charged in U.S. district 
court decreased from 25,134 in 2012 to 20,139 in 2014. Central American defendants 
charged in federal court decreased modestly, from 3,481 defendants in 2012 to 3,188 
defendants in 2014. Defendants from South America decreased from 763 in 2012 to 675 
in 2014 (figure 18).

************************************
Defendants in cases terminated
************************************

9 in 10 defendants adjudicated in 
U.S. district court in 2014 were convicted
**********************************************

Of the 85,781 defendants adjudicated in 2014, 91% were convicted (table 14). More 
than 90% of all defendants charged with immigration (97%), sex (94%), weapons (93%), 
drug (93%), and violent (92%) offenses were convicted. In 2014, 89% of adjudicated 
defendants were convicted following a guilty plea. Three percent of defendants were 
adjudicated through a bench or jury trial. Adjudicated defendants charged with violent 
(7%) or regulatory (7%) offense had the highest percentage of trials in 2014.

9% of adjudicated defendants were 
dismissed in 2014
**************************************

Misdemeanants had the highest percentage of dismissals (28%), followed by defendants 
charged with regulatory (11%) and other property (9%) offenses. In 2014, defendants 
adjudicated in the southwest border districts had a higher conviction rate (96%) than 
defendants in nonborder districts (89%). In 2014, dismissals (304 days), acquittals 
(304 days), and guilty pleas (212 days) took less time to process from case filing 
to disposition than trials ending in conviction (516 days).

***********************
Case processing time
***********************

In 2014, a felony case took a median of 214 
days to process from filing to disposition
**********************************************

The median case processing time for felonies from case filing to disposition increased 
from 197 days in 1994 to 242 days in 2014 (figure 19). Guilty pleas made up 89% of the 
case outcomes, which influenced the overall median case processing time. The median case 
processing time of felony cases terminated by a guilty plea increased from 184 days 
in 1994 to 214 days in 2014.

Time to terminate a case by a bench or jury 
trial decision increased from 1994 to 2014
**********************************************

In 2014, felony cases terminated by a trial took a median of 488 days, a 78% increase 
from 274 days in 1994. Cases terminated by dismissal took a median of 334 days in 2014, 
up 50% from 223 days in 1994. The number of defendants who were found guilty following 
a trial declined by an annual average of 5% from 2010 to 2014, and the number of defendants 
who were found not guilty at trial decreased by 4% during this period. The number of guilty 
pleas decreased by an average annual rate of 3% from 2010 to 2014, while case dismissals 
decreased by 3% (table 15).

***********************************************************************************************

**********************************************
The use of public defenders and appointed 
counsel increased with the growth in the 
federal criminal caseload 
**********************************************

The Criminal Justice Act (CJA) was enacted in 1964 (Title 18 U.S.C. § 3006A) and requires 
that attorneys be appointed to represent defendants unable to pay for their own counsel. 
The Defender Services Division of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC) 
oversees expenditures for federal defendants through two types of programs. The first type 
of program comprises panel attorneys who are appointed case-by-case by the court from a list 
of private attorneys. The second type draws from federal defender organizations, which can take 
one of two forms: federal public defender organizations staffed with federal government employees 
and headed by a public defender appointed by the court of appeals, or community defender 
organizations that are incorporated, nonprofit legal service organizations that receive grants 
from the AOUSC. At the end of their cases, more than three-quarters (78%) of federal defendants 
in 2014 were represented by public defenders or assigned counsel, up from more than half (54%) 
in 1994.*** Footnote 10 In this report, the type of counsel for federal defendants was the type 
at case termination. Other counsel may have represented the defendant earlier. Data describing 
counsel at filing or initiation were not used because they were incomplete or unavailable.***

For cases concluding in 2014, most defendants 
had some type of counsel
**********************************************

Almost all (97%) of the more than 85,781 defendants in cases concluded in 2014 had some 
type of counsel, either hired or appointed. The remaining defendants (3%) waived 
representation or were self-represented in cases that were mostly misdemeanors. 

In 2014, public defenders represented 38% of defendants (up from 21% in 1994), 
panel-appointed attorneys represented 39% (up from 30% in 1994), and private 
attorneys represented 19% of defendants (down from 35% in 1994). From 1994 
to 2014, the use of public defenders increased at an annual average rate 
of 5%, and the use of CJA attorneys increased at an annual average rate 
of 3%. Use of private attorneys decreased by an average of 1% from 1994 
to 2014, and defendants waiving counsel or representing themselves 
decreased annually by 3% (figure 20).

Growth in immigration cases increased public 
defender and panel-appointed attorney caseloads
**************************************************

In 2014, defendants charged with immigration offenses made up the largest share 
of cases terminated with a public defender (43%), followed by drug offenses (15%) 
(table 16). Drug offenses (41%) made up the largest share of cases terminated with 
CJA attorneys, followed by immigration offenses (21%). Drug (35%) and property 
(26%) offense cases made up more than half of private counsel caseloads. 
Nearly all (97%) defendants that waived counsel were charged with misdemeanors.

In 2014, about 42% of cases terminated with 
a public defender were in the five federal 
judicial districts along the U.S.-Mexico border
**************************************************

Forty-two percent of cases terminated with a public defender in 2014 were in the 
U.S.-Mexico border districts. About 39% of cases terminated with a CJA attorney 
were also in the U.S.-Mexico border districts; most were in Arizona (15%). Eighteen 
percent of cases terminated with a private attorney were in the U.S.-Mexico border 
districts. The median days from filing to case termination was longest for cases 
involving private attorneys (304 days), followed by CJA attorneys (244 days). 
Cases handled by public defenders (153 days) had the shortest median case 
processing time in part due to the greater share of immigration cases, 
which were processed more quickly.
***********************************************************************************

***************
Sentencing
***************

******************
Type of sentence
******************

3 in 4 convicted defendants were sentenced to
prison in 2014
**************************************************

Of the 78,155 defendants convicted in U.S. district court in 2014, more than 
three-quarters (78%) were sentenced to prison. This proportion was unchanged 
from 2010. In comparison, about a third (65%) of convicted defendants received 
a prison sentence in 1994. The number of persons who were sentenced to prison 
decreased from 69,494 in 2010 to 60,626 in both 2013 and 2014.

1 in 10 convicted defendants in 2014 were 
sentenced to a term of probation
**************************************************

The number of persons sentenced to probation decreased an annual average 
of 16%, from 9,627 in 2010 to 8,275 in 2014. In 2014, 2% of defendants were 
ordered to pay a fine only. Persons receiving a fine-only sentence decreased 
from 2,758 in 2010 to 1,758 in 2014. In 2014, 9% of all convicted defendants 
received a suspended sentence, up from 8% of convicted defendants sentenced 
in 2010 (not shown).

***************
Prison terms
***************

Median prison terms increased slightly from 
30 months in 2010 to 33 months in 2014
**************************************************

The median prison sentence for federal offenders increased from 30 months 
in 2010 to 33 months in 2014 (table 17). Drug offenders received a median 
prison sentence of 60 months in 2014, which was unchanged from 2010. Violent 
offenders received a median of 60 months in prison in 2014, down from 63 months 
in 2010. Weapons offenders received a median sentence of 57 months in 2014, down 
from 60 months in 2010. The median prison sentence was the same in 2010 and 2014 
for immigration offenders (15 months). Defendants convicted and sentenced to prison 
in 2014 in the five southwest border districts received a median sentence of 18 months, 
compared to a median of 48 months in other districts. This was largely the result 
of the relatively higher percentage of immigration cases in the southwest districts.

*************************
Sex offender sentences
*************************

Median prison sentences for defendants convicted of sex offenses had the greatest 
increase from 1994 to 2014 The median prison sentence imposed on defendants convicted 
for a felony sex offense increased an annual average of 5%, from 36 months in 1994 
to 90 months in 2014 (figure 21). In comparison, the median prison term imposed for 
weapons (57 months) and drug offenses (60 months) remained stable during this period. 
The median prison term imposed for immigration offenses decreased from 24 months 
in 1994 to 15 months in 2014.

Defendants convicted of sex offenses were 
most likely to receive a prison sentence
**************************************************

In 2014, sex offense convictions (96%) were the most likely to receive a prison sentence, 
followed by violent (93%), weapons (92%), and drug (89%) offense convictions. 
Seventy-nine percent of convicted immigration offenders were sentenced to prison 
in 2014, down from 82% in 2010. Defendants convicted of other property offenses (52%) 
and regulatory public order offenses (57%) were least likely to receive a prison sentence. 
Defendants convicted in one of the five southwest border districts (84%) were more 
likely to receive a prison sentence as defendants in all other districts (75%).

Offenders under federal post-conviction 
supervision
******************************************

130,409 offenders were under active federal 
post-conviction supervision at fiscal 
yearend 2014
**********************************************

Eighty-five percent of offenders under federal post-conviction supervision 
in 2014 received one of two forms of supervision following release from 
prison: supervised release (109,287) or parole (1,368) (table 19). 
The remainder (19,754) were on probation supervision, which is a sentence 
to a term of supervision in the community with and without a subsequent 
confinement sentence. Among the 130,409 offenders under federal supervision 
at the end of fiscal year 2014, 82% were male and 18% were female. Females 
made up 15% of offenders under supervised release, 37% of offenders on 
probation, and 3% of offenders on parole supervision.

White and black offenders made up the 
largest number of offenders on federal 
supervision
**********************************************

White and black (36% each) offenders made up nearly three in four 
persons on post-conviction federal supervision on September 30, 2014.

White offenders made up nearly half (47%) of offenders on probation. 
Black offenders made up 37% of offenders on supervised release. 
Asians made up 3% of persons on supervised release and 4% of persons 
on probation. Native Americans made up 2% of persons on supervised 
release and 3% of persons on probation.

The median age was similar for offenders on supervised release 
(40 years old) or on probation (41 years old) and higher 
(54 years old) for persons on parole supervision. Seven percent 
of persons under federal post-conviction supervised release in the 
community in 2014 were non-U.S. citizens.

Drug offenses made up a growing share of offenses committed by offenders 
under federal supervision, from 44% in 2004 to 48% in 2014 (figure 23). 
The percentage of fraud offenders under supervision decreased from 23% 
in 2004 to 17% in 2014. Weapons offenders under federal supervision 
increased from 7% in 2004 to 12% in 2014.

**************************************************************************

*************************************
Supervising federal offenders 
in the community
*************************************

The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts oversees the supervision 
of federal offenders in the community. This includes persons released 
prior to trial and persons on supervision following conviction. 
U.S. probation and pretrial offices are located in 93 of the 94 
federal judicial districts. Federal pretrial and probation officers 
monitor the compliance of offenders placed on supervision conditions 
ordered by the court. Violations include commission of a new federal, 
state, or local offense or violation of conditions of supervision. 
Examples of violations include prohibited possession of guns or other 
weapons, possession or use of illegal drugs, and contact with victims 
or witnesses. The court may order additional conditions depending 
on the offense and the offender, such as requiring that a person 
in the United States illegally be subject to deportation as a condition 
of release of supervision.

*************************************
Offenders returning to federal 
prison from 1998 to 2014
*************************************
 
15% of offenders released from federal prison 
in 2012 returned to federal prison within 
3 years of release
**********************************************

This section describes offenders returning to federal prison within 3 years 
of release.In 2012, 66,620 offenders were released from federal prison.
 Of those offenders, 15% (10,236) returned to federal prison within 3 years 
(figure 24). The proportion of offenders returning to federal prison within 
3 years decreased from 18% of those released during 1998 to 15% of those 
released during 2012.

Return-to-prison rates were highest 
for younger released offenders
**********************************************

Offenders age 17 or younger (33%) and those ages 18 to 24 (22%) who were released 
in 2012 had the highest 3-year return-to-prison rates (figure 25). Of these returns, 
50% were for a supervision violation and 48% were for a new court commitment. Among 
released prisoners ages 25 to 34, 18% returned to prison within 3 years, as did 14% 
of prisoners ages 35 to 44, 12% of prisoners ages 45 to 54, and 7% of prisoners ages 
55 to 64. Four percent of released prisoners age 65 or older returned to prison 
within 3 years.

Supervision violations was the most common 
reason for return to prison within 3 years
**********************************************

A violation of conditions of supervision (50%) was the most common reason for 
federal prisoners released in 2012 to return to federal prison within 3 years, 
followed by returns for a new court commitment or new offense (46%) (table 20). 
Among males released in 2012 and returned to federal prison, 48% were for violations 
of supervision and 48% were for a new court commitment. In comparison, 76% of 
females returned to prison for supervision violations and 22% returned with 
a new court commitment. Males released in 2012 had a higher 3-year recidivism 
rate than females. Within 3 years of release, 16% of males had returned to prison, 
compared to 9% of females.

American Indian or Alaska Native prisoners 
had the highest 3-year return-to-prison 
rate among all racial and ethnic groups
**********************************************

Thirty-six percent of American Indian or Alaska Natives first released 
from federal prison in 2012 returned to federal prison within 3 years. 
Eighty-six percent of American Indians returned for a violation of supervision, 
and 14% were returned for a new court commitment. Asians released from federal 
prison in 2012 had the lowest rate of return within 3 years (6%). Ninety-five 
percent of Asians returned for a violation of supervision, and 4% were returned 
for a new court commitment. Black prisoners had the second highest 3-year 
return-to-prison rate (19%), with 72% returned for supervision violations 
and 12% returned for a new court commitment. Whites had a 14% return rate,
with 82% returned for supervision violations and 17% returned for a new court 
commitment. Hispanics had a 14% return rate with 23% returned for supervision 
violations and 76% returned for a new court commitment.

17% of U.S. citizens and 13% of non-U.S. 
citizens released in 2012 returned to 
federal prison within 3 years
**********************************************

Non-U.S. citizens (13%) had a lower 3-year return-to-prison rate than U.S. 
citizens (17%). The lower risk of return for non-U.S. citizens may have 
been a function of differences in how non-U.S. citizen offenders were handled 
following release. Most non-U.S. citizens were deported immediately after serving 
a federal prison term, while a small share of noncitizens were released to serve 
terms of federal supervision. About 9 in 10 noncitizens who returned to prison 
in a 3-year period following release were recommitted for a new court 
commitment, and 1 in 10 were returned for a supervision violation.

Violent and weapons offenders returned to 
prison at higher rates than other offenders
**********************************************

The 3-year return-to-prison rate was highest for violent (28%) and weapons 
(27%) offenders (table 21). Violent (82%) and weapons (84%) offenders were 
most likely to be returned for supervision violations. Immigration offenders 
were most likely to be returned for a new offense (86%). Because most 
immigrations offenders are deported after serving a federal sentence, 
most are returned to prison for illegally reentering the United States.

Immigration offenders made up the largest 
group of recidivists
**********************************************

Seventeen percent of immigration offenders released in 2012 were returned 
to federal prison within 3 years of release, representing 40% of all 
recidivists. In comparison, 27% of recidivists were drug offenders and 
5% were violent offenders during the same period. Immigration offenders 
had the highest percentage of new offenses as a reason for returning 
to federal prison (86%). Fifteen percent of immigration offenders were 
returned for supervision violations.

Immigration was the most common offense type among all returns for new 
offenses. Property (11%) and drug (12%) offenses had the lowest 3-year 
return-to-prison rate. Twenty-six percent of drug offenders released 
in 2012 were returned for a new offense, 60% were returned for a supervision 
violation, and 14% were returned for other reasons. Nineteen percent 
of property offenders were returned for a new offense, and 81% were returned 
for a supervision violation.

Districts with the highest 3-year 
return-to-prison rate for new court
commitments only were clustered in the 
southwestern United States
**********************************************

The districts of Arizona (17%), Texas Southern (16%), and California 
Southern (13%) had the highest 3-year return-to-prison rates for a 
new court commitment among 2012 releasees (map 9). Both the release and 
return offenses in these districts were primarily for immigration. Among 
2012 releasees, six districts had 3-year return-to-prison rates of 18% 
or more for supervision violations (map 10). Two of these districts were 
adjacent to one another: Montana (28%) and North Dakota (21%). These two 
districts also had the highest rates of return to federal prison.

Methodology
************

Background of the Federal Justice 
Statistics Program
********************************************

This report uses data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) 
Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP). The FJSP was initiated 
in 1982 to serve as a central resource for information describing 
the case processing of federal criminal defendants and to meet BJS’s 
statutory mandate to “collect, analyze, and disseminate comprehensive 
federal justice transaction statistics … and to provide technical assistance 
to and work jointly with other federal agencies to improve the availability 
and quality of federal justice data”—42 U.S.C. 3732 (c) (15).


The FJSP receives administrative data files from six federal criminal 
justice agencies and standardizes this information to maximize comparability 
across agencies and within agencies over time. This includes--

* applying, where possible, person-case as the primary unit of count 
(exceptions include at arrest where the unit of count is the individual 
suspect, at sentencing under federal sentencing guidelines where the unit 
of count is the sentencing event, and at imprisonment where the unit 
of count is the inmate)

* delineating fiscal year (October 1 through September 30) as the 
period for reported events

* applying a uniform offense classification across agencies

* classifying disposition and sentences imposed.

Where more than one offense is charged or adjudicated, the most serious 
offense at disposition and sentencing is used. Offense seriousness 
is based on maximum statutory imprisonment term, type of crime, and 
statutory maximum fine amount. Annual, cross-sectional data files are produced 
and maintained. They represent the federal criminal case processing stages 
from arrest and prosecution through pretrial release, adjudication, sentencing, 
appeals, and corrections.


******************
FJSP data sources
******************

U.S. Marshals Service (USMS): The Justice Detainee Information System (JDIS) 
provides information on suspects arrested for federal offenses. Suspects may 
be counted more than once in a fiscal year if they are arrested multiple times 
during the period. The USMS uses the Prisoner Tracking System to track federal 
prisoners in custody of the Marshals Service and provides data from the JDIS. 
The JDIS consolidates information on prisoners who are in Marshals Service 
custody or who have a federal arrest warrant issued.

Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys: The National LIONS (Legal Information Office 
Network System) database contains information on the investigation and prosecution 
of suspects in criminal matters received and concluded and criminal cases filed and 
terminated by U.S. attorneys. Suspects may be counted more than once in a fiscal year 
if they are involved in multiple matters received and concluded during the period. 
A matter is defined as a referral where an attorney spends one hour or more 
investigating. The lead charge is used to classify the most serious offense 
at referral and is defined as the substantive statute that is the primary 
basis of referral.

Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC): The criminal master file contains 
information about the criminal proceedings against defendants whose cases were filed 
and terminated in U.S. district courts. These data include information on cases 
involving felonies and Class A and B misdemeanors handled by U.S. district court 
judges. Offenses in the Probation and Pretrial Services Automated Case Tracking 
System (PACTS) database are based on the most serious charged offense, as determined 
by the probation officer responsible for interviewing the defendant. The probation 
officer classifies the major offense charged into AOUSC four-digit offense codes. 
For defendants charged with more than one offense on an indictment, the probation 
officer chooses as the major charged offense the one carrying the most severe penalty 
or, in the case of two or more charges carrying the same penalty, the one with the 
highest offense severity. The offense severity level is determined by the AOUSC, 
which ranks offenses according to the maximum sentence, type of crime, and maximum 
fine amount. These four-digit codes are then aggregated into the primary offense charges 
used for this report. This report also uses AOUSC data from the PACTS, which contains 
information on defendants interviewed and supervised by pretrial services. These data 
are used to describe background characteristics of defendants arraigned and defendants 
detained prior to case disposition. Post-conviction data from the AOUSC’s Federal 
Probation Supervision Information System are used to describe immigration offenders 
under post-conviction supervision in the community.

Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP): The SENTRY database contains information on all 
federally sentenced offenders admitted into or released from federal prison during 
a fiscal year and offenders in federal prison at the end of each fiscal year 
(September 30). The inmate count reported by the FJSP differs from what is reported 
by the BOP although the data are from the same source (SENTRY). For example, the BOP 
reports 214,149 inmates as of September 30, 2014. ***Footnote 11 See
www.bop.gov/about/statistics/population_statistics.jsp.*** The FJSP starts with data 
extracted from SENTRY that differs slightly (down 300) from this total (213,849). 
Of the 213,849 records, 16,046 records were dropped because the inmate was not 
designated at an assigned BOP custodial facility. The excluded records include 
designations to community confinement, home confinement, hospital, Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement detention, material witness, and pre-sentence admission. 
Next, 662 were excluded due to missing obligation offense and 5,096 inmates were 
dropped as they were committed by the District of Columbia District Court. Finally, 
549 inmate records were dropped because the inmate was a state boarder, treaty 
transfer, or serving a sentence from a military court commitment. Of the 
213,849 inmates reported by the BOP in custody on September 30, 2014, 196,496 
(90% of the total population) met the criteria as federally sentenced inmates 
(figure 26). 

***************************
Returns to federal prison
***************************

Tracking recidivism rates involved identifying prisoners released from federal 
prison following a U.S. district court commitment between 1998 and 2014. 
The BOP’s SENTRY database was searched and identified a subsequent return to 
federal prison. Prisoners released in 2012 were the most recent cohort that 
could be tracked for 3 years following release (through September 30, 2015). 
In addition, observation windows were included for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year 
return rates following first release. The return-to-prison rate increases with 
the length of the window used to follow up on prisoners. The unit of analysis 
is the first release from federal prison and the return rates are computed using 
the number of first releases. In 2012, there were 66,620 federally sentenced 
prisoners released from the BOP. This cohort of offenders was tracked for 3 
years following release to count the number who returned to federal prison, 
whether for a new offense or a violation of supervision.

Classification of sex offenses
Sex offenses include all violent and nonviolent sex offenses. Violent sex offenses, 
either completed or attempted, include aggravated sexual abuse (18 USC 2241) and 
sexual abuse (18 USC 2242), defined as causing a person to engage in a sexual act 
by use of force, threat or fear or with a person who is unconscious, impaired due 
to drugs, intoxicants or other substances, or is otherwise incapable of declining 
participation); sexual abuse of a minor or ward (18 USC 2243); and abusive sexual 
contact (18 USC 2244), in which the person knowingly engages in or causes sexual 
contact with or by another person without that person’s permission or with a person 
under age 12. Nonviolent sex offenses include sexual exploitation of children and 
child pornography (18 USC 2251-2252A); coercing, enticing or transporting (interstate) 
of an individual (including minors) with the intent and purpose of engaging in 
prostitution or any sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a 
criminal offense (18 USC 2422); and possession with intent to sell or sales and 
distribution of obscene materials (18 USC 1460-1470). See the National Archive 
of Criminal Justice Data for a detailed crosswalk for codes used by U.S. Marshals, 
AOUSC, EOUSA, USSC, and BOP.
