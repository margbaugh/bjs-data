**********************************************************
In 2011, U.S. households experienced about 3,394,700 burglary victimizations, 
a decline from 6,353,700 in 1994. The rate of burglary (attempted forcible 
entry, completed forcible entry, and completed unlawful entry) decreased 56% 
from 1994 to 2011, from 63.4 to 27.6 victimizations per 1,000 U.S. households 
(figure 1). Although declines in the rate of completed burglary were 
consistent across most characteristics of U.S. households, the greatest 
declines occurred among households in urban areas (down 63%), those headed by 
Hispanics (down 67%), and those with an income of $75,000 or more (down 74%). 
From 1994 to 2011, the largest proportion of burglaries involved completed 
unlawful entries, in which someone with no legal right to be in the residence 
entered without use of force. (See Measuring burglary in the NCVS on page 3 
for additional definitions of burglary.)

Highlights
*************

* The rate of household burglary decreased 56% from 1994 to 2011, from a peak 
of 63.4 victimizations per 1,000 U.S. households in 1994 to 27.6 
victimizations per 1,000 households in 2011.

* From 1994 to 2011, the rate of completed burglary decreased by at least 
half across households headed by persons of all races and Hispanic origin.

* Among all completed burglaries, those involving the theft of an electronic 
device or household appliance increased from 28% in 2001 to 34% in 2011.

* In 2011, 58% of completed burglaries were reported to police, compared to 
51% in 1994.

* Among completed burglaries reported to police, a similar percentage 
resulted in an arrest in 1994 (8%) and 2011 (10%).

* From 1994 to 2011, the median dollar value of items and cash stolen during 
completed burglaries increased 54%, from $389 to $600 per year.

* In 2011, 35% of burglarized households that lost $1,000 or more reported 
the victimization to an insurance company, while less than 5% of burglarized 
households that lost $1 to $499 reported the crime to insurance. 

* From 1994 to 2011, households with an income of $14,999 or less were 
victimized at a higher rate than households with higher incomes.
**********************************************************

The data in this report were drawn from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ 
(BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The NCVS collects 
information on nonfatal crimes reported and not reported to the police from a 
nationally representative sample of U.S. households. Interviews are conducted 
every 6 months over 3 years, with the first interview conducted in person and 
the follow-up interviews conducted either in person or by phone.

The NCVS produces national estimates of rates and levels of violent and 
property crime victimization, as well as information on the characteristics 
of crimes and victims and the consequences of victimization. This report 
presents aggregate estimates of household burglary victimization, with 
household victimization as the basic unit of analysis.

The remainder of this report focuses on completed burglaries. Trend estimates 
are based on 2-year rolling averages centered on the most recent year. Other 
tables present data from 3 years: 1994, 2001, and 2011, which also represent 
the average estimates for the 2-year period ending that year. For example, 
estimates reported for 2011 represent the average estimates for 2010 and 
2011. Presenting estimates based on two years of data improves the 
reliability and stability of comparisons over time and between subgroups. For 
additional estimates not included in this report, see the NCVS Victimization 
Analysis Tool (NVAT) on the BJS website.

**********************************************************
A third of completed burglaries involved the theft 
of an electronic device or household appliance in 2011
**********************************************************

Household burglary usually involved theft, and there was relative stability 
in the percentage of completed burglaries that involved the theft of 
different types of items (table 1). For instance, the percentage of completed 
burglaries in which cash, checks, a purse or wallet, credit cards, or bank 
cards were stolen was relatively stable between 1994 (15%), 2001 (18%) and 
2011 (17%). From 1994 to 2011, the largest percentage of completed burglary 
consistently involved the theft of personal items (such as clothing, furs, 
luggage, briefcases, jewelry, watches, and keys) and electronics or household 
appliances (including TVs, DVD players, and protable electronic devices).

There was one exception to the stability in the type of items stolen during 
household burglaries from 2001 to 2011. The percentage of burglaries that 
involved the theft of a portable electronic device or household appliance 
increased from 28% to 34%. In comparison, during this same period, the 
percentage of completed burglaries that involved the theft of a bicycle, 
bicycle parts, or recreational or sporting equipment declined from 13% to 9%.

**********************************************************
From 1994 to 2011, the median dollar value of items 
and cash stolen during completed burglaries increased 54%
**********************************************************

From 1994 to 2011, between 68% and 81% of burglarized households experienced 
losses of $1 or more as a result of the victimization (appendix table 4). 
Among households that lost $1 or more during completed burglaries, the median 
dollar value (inflation adjusted to 2011 dollars) of items and cash stolen 
increased 54%, from $389 in 1994 to $600 in 2011 (figure 2).***Footnote 1 
1Amount of loss was unknown for a small percentage of households, which may 
result in an underestimation of loss.*** The median dollar value of stolen 
goods ranged from a low of $366 in 2004 to a high of $618 in 2010, 
representing a 69% difference. In 2011, the average dollar loss among the 73% 
of burglarized households that lost $1 or more was about $2,116. (See 
Methodology for more information on inflation adjustment.)

Measuring burglary in the NCVS
********************************

Burglary is the illegal entry or attempted entry of a residence that occurs 
when the person entering has no legal right to be present. The entry may be 
by force or without force. Burglary includes illegal entry of a garage, shed, 
or any other structure on the property’s premises, as well as a hotel or 
vacation residence.

Attempted forcible entry--Force is used in an attempt to gain entry to a 
residence.

Attempted unlawful entry--No force is involved in an attempt to gain entry. 
An example is jiggling a door knob to see if the door is unlocked. The NCVS 
does not collect information about attempted unlawful entry.

Completed forcible entry--Force is used to successfully gain entry to a 
residence. Examples include breaking a window or slashing a screen.

Completed unlawful entry--No force is used but the residence is entered by 
someone having no legal right to be on the premises. Examples include 
entering through an unlocked door or an open window.

Completed burglary--Includes completed forcible entries and completed 
unlawful entries. Completed burglaries do not necessarily involve stolen or 
damaged property.

**********************************************************

****************************************************
Completed burglaries that were reported to police 
increased from 51% in 1994 to 58% in 2011
****************************************************

From 1994 to 2001, the percentage of completed burglaries reported to police 
was relatively stable at about 50% (table 2). However, the percentage of 
completed burglaries reported to police increased from 52% in 2001 to 58% in 
2011.

Of the 1.6 million burglaries reported to police in 2011, the police came 
when notified in 85% of victimizations, an increase from 78% in 1994. The 
percentage of reported burglary victimizations in which the police did not go 
to the residence declined from 16% in 1994 to 10% in 2011.

*****************************************************
From 1994 to 2011, about 10% of reported burglaries 
resulted in an arrest
*****************************************************

Among victimizations in which the police were notified and responded, a 
greater percentage involved the police taking a report, gathering evidence, 
or promising investigation or surveillance in 2011 compared to 1994. For 
example, in 1994, the police took a report in 84% of the completed burglary 
victimizations to which they responded, compared to 91% in 2011. Of the 
victimizations in which police came when notified or the victim went to the 
police, the police promised to investigate or conduct surveillance in about 
25% of the victimizations in 2011, compared to 13% in 1994. Among completed 
burglaries reported to police, the percentage that resulted in an arrest at 
the scene remained relatively stable between 2% and 4% during the period. In 
addition, the percentage of reported burglaries that resulted in an arrest at 
any time in the investigation also remained relatively stable at about 10% in 
1994, 2001, and 2011.

When analyzed by amount of loss from cash stolen and items stolen or damaged, 
the percentage that was reported to police remained relatively stable from 
1994 to 2011 (figure 3). In 1994, 2001, and 2011, the highest percentage of 
burglaries reported to police was among victimizations that resulted in 
losses of $1,000 or more. In 2011, 83% of completed burglaries that resulted 
in losses of $1,000 or more were reported to police, compared to 68% with 
losses of $500 to $999, and 38% with losses of $1 to $499.

**********************************************************
Of completed burglaries that resulted in monetary loss, 
the percentage reported to insurance companies increased 
as the total amount of loss increased
**********************************************************

Each year from 1994 to 2011, the percentage of completed burglaries reported 
to insurance companies rose in accordance with the total amount of loss 
sustained during the burglary, with the exception of burglaries resulting in 
no loss (figure 4). Households that lost $1,000 were more likely to report 
the loss to an insurance company than households that lost $500 to $999, and 
households that lost $500 to $999 were more likely to report the loss than 
households that lost $1 to $499. From 1994 to 2011, less than 4% of 
burglaries resulting in no loss were reported to insurance companies. In 
2011, 35% of burglarized households with losses of $1,000 or more reported 
the loss to an insurance company, compared to 10% of households that lost 
$500 to $999 and 3% that lost $1 to $499.

Reports to insurance companies by burglary victims who experienced a loss of 
$1,000 or more declined from 1994 (41%) to 2003 (33%), and then remained 
relatively stable through 2011. Among burglarized households that lost $500 
to $999, the percentage that reported the loss to an insurance company also 
declined, from 22% in 1994 to 10% in 2011.

**********************************************************
Among completed burglaries that were reported to the 
police, the percentage that were also reported to 
insurance companies increased with the amount of loss
**********************************************************

In 1994, 2001, and 2011, burglarized households were more likely to file a 
claim with an insurance company when the victimization was reported to the 
police (table 3). Among households that reported a completed burglary to 
police, the percentage that also reported the victimization to insurance 
companies increased as the amount of loss increased. In 2011, 7% of 
households reported a loss of $1 to $499, compared to 14% when the household 
experienced a loss of $500 to $999, and 42% when the household experienced a 
loss of $1,000 or more.

Households that did not report a completed burglary to police were unlikely 
to report the burglary to an insurance company, regardless of the amount of 
loss. In 1994, 2001, and 2011, less than 5% of burglarized households that 
did not report the incident to police reported it to an insurance company.

**********************************************************
From 1994 to 2011, the rate of completed burglary decreased 
by at least half across households headed by persons of all 
races and Hispanic origin
**********************************************************

From 1994 to 2011, the rate of completed burglary decreased by at least half 
across households headed by persons of all races and Hispanic origin (table 
4). During this period, completed burglaries decreased 57% among households 
headed by a white non-Hispanic person (from 48.3 to 20.8 victimizations per 
1,000 households) and 52% among households headed by a black non-Hispanic 
person (from 67.3 to 32.2 victimizations per 1,000 households). The greatest 
decline (67%) in the rate of burglary victimization was among households 
headed by a Hispanic person, (from 76.0 to 24.9 victimizations per 1,000 
households). In 2011, households in which the head of household was a non-
Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native (59.8 per 1,000 households) or two 
or more races (80.5 per 1,000 households) were victimized at a higher rate 
than households headed by a person of any other race.

Burglary rates also declined by at least 50% for households headed by persons 
of all age groups. In 2011, households headed by a person age 19 or younger 
had the highest rate of victimization (49.7 per 1,000 households) compared to 
any other age group.

Among various types of household composition, households composed of married 
couples experienced the greatest decrease (60%) in burglary victimizations 
from 1994 (42 per 1,000 households) to 2011 (16.6 per 1,000 households). In 
2011, households composed of two or more adults (21.0 per 1,000) had a lower 
rate of burglary than households comprised of a single male (26.8 per 1,000) 
or female (27.6 per 1,000) adult.

**********************************************************
Households with an income of $14,999 or less were 
victimized at a higher rate than households with 
higher incomes
**********************************************************

Regardless of residence location, the rate of completed burglaries decreased 
from 1994 to 2011 (table 5). The largest decline (63%) was found among 
households in urban areas, as the rate declined from 70.9 to 26.3 burglaries 
per 1,000 households from 1994 to 2011. During the same period, burglaries in 
suburban areas declined 51% (from 40.4 to 19.8 per 1,000 households), and 
burglaries in rural areas declined 48% (from 52.5 to 27.2 per 1,000 
households). While households in urban areas had the highest rate of burglary 
in 1994, households in urban areas and rural areas had similar rates of 
burglary in 2011. Both rates remained higher than the rate of burglary in 
suburban areas in 2011.

From 1994 to 2011, the rate of completed burglaries decreased in households 
of all income levels. The greatest decline (74%) occurred in households 
earning $75,000 or more, from 48.2 per 1,000 households in 1994 to 12.7 per 
1,000 households in 2011.

In 1994, 2001, and 2011, households with an income of $14,999 or less were 
victimized at a higher rate than households with higher incomes. In 2011, 
households with an income of $14,999 or less experienced a burglary rate of 
45.1 per 1,000 households, compared to 29.7 per 1,000 households earning 
$15,000 to $34,999, and 12.7 per 1,000 households earning $75,000 or more.
Consistent across all three years, households that were renting the residence 
were burglarized at a higher rate than households that owned the residence. 
In 2011, the rate of completed burglary was 18.3 per 1,000 households that 
owned the property and 32.7 per 1,000 households that rented.

**********************************************************
Burglary rates by household structural characteristics, 
2004–2011
**********************************************************
Several structural characteristics of residences were also
associated with variations in household burglary rates 
(table 6). In the 2004–11 period, residences located in 
gated or walled communities (20.1 burglaries per 1,000 
households) were burglarized at a lower rate than residences 
not located in gated or walled communities (24.9 per 1,000 
households). Similarly, residences with restricted access, 
such as apartment or condominium buildings with a doorman 
or reception desk were burglarized at a lower rate (22.3 
burglaries per 1,000 households) than those without 
restricted access (24.7 per 1,000 households).

Methodology
***************

Survey coverage
------------------

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an annual data collection 
conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
(BJS). The NCVS is a self-report survey in which interviewed persons are 
asked about the number and characteristics of victimizations experienced 
during the prior 6 months. The NCVS collects information on nonfatal personal 
crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and 
personal larceny) and household property crimes (burglary, motor vehicle 
theft, and other theft) both reported and not reported to police. In addition 
to providing annual level and change estimates on criminal victimization, the 
NCVS is the primary source of information on the nature of criminal 
victimization incidents. Survey respondents provide information about 
themselves (such as age, sex, race and ethnicity, marital status, education 
level, and income) and whether they experienced victimization. The survey 
collects information for each victimization incident, including data about 
the offender (such as age, race and ethnicity, sex, and victim-offender 
relationship), characteristics of the crime (including time and place of 
occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic consequences), 
whether the crime was reported to police, reasons the crime was or was not 
reported, and experiences with the criminal justice system.

Trained interviewers administer the NCVS to persons age 12 or older from a 
nationally representative sample of households in the United States. The NCVS 
defines a household as a group of members who all reside at a sampled address 
that is their usual place of residence at the time of the interview and when 
they have no other usual place of residence. Once selected, households remain 
in the sample for 3 years, and eligible persons in the households are 
interviewed every 6 months for a total of seven interviews. New households 
rotate into the sample on an ongoing basis to replace outgoing households 
that have been in the sample for the 3-year period. The sample includes 
persons living in group quarters, such as dormitories, rooming houses, and 
religious group dwellings. Persons living in military barracks and 
institutional settings, such as correctional or hospital facilities, and the 
homeless are excluded from the sample. (For more information, see the Survey 
Methodology in Criminal Victimization in the United States, 2008, NCJ 231173, 
BJS website, May 2011.)

In 2011, 79,800 households were interviewed for the NCVS, representing a 90% 
household response rate. Victimizations that occurred outside of the United 
States were excluded from this report. 

****************************************
Weighting adjustments for estimating 
household victimization
****************************************

Estimates in this report use data from the 1993 to 2011 NCVS data files. 
These files can be weighted to produce annual estimates of victimization for 
persons age 12 or older living in U.S. households. Because the NCVS relies on 
a sample rather than a census of the entire U.S. population, weights are 
designed to inflate sample point estimates to known population totals and to 
compensate for survey nonresponse and other aspects of the sample design.

The NCVS data files include both person and household weights. Person weights 
provide an estimate of the population represented by each person in the 
sample. Household weights provide an estimate of the total U.S. household 
population. Both household and person weights, after proper adjustment, are 
also typically used to form the denominator in calculations of crime rates.

Household weights used in this analysis account for repeat victims of series 
incidents. The weight counts series incidents as the actual number of 
incidents reported by the household, up to a maximum of 10 incidents. Series 
victimizations are similar in type but occur with such frequency that a 
victim is unable to recall each individual event or describe each event in 
detail. Survey procedures allow NCVS interviewers to identify and classify 
these similar victimizations as series victimizations and to collect detailed 
information on only the most recent incident in the series. In 2011, about 3% 
of all victimizations were series incidents. Weighting series incidents as 
the number of incidents up to a maximum of 10 incidents produces more 
reliable estimates of crime levels, while the cap at 10 minimizes the effect 
of extreme outliers on the rates. Additional information on the series 
enumeration is detailed in the report Methods for Counting High Frequency 
Repeat Victimizations in the National Crime Victimization Survey, NCJ 237308, 
BJS website, April 2012.

Trend estimates are based on 2-year rolling averages centered on the most 
recent year. Other tables present data from 3 years: 1994, 2001, and 2011, 
which also represent the average estimates from the 2-year period ending that 
year. For example, estimates reported for 2011 represent the average 
estimates for 2010 and 2011. These methods of analysis improve the 
reliability and stability of estimate comparisons over time.

Standard error computations
----------------------------

When national estimates are derived from a sample, as is the case with the 
NCVS, caution must be taken when comparing one estimate to another or when 
comparing estimates over time. Although one estimate may be larger than 
another, estimates based on a sample have some degree of sampling error. The 
sampling error of an estimate depends on several factors, including the 
amount of variation in the responses, the size of the sample, and the size of 
the subgroup for which the estimate is computed. When the sampling error 
around the estimates is taken into consideration, the estimates that appear 
different may not be statistically different.

One measure of the sampling error associated with an estimate is the standard 
error. The standard error can vary from one estimate to the next. In general, 
for a given metric, an estimate with a smaller standard error provides a more 
reliable approximation of the true value than an estimate with a larger 
standard error. Estimates with relatively large standard errors are 
associated with less precision and reliability and should be interpreted with 
caution.

In order to generate standard errors around numbers and estimates from the 
NCVS, the Census Bureau produces generalized variance function (GVF) 
parameters for BJS. The GVFs take into account aspects of the NCVS complex 
sample design and represent the curve fitted to a selection of individual 
standard errors based on the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The 
GVF parameters were used in the report to generate standard errors for each 
point estimate (such as counts, percentages, and rates).

BJS conducted tests to determine whether differences in estimated numbers and 
percentages were statistically significant once sampling error was taken into 
account. Using statistical programs developed specifically for the NCVS, all 
comparisons in the text were tested for significance. The primary test 
procedure used was Student’s t-statistic, which tests the difference between 
two sample estimates. To ensure that the observed differences between 
estimates were larger than might be expected due to sampling variation, the 
significance level was set at the 95% confidence level.

Data users can use the estimates and the standard errors of the estimates 
provided in this report to generate a confidence interval around each 
estimate as a measure of the margin of error. The following example 
illustrates how standard errors can be used to generate confidence intervals:

** According to the NCVS, from 2010 to 2011, there were 26.3 completed 
burglaries per 1,000 households in urban areas (see table 5). Using the GVFs, 
BJS determined that the estimate has a standard error of 1.2 completed 
burglaries per 1,000 households (see appendix table 10). A confidence 
interval around the estimate was generated by multiplying the standard errors 
by ±1.96 (the t-score of a normal, two-tailed distribution that excludes 2.5% 
at either end of the distribution). Therefore, the confidence interval around 
the 26.3 completed burglaries per 1,000 households estimate is equal to 26.3 
± 1.2 X 1.96 (or 24.0 completed burglaries per 1,000 households to 28.7 
completed burglaries per 1,000 households). In other words, if different 
samples using the same procedures were taken from the U.S. population during 
the period from 2010 to 2011, 95% of the time the rate of completed 
burglaries in urban areas would fall between 24.0 and 28.7.

In this report, BJS also calculated a coefficient of variation (CV) for all 
estimates, representing the ratio of the standard error to the estimate. CVs 
provide a measure of reliability and a means to compare the precision of 
estimates across measures with differing levels or metrics. In cases where 
the CV was greater than 50%, or the unweighted sample had 10 or fewer cases, 
the estimate was noted with a “!” symbol (interpret data with caution; 
estimate is based on 10 or fewer sample cases, or the coefficient of 
variation exceeds 50%).


Many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one another 
and to other variables not included in the analyses. Complex relationships 
among variables in this report were not fully explored and warrant more 
extensive analysis. Readers are cautioned not to draw causal inferences based 
on the results presented.

Adjusting for inflation
------------------------

All dollar values in the report are presented in constant 2011 dollars. 
Estimates were adjusted for 2011 inflation using the consumer price index for 
all consumers (CPI-U) adjustment factor. The CPI-U is the broadest and most 
comprehensive consumer price index (www.bls.gov).

Methodological changes to the NCVS in 2006
-------------------------------------------

Methodological changes implemented in 2006 may have affected the crime 
estimates for that year to such an extent that they are not comparable to 
estimates from other years. Evaluation of 2007 and later data from the NCVS 
conducted by BJS and the Census Bureau found a high degree of confidence that 
estimates for 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 are consistent with and 
comparable to estimates for 2005 and previous years. The reports, Criminal 
Victimization, 2006, NCJ 219413, December 2007; Criminal Victimization, 2007, 
NCJ 224390, December 2008; Criminal Victimization, 2008, NCJ 227777, 
September 2009; Criminal Victimization, 2009, NCJ 231327, October 2010; 
Criminal Victimization, 2010, NCJ 235508, September 2011; and Criminal 
Victimization, 2011, NCJ 239437, October 2012, are available on the BJS 
website.

Although caution is warranted when comparing data from 2006 to other years, 
the use of 2-year rolling averages in this report diminishes the potential 
variation between 2006 and other years. In general, findings do not change 
significantly if the year 2006 is excluded from the analyses.
