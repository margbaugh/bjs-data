Americans age 12 or older experienced fewer violent and property
crimes in 1997 than in any other year since the 1973 inception
of the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).  In 1997 as
measured by the survey, U.S. residents age 12 or older
experienced almost 35 million criminal victimizations, down from
about 44 million such crimes experienced in 1973.
***note****Estimates from before 1993 were adjusted following
the 1992 NCVS redesign.*** The 1997 estimate was also a decrease
from almost 37 million violent and property victimizations in
1996.

Of the crimes in 1997, 8.6 million involved the violent crimes
of rape, sexual assault, robbery, and assault; 25.8 million
involved the property crimes of theft, household burglary, and
motor vehicle theft; and 0.4 million involved personal thefts
such as purse snatching.

Highlights
*************************

*The NCVS property and violent crime rates are the lowest
recorded since the survey's inception in 1973. ***note***After
adjusting rates following the 1992 NCVS redesign.***

*The downward trend in violent victimization begun in 1994-95
continued in 1997.

*In 1997, violent crime rates were 21% lower than they had been
in 1993.  Property crime rates were 22% below 1993 property
crime rates.

*The recent decreasing violent and property crime trends were
experienced by most segments of the population.   However, in
1997 the violent victimization rates for persons age 50 or
older were no lower than they had been in 1993.

*The violent and property crime rates each declined by 7% in
1996-97.

*The murder rate declined 8% between 1996 and 1997. 

*In 1997 as in past years, males and younger people were more
vulnerable to violent crime victimization than females and older
persons, respectively.  Blacks experienced higher violent crime
rates than whites or persons of other races.

*In 1997, as in previous years, males experienced higher
victimization rates than females for all violent crimes except
rape/sexual assault. 

*In 1997, 4 of 10 violent and property crimes were reported to
police.  Females and blacks were more likely to report a violent
crime to police than were males and whites.

*About half of all violent crimes in 1997 were committed by
someone whom the victim knew.

*************************end of box *****************************

In 1997 there were 39 violent victimizations per 1,000 persons
age 12 or older, down significantly from the 42 per 1,000 in
1996.  The 1997 property crime rate of 248 per 1,000 households
was lower than the 266 per 1,000 households experienced in 1996.
These declines continued a general downward trend in criminal
victimization that began in 1995.

The trends reported in this Bulletin encompass 1993 through
1997.  The  initial year was the first in which the  redesigned
NCVS used a full sample of households.  Compared to 1993 rates, 
the 1997 victimization rates for every type of violent and 
property crime measured by the NCVS showed a significant decrease.  
Between 1993 and 1997 the violent crime rate declined by 21%, 
and the property crime rate fell by 22%.

Violent crime
*********************

The NCVS collects data on nonfatal violent crimes against
persons age 12 and older, both reported and not reported to
police.  The Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) program of the FBI
collects data on murder and non-negligent manslaughter.

From 1996 to 1997, the murder rate declined by 8% and the
violent crime rate fell by 7%.  Of the violent crimes measured
by the NCVS, only robbery showed a significant decline from
1996, while simple assault was down slightly (table 1 and figure
1).

Note:  The number of victimization may differ from those reported previously because the estimates
are now based on data collected in each calendar year rather than data about events within a calendar
year.  (See Survey methodology on page 9.)  Completed violent crimes include rape, sexual assault,
robbery with or without injury, aggravated assault with injury, and simple assault with minor injury.
In 1994 the total population age 12 or older was 213,135,890; in 1995, 215,080,690; in 1996, 217,234,280
and in 1997,219,839,110.  The total number of households in 1994 was 100,568,060; in 1995, 101,504,820;
1996,102,697,490; and in 1997,103,988,670.

**********************end of table 1**********************

For aggravated assault the apparent decline was not
statistically significant.

*********************
Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter 
*********************

In 1997 there were 6.8 murders per 100,000 inhabitants.  This
represents an 8% decline from the previous year.  The decrease
was apparent across all sizes of cities and regions.  (See the
box.)

*********************
Violent crime measured by the NCVS
*********************

While overall violent crime measured by the NCVS declined from
1996 to 1997, the only type of violent crime for which the decrease
was statistically significant was robbery.  There was also a
marginally significant decline in the rate of simple assault
victimizations due to a slight decrease in simple assault without 
injury.  For completed rape, an apparent increase was not 
significant, nor were apparent declines in attempted rape 
and aggravated assault when threatened with a weapon.

The apparent 1996-97 increase in personal theft, comprising
pocket picking and purse snatching, was not statistically
significant.

Among demographic groups examined, only for males,
non-Hispanics, and Midwesterners were the 1996-97 declines in 
violent crime statistically significant, while for whites, 
the decline was marginally significant.

************************************************                            

For non-Hispanics and Midwest residents, the overall decreases
in violent crime were the result of decreases in robbery and
simple assault, while whites experienced a decrease in the rate
of simple assault.  No demographic group examined experienced a
decline in aggravated assault. 

********************
Property crime
********************

Household burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft make up the
property crimes measured by the NCVS.  In the aggregate,
property crime declined 7% between 1996 and 1997.  The 8%
decline in thefts included at least slight decreases in thefts
at all value levels measured:  under $50, $50-$249, and $250 or
more.  Apparent changes from 1996 to 1997 in the rates of
household burglary and motor vehicle theft were not
statistically significant.

The decrease in property crime from 1996 to 1997 was broadly
based.  Households in all types of localities and in all regions
except the South experienced less property crime in 1997, when
compared to the previous year.  (See appendix table 1.)

In 1997 while white and non-Hispanic households were less
victimized, black and Hispanic households were victimized at
about the same rate as in 1996. 

Urban households and those in the Northeast experienced less
burglary in 1997 than in 1996.  For non-Hispanic households the
1997 rate was slightly lower than in the previous year.  For no
other identified category of victims was the 1997 burglary rate
lower than the 1996 rate.  

The decline in theft was experienced by most, but not all,
demographic groups examined.  While white and other-race
households and non-Hispanic households were less vulnerable to
theft in 1997 than in 1996, the decline for black households and
Hispanic households was not great enough to be statistically
significant.

By region, only in the South did the theft rate not fall from
1996 to 1997.  Households in urban, suburban, and rural areas
all were less victimized by theft in 1997 than in the previous
year. 

********************
Characteristics of victims of violent crime, 1997 
********************

While victimization rates for persons in demographic groups
fluctuate from year to year, the characteristics of  crime
victims and victimizations exhibit a large degree of stability
over time. 

The demographic groups that were in 1997 the most vulnerable to
specific violent crimes and to overall violent victimization
were, in general, also the most vulnerable to victimization in
previous years.

****************
Sex of victim
****************

As in past years, except for rape and sexual assault, males were
more likely than females to be victims of violent crime (table 2).  
Men were twice as likely as women to experience robbery and were
also more likely to be victims of aggravated and simple assault.
Women sustained rape or sexual assault at a rate about 8 times
that of men.

************************end of table 2***********************

*****************
Race of victim
*****************

Blacks were more likely than whites to be victims of violent
crime, who in turn were  more likely than those of other races
(Asians or Native Americans).  Blacks had higher rates than
whites for robbery and aggravated assault.  The apparent
difference in simple assault rates was not statistically
significant. Blacks were victims of robbery at a rate about
double that of whites.

********************
Ethnicity of victim
********************

In 1997 Hispanics were about as likely to be victims of
rape/sexual assault, aggravated assault, and simple assault as
non-Hispanics.  Only for robbery did Hispanics experience a
higher rate than non-Hispanics.  

*********************
Age of victim
*********************

The patterns of violent victimization across the age spectrum
that existed in 1996 continued to be present in 1997.  Persons
between ages 12 and 15 and between 16 and 19 had higher violent
crime victimization rates than did persons age 25 or older. 
Persons age 12-19 were about twice as likely as persons age
25-34 and about 3 times as likely as persons age 35-49 to be
victims of violent crimes.  Persons age 12-19 had a violent
crime victimization rate about 20 times that of persons age 65
or older.  Persons age 16-19 had a significantly higher rate of
aggravated assault than did any other age group.

********************
Household income
********************

In general, violent crime rates are lowest for those in higher
income brackets and highest for those in lower income brackets
(table 3).  Persons in households with an annual income of less
than $7,500 experienced significantly more violent crime than
persons in households at any other income level, while persons
in households with incomes of $75,000 or more experienced
significantly less than households with incomes below $50,000.

*************************end of table 3*************************

Persons in households in the middle range of income ($15,000-
$49,999) had similar rates of victimization in comparison to one
another but significantly different rates from the lowest and
highest income groups.

*********************
Marital status
*********************

Never married persons and those who had separated or divorced
had higher violent victimization rates than those who were
married or had been widowed.  For assault, persons who were
never married were victimized at rates higher than people in any
other marital status.  Persons who had been widowed were the
least vulnerable to assault.

*********************
Region
*********************

People residing in the West were more vulnerable to violent
crime victimization than people residing in any other region in
the country.  People living in the Northeast, Midwest, and South
had similar victimization rates in 1997.

*********************
Urbanization
*********************

Urban residents had overall violent victimization rates
significantly higher than suburban residents, who in turn had
rates higher than rural residents. However, there was no
difference in the rate at which suburban and rural residents
were victims of rape/sexual assault or aggravated assault. 

*********************
Victim-offender relationship
*********************

About half of all violent crimes in 1997 were committed by
someone whom the victim knew.  Victims of completed violence
were more likely than victims of attempted violence to report
that the offender was not a stranger.  Among the violent crimes
measured by the NCVS, rape/sexual assault was the crime most
likely to be committed by a nonstranger, and robbery was the
least likely.  Victims of simple assault were more likely than
victims of aggravated assault to report that the offender was a
nonstranger.

Statistics on murder are compiled from over 16,000 city, county
and State law enforcement agencies as part of the FBI's Uniform
Crime Reports (UCR).  For 1997 the UCR showed 18,210 murders -- a
rate of 6.8 murders per 100,000 persons.  The number of persons
per 100,000 U.S. population in 1997 was 8% lower than in 1996
and 28% lower than in 1993.

The FBI defines murder in its annual Crime in the United States
as the willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human being by
another. The incidence of murder varies across victim
characteristics.  While the number of homicides has decreased
since 1993, the pattern of characteristics of homicide victims
has remained relatively unchanged.

*Three-fourths of the victims were male.

*Whites and blacks each made up about 48% of murder victims.

*1 in 8 murder victims were under age 18.

*Firearms were used in about 7 in 10 murders.

*The homicide rate was highest in the South and lowest in the
Northeast.

*The homicide rate was higher in metropolitan cities than in
smaller cities and rural areas.

Characteristics of victims of property crime, 1997
*********************
Race/ethnicity of head of household
*********************

Black households were more likely than white or households of
other races (Asian or Pacific Islanders and American
Indians/Alaskan natives grouped together) to be victims of
property crimes (table 4).  Black households had higher rates of
household burglary and theft than did white and other race
households.  Black and other race households experienced motor
vehicle theft at rates about twice that of white households.

Hispanic households were more likely than non-Hispanic household
to be victims of each of the property crimes measured by the
NCVS:  burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft.  

*********************
Region, urbanization, and home ownership
*********************

As with violent crime, households in the West were more
vulnerable to property crime than households in other regions. 
The property crime rate was lowest in the Northeast.  

Overall, urban households had higher property crime rates than
suburban households, which in turn had higher rates than rural
households.  This order also occurred for theft and motor
vehicle theft.  For burglary, urban households were the most
vulnerable, but there was no significant difference between the
suburban and rural rates.  

For each type of property crime, people living in rented homes
or apartments had a significantly higher rate of victimization
than those living in their own homes.

*********************
Household income
*********************

In general, households with higher incomes were more susceptible
than those with lower incomes to theft and motor vehicle theft. 
Households with incomes $35,000 or above had the highest theft
victimization rates.

Conversely, the lower the income, the higher the likelihood of
burglary, in general.  Households with incomes below $7,500 had
burglary rates significantly higher than households with higher
annual incomes.  There were no differences in the burglary rates
of households in the income categories $35,000 and above. 

*********************
Reporting to the police
*********************

About a third of the crimes measured by the NCVS were reported
to law enforcement authorities, according to the victims.  Motor
vehicle thefts were reported to police at the highest rate --
80%, and thefts were reported at the lowest rate -- 28%.  Of
violent crimes, 59% of aggravated assaults were reported,
compared to 31% of rape or sexual assaults.

Among victims of violent crime, females were more likely than
males to report the crime to the police.

Black victims of violence were somewhat more likely than whites
to report to the police.  There was no significant difference
between Hispanic and non-Hispanic victims in the percentage
reporting a violent crime to the police.

Victimization trends, 1993-97
********************

The 1993-96 declining trends in violent and property crime
continued in 1997 (table 5).  While not all year-to-year changes 
for every category of crime were statistically significant, the 
overall rates for violent crime and every major type of crime
measured--rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault,
simple assault, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft--showed
statistically significant declines between 1993 and 1997.

Note:  Victimization rates may differ from those reported previously because the estimates are
now based on data collected in each calendar year rather than data about events within a calen-
dar year.  Completed violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery with or without injury, 
aggravated assault with injury, and simple assault with minor injury.  See the note on table 1, 
for the population counts, 1993-97.
*The difference is significant at the 95% confidence level.

****************************send of table 5********************

********************
Murder/nonnegligent manslaughter
********************

The number and rate of murder in all regions of the United
States have declined steadily since 1993.  (See the box on page
6.)  The characteristics of murder victims have remained 
relatively stable during that time.

********************
Violent crime
********************

The general pattern among violent crimes measured by the NCVS
was a nonsignificant increase in both the number and rate of
victimization between 1993 and 1994 and then a decline through
1997.  While some year-to-year changes in victimization rates
for violent crime in the aggregate and for some types of crime
were not significant, every type of violent crime declined
significantly over the whole period.

*********************
Personal theft
*********************

Personal theft includes pocket picking and attempted and
completed purse snatching.  The personal theft rate decreased
significantly from 1993 to 1997.

*********************
Property crime
*********************

The numbers and rates of property crime, both in the aggregate
and by type of crime declined throughout the 1993-97 period.  
However, as was the case with violent offenses, not every
year-to-year decrease was significant.

*********************
Characteristics of victims
*********************

The general downward trend in criminal victimization can be seen
across demographic characteristics such as victim sex, race, and
income.  Males and females, blacks and whites, and those at
different income levels all experienced declines from 1993-97 
for overall violent and property crime victimizations.  (See
appendix figure tables.)

Between 1993 and 1997 urban households did experience greater
declines in property crime rates than did suburban or rural
households. 

*********************
Survey methodology
*********************

Except for homicide data obtained from the FBI's Uniform Crime
Reporting program, this report presents data from the NCVS.  The
NCVS obtains information about crimes from an ongoing,
nationally representative sample of households in the United
States.  NCVS data include both those incidents reported and
those not reported to the police.  In 1997 approximately 43,000
households and 80,000 people age 12 and older were inter- 
viewed.  For the 1997 NCVS data presented here, the response
rates were 95% of eligible households and 89% of eligible
individuals. 

The data in this report are based upon interviews conducted
during the calendar year being estimated.  Because of the
retrospective nature of the survey, the estimates include some
incidents that actually occurred during the previous year. 
Analyses comparing the victimization information collected in a
calendar year (denoted here as a collection year) to that 
obtained about victimizations experienced in the same calendar 
year (called a data year) show only a small difference between 
the two methods.  For example, for 1995, the violent crime rate 
based on data year victimizations was 44.5 per 1,000 persons 
age 12 or older, compared to 46.6 based on the collection year 
method.  The differences will be greater during periods of 
changing crime rates and less during periods of stable rates.

********************
Computation of standard errors
********************

The comparisons made in this report were tested to determine
whether the observed differences were statistically significant.
Comparisons mentioned in the report passed a hypothesis test at 
the .05 level of statistical significance (or the 95% confidence 
level).  This means that the estimated difference between comparisons 
was greater than twice the standard error of that difference.  For
comparisons that were found to be statistically significant at
the 90% confidence level, the terms "somewhat different" or
"slight difference" are used.

Caution should be used when comparing estimates not discussed in
the text.  Seemingly large differences may not be statistically
significant at the 95% or even the 90% confidence level.  

Calculations were conducted with statistical programs developed
specifically for the NCVS by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. 
These programs take into account the complex NCVS sample design
when calculating generalized variance estimates.
