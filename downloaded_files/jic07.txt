          At midyear 2007, 2,163 inmates were confined in Indian
          country, up from 1,745 inmates (24%) at midyear 2004.
          This count was based on data for 83 facilities--jails,
          confinement facilities, detention centers, and other
          correctional facilities--in Indian country at midyear,
          up from 68 facilities at midyear 2004. The number
          (8,600) of American Indians and Alaska Natives
          confined outside of Indian country was 4 times greater
          than the number held in Indian country jails at
          midyear 2007 (see box on page 2). 
          
          After a decline in the Indian country jail population
          between 2000 and 2003, the number of inmates in Indian
          country jails has generally increased (figure 1). The
          annual growth rate slowed to 5% during the 12-month
          period between 2001 to 2002. At midyears ending 2003
          (-9%) and 2004 (-4%), Indian country jails experienced
          a decline in their inmate population. The Survey of
          Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) was not conducted in
          2005 and 2006.
          
          The number of jails in Indian country increased
          
          The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collected data
          from 68 correctional facilities in Indian country in
          2004 and from 79 facilities in 2007. Over the 3-year
          period, 7 facilities closed, 21 facilities in the 2007
          survey were newly constructed facilities or new to the
          collection, and 1 facility that was closed in 2004
          reopened and was included in the survey. Data were
          estimated for 4 facilities that did not respond to the
          2007 survey. 
          
          Bed space for inmates grew faster than the confined
          population in Indian country since 2004 
          
          At midyear 2007, jail facilities (83) in Indian
          country were rated to hold 2,900 inmates. On June 29,
          2007, those facilities held a total of 2,163 inmates
          and were operating at 75% of rated capacity (table 1).
          On an average day in June, the custody population was
          2,046 inmates, and facilities in Indian country were
          operating at 71% of capacity. From June 2004 to June
          2007, the overall number of beds (or rated capacity)
          grew at a faster rate (34%) than the 24% growth in the
          inmate population.
          
          The number of American Indians and Alaska Natives
          under correctional supervision--probation, parole or
          incarcerated in jail or prison--reached 71,274 at
          midyear 2007, up from 68,177 at midyear 2004
          
          According to the U.S. Census Bureau's National
          Population Estimates, an estimated 2,938,436 American
          Indians and Alaska Natives lived in the United States
          as of July 1, 2007. They accounted for less than 1% of
          the U.S. resident population and 1% of inmates in
          custody in jail or prison.
          
          The local governing authority on Indian lands is
          typically a tribal government or council. Jurisdiction
          over crimes in Indian country depends on several
          factors, including the identity of the victim and the
          offender, the severity of the crime, and the location 
          where the crime was committed. Tribal jurisdiction
          includes crimes committed by Indians in Indian
          country. Tribal rights to sentence offenders are
          limited to one year of imprisonment or a $5,000 fine,
          or both (25 U.S.C.  1302(7)). Federal jurisdiction
          over crime in Indian country includes 14 crimes under
          the Major Crimes Act of 1885 (18 U.S.C.  1153), and
          state jurisdiction includes all crimes on tribal lands
          specified under Public Law 280 (18 U.S.C.  1162).
          
          At midyear 2007, tribal, federal, and state prison or
          jail authorities held 942 American Indians per
          100,000--an incarceration rate based on 27,674
          American Indians in custody and 2.9 million in the
          U.S. resident population. The rate for American
          Indians was about 24% higher than the overall national
          rate of 761 persons of any other race or Hispanic
          origin per 100,000 U.S. residents.
          
          Federal, state, local, and tribal correctional
          authorities supervised 71,274 American Indians in
          2007, down from 74,145 in 2006 (figure 2). Between
          2000 and 2007, the number of American Indians confined
          in jails and prisons nationwide grew on average by
          about 4.6% annually.
          
          Of American Indians under any form of correctional
          supervision in 2007, most (61% or 43,600) were
          supervised in the community on probation or parole
          (table 2). A total of 27,674 American Indians were in
          prison or jail at midyear 2007. More than half
          (13,956) were held in state prison, and about 1 in 10
          (2,955) were held in federal prison. The remaining
          10,763 American Indians were confined in Indian
          country jails (2,163) and local jails (8,600). Some
          American Indians confined in local jails may have been
          adjudicated by a tribal criminal justice system and
          housed in jails under contracts with tribal, city, or
          county governments.
          
          Since the last Annual Survey of Jails in Indian
          Country was conducted in 2004, the number of American
          Indians under correctional supervision increased by
          4.5%. The number of American Indians confined in jails
          and prisons nationwide grew by approximately 19% from
          2004 to 2007. Over the 3-year period, the largest
          growth in the confined American Indian population
          occurred in Indian country jails (24%), followed by
          state prison (22%), federal prison (21%), and local
          jails (15%).
          
          Most inmates were confined in the larger Indian
          country jail facilities rated to hold 25 or more
          inmates
          
          Based on the data reported by 79 facilities, 1,996
          inmates were confined in Indian country at midyear
          2007. Of those inmates, about 83% (1,655) were held in
          facilities (43) rated to hold 25 or more inmates
          (table 3). About half of the inmate population was
          held in facilities (30) rated to hold between 25 and
          49 inmates. Facilities (36) with a rated capacity of
          fewer than 25 inmates accounted for 46% of all
          facilities, and held 17% of the total inmate
          population in Indian country at midyear 2007.
          
          At midyear 2007, 14 jails in Indian country held over
          half (51%) of the total inmate population (table 4).
          Between midyear 2004 and midyear 2007, the inmate
          population in those jails increased by 231 persons
          (33%).
          
          More than a third of the large Indian country jails
          rated to hold 25 or more inmates were located in
          Arizona. These jails held 30% (590 inmates) of the
          total custody population in Indian country. In
          absolute numbers, the Gila River Department of
          Rehabilitation and Supervision in Arizona reported the
          largest increase in the number of inmates (80) held
          between midyear 2004 and midyear 2007. The White
          Mountain Apache Detention Center reported the largest
          decline (37% or 34 inmates) in its inmate population
          during this period.
          
          The new Choctaw Justice Complex Adult Detention in 
          Mississippi had the largest percentage change in its
          inmate population following the closing of the Choctaw
          Detention Center. At midyear 2007, the Choctaw Justice
          Complex Adult Detention Center held 41 inmates, up
          from 6 at midyear 2004.
          
          The smallest and largest jails in Indian country used
          less bed space for confined inmates
          
          Seventy-nine Indian country jails were operating at
          about 71% of rated capacity on an average day in June
          and at about 75% of rated capacity at midyear 2007.***
          See table 12 for total and facility-level data by
          state.*** An average day in June was based on the
          average daily population, or the number of inmates
          confined in June divided by 30. The lowest percent of
          capacity occupied during June 2007 was among the
          smallest and the largest jails (figure 3). Twelve
          jails (rated to hold fewer than 10 inmates) were
          operating at 22% of their rated capacity on an average
          day in June, compared to 37% at midyear 2007. Large
          jails in Indian country with a rated capacity of 50 or
          more inmates had more than half of their bed space
          occupied on an average day in June (56%) and at
          midyear (59%).
          
          Indian country jails rated to hold 25 to 49 inmates
          were operating near full capacity (95%) at midyear.
          Facilities rated to hold 10 to 49 inmates were
          operating at about 15% below rated capacity on an
          average day in June 2007. 
          
          The amount of bed space occupied was also measured
          based on a facility's most crowded day in June. About
          4 in 10 facilities (31) in Indian country were
          operating above rated capacity on the facility's most
          crowded day in June (table 5). Of those facilities, 19
          were operating above rated capacity at midyear, and 15
          were operating above rated capacity on an average day
          in June 2007. 
          
          18 jails were operating at more than 50% over capacity
          on their most crowded day in June 2007
          
          At midyear 2007, 18 jails in Indian country reported
          operating at more than 50% over their rated capacity
          on the facility's most crowded day in June 2007, up
          from 13 facilities in June 2004 (table 6). Each jail
          had a rated capacity of fewer than 50 inmates.
          
          Among jails (18) operating at more than 50% over rated
          capacity on their peak day in June 2007, more than
          half (11) were rated to hold fewer than 25 inmates.
          Seven were rated to hold 25 or more inmates. The
          largest of the jails, Warm Springs Police Department
          and Adult Detention Center, had a rated capacity of 48
          inmates and was operating at 60% over capacity. The
          White Mountain Apache Detention Center had a rated
          capacity of 45 inmates and was 187% over capacity on
          its peak day in June. The smallest of the 18 jails,
          San Juan Pueblo Police Department Holding Facility,
          had a rated capacity of 2 inmates and held 10 inmates
          (or 400% over capacity) on its most crowded day in
          June. 
          
          The Pine Ridge Police Department and Adult Detention
          Center had the highest occupancy rate (575%) and the
          largest number of inmates over capacity (114) on its
          most crowded day in June 2007. Of the 18 facilities,
          the Fort Peck Police Department and Adult Detention
          Center had the lowest occupancy rate (155%) on its
          peak day in June 2007. 
          
          Six of the 18 facilities were operating at more than
          50% over their rated capacity at midyear 2007 and also
          on their most crowded day in June. Four facilities
          were operating at more than 50% over capacity on an
          average day in June. The Tohono O'odham Adult
          Detention Center and the Northern Cheyenne Adult
          Detention Center were operating at more than 50% over
          capacity at midyear and also on the facility's average
          day in June 2007.
               
          High volume of inmates were processed through Indian
          country jails
          
          Indian country jails admitted 12,490 persons during
          June 2007 (table 7). Nearly 43% (5,354) of all
          admissions in June 2007 occurred in facilities rated
          to hold between 25 and 49 inmates. Combined, the 79
          facilities had about 158 admissions per month on
          average (not shown in a table). Twenty-four facilities
          rated to hold between 10 and 24 inmates had the
          largest number of admissions (207) per month on
          average during June 2007. Thirty facilities rated to
          hold between 25 and 49 inmates admitted 178 persons
          per month on average, followed closely by 13
          facilities rated to hold 50 or more inmates that
          admitted 152 persons per month on average. Twelve
          facilities rated to hold fewer than 10 inmates
          admitted about 17 persons per month on average during
          June 2007.
          
          In 2007, 77 facilities reported on deaths in custody
          between July 1, 2006, and June 30, 2007. One inmate
          death was reported by jail authorities during that
          period. Seventy-three facilities reported on inmates
          who had attempted suicide. During the 12-month period,
          80 inmates held in Indian country facilities had
          attempted suicide. 
          
          Average length of stay was 4.5 days for Indian country
          jail inmates in June 2007
          
          During June 2007, inmates confined in Indian country
          jails were held an average of 4.5 days, up from 4 days
          during the same period in 2004. The average length of
          stay for inmates was the highest (9.4 days) in
          facilities that were rated to hold 50 or more inmates.
          Inmates held in jails rated to hold 10 to 24 inmates
          experienced the shortest average length of stay (2.1
          days).
          
          Inmate characteristics remain relatively unchanged
          
          Inmate characteristics by gender, age, and offense
          have changed in absolute numbers since 2000 (table 8).
          However, the distribution within most categories has
          remained stable during the past 7 years.
           
          Adult males accounted for the largest portion of the
          inmate population in Indian country jails during the
          past 3 years. The absolute number of adult female
          inmates increased slightly, while the overall
          percentage of female inmates held in Indian country
          jails declined from 23% in 2004 to 21% in 2007.
           
          From 2004 to 2007, the percentage of inmates in
          custody with a conviction status increased by 16%,
          which was slightly higher than the overall growth rate
          (14%) of the inmate population in Indian country
          jails. About 4 in 10 inmates were confined for a
          violent offense at midyear 2007, up slightly from 39%
          in 2004. Domestic violence (20%) accounted for the
          largest percentage of violent offenders held in 2007,
          up from 15% in 2002. Simple or aggravated assault
          accounted for 13% of violent offenses in 2007,
          followed by rape or sexual assault (2%). 
          
          At midyears 2004 and 2007, less than 1 in 10 (7% in
          both years) inmates in Indian country jails were in
          custody for a drug offense. In absolute numbers, 132
          inmates were in custody for a drug law violation at
          midyear 2007, up from 104 in 2004. Inmates in custody
          for a DWI/DUI offense declined during the 7-year
          period, from 17% at midyear 2000 to 8% at midyear
          2007.
          
          Jail operations staff accounted for the majority of
          persons employed by Indian country jails
          
          Seventy-seven jails in Indian country employed 1,236 
          persons at midyear 2007 (table 9). About 70% (870) of
          all personnel were jail operations staff, including
          correctional officers and other staff who spent more
          than 50% of their time supervising inmates. The
          remaining 366 jail personnel included administrative
          employees, educational staff, technical or
          professional staff, and clerical, maintenance, or food
          service staff. Seventy-six facilities reported that
          532 (63%) correctional officers had received basic
          detention officer certification, and 604 (70%) had
          received 40 hours of in-service training. Overall,
          there were approximately 2.3 inmates per every jail
          operations employee at midyear 2007, down from 2.5 at
          midyear 2004. 
          
          Nearly all Indian country jails provided medical and
          mental health services to inmates; most jails tested
          for infectious diseases
          
          An addendum to the 2007 Annual Survey of Jails in
          Indian Country obtained in-depth data on inmate health
          services and facility programs. For the second time
          since 2004, information was collected on HIV,
          hepatitis B and C, and tuberculosis. Other questions
          in the addendum asked about inmate medical services,
          mental health services, suicide prevention procedures,
          substance dependency programs, domestic violence
          counseling, sex offender treatment, educational
          programs, and inmate work assignments. Seventy-eight
          of the 83 facilities surveyed responded to at least a
          portion of the addendum, covering 91% (1,976) of the
          2,163 inmates held at midyear 2007.
          
          All facilities (78) responding to the addendum
          provided inmates with some form of medical health
          service on or off facility grounds (table 10).
          Seventy-two facilities provided mental health services
          to inmates, including screening at intake, psychiatric
          evaluation, 24-hour care, psychotropic medication,
          routine therapy or counseling, and community mental
          health referral services.
          
          Seventy-three facilities reported following at least
          one suicide prevention procedure, with 63 assessing
          inmates at intake for risk of suicide and 64
          maintaining specific cells or locations for inmates at
          risk. Other suicide prevention procedures included
          monitoring high-risk offenders, staff training in risk
          assessment and suicide prevention, and providing
          special inmate counseling for suicide-risk offenders.
          
          Most Indian country jails screened inmates for
          infectious diseases, including HIV (55), hepatitis B
          (62), hepatitis C (61), and tuberculosis (63).
          Possible testing procedures included screening at
          admission to jail, at regular intervals while
          confined, at random, upon request, after exposure to
          the active disease or involvement in an incident, upon
          clinical indication of need, and at release from jail.
          
          Over half of facilities in Indian country offered GED
          classes to inmates in 2007
          
          At midyear 2007, 78 facilities reported the
          availability of treatment, counseling, and special
          programs for inmates confined in Indian country jails.
          These programs included 
           
          Treatment and counseling programs
          
          *Alcohol dependency counseling or awareness programs
          were available on or off the facility grounds in 59
          facilities (table 11). 
          
          *Counseling programs to address drug dependency were
          available on or off the facility grounds in 56 Indian
          country jails.
           
          *Sex offender treatment was available in 9 facilities.
          
          *Domestic violence counseling was available in 38
          facilities.
          
          Life skills and religious/spiritual counseling
          programs
          
          *Life skills and community adjustment training,
          including personal finance and conflict resolution
          programs, were available in 29 facilities. 
          
          *Parenting and child-rearing skill classes were
          available in 23 facilities. 
          
          *Religious and spiritual counseling programs were

          facilities.
          
          Employment and educational programs
          
          *Twelve facilities offered vocational training to
          inmates, and 14 jails provided classes in job seeking
          and interviewing skills.
          
          *Over half of the facilities (41) offered General
          Educational Development classes (GED) to inmates. 
          
          *More than a third of the facilities (28) had an
          accredited education program for inmates that included
          basic and high school classes.
          
          *Tutors were available to assist inmates in more than
          20% of the facilities (17).
          
          *Special education needs programs for inmates with
          learning disabilities were available in about 18% of
          the facilities (14) in 2007.
          
          *Twelve facilities (15%) offered college-level classes
          to inmates.
          
          More than 60% of facilities in Indian country provided
          work assignments for inmates in 2007.
          
          Forty-eight facilities offered inmates work
          assignments in office and administrative work, food
          service, and building and maintenance (not shown in a
          table). Public work assignments, such as road, park,
          or other public maintenance, were available to inmates
          in 26 facilities. Less than 10% of the facilities (5)
          offered inmates farming or agricultural work
          assignments. Two facilities offered inmates work
          assignments in correctional industries, which included
          working with wood products, textiles, and
          manufacturing services.
          
          Methodology
          
          The Annual Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC)
          includes all known Indian country correctional
          facilities operated by tribal authorities or the
          Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. Department of the
          Interior. The survey was conducted in June 2007 and
          included the number of inmates and percent of capacity
          occupied based on the average daily population,
          midyear population, and peak population in facilities
          in June 2007 (table 12).
          
          The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducted the
          SJIC to describe all adult and juvenile jail
          facilities and detention centers in Indian country.
          For this report, Indian country includes reservations,
          pueblos, rancherias, and other appropriate areas (18
          U.S.C. 1151). The reference date for the survey is
          June 29, 2007. 
          
          In 2007 the Office of Justice Services, Bureau of
          Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. Department of the Interior,
          provided a list of 86 Indian country jail facilities.
          The list included detention centers, jails, and other
          correctional facilities operated by tribal authorities
          or the BIA. Three facilities were non-operational.
          
          Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Through 
          follow-up phone calls and facsimiles, 79 out of 83
          facilities responded. Data were estimated for four
          facilities that did not respond to the survey. In
          2007, the survey included an addendum that collected
          in-depth data on inmate health services and facility
          programs. Seventy-eight facilities responded to at
          least a portion of the addendum.
          
          Average length of stay
          
          The stock/flow ratio method was used to measure the
          average length of stay for inmates held during June
          2007 in the 79 Indian country jails that responded to
          the survey:
          
          Stock--average daily population 
          
          Flow--inmate admissions during June 2007*** Jail
          admissions replaced releases in order to draw
          comparison to 2004, in which releases were not
          collected.*** 
          
           Stock/flow ratio in June 2007 (1,872/12,490) 
          
          Length of stay in days (0.15 X 30).
          
          Indian country is a statutory term that includes all
          lands within an Indian reservation, dependent Indian
          communities, and Indian trust allotments (18 U.S.C. 
          1151). Courts interpret  1151 to include all lands
          held in trust for tribes or their members. See United
          States v. Roberts, 185 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 1999).
          Tribal authority to imprison American Indian offenders
          is limited to one year per offense by statute (25
          U.S.C.  1302), a $5,000 fine, or both.
          
          Tribal law enforcement agencies act as first
          responders to both felony and misdemeanor crimes. For
          most of Indian country, the federal government
          provides felony law enforcement concerning crimes by
          or against Indians. Certain areas of Indian country
          are under Public Law 83-280, as amended. P.L. 280
          conferred jurisdiction on certain states over Indian
          country and suspended enforcement of the Major Crimes
          Act (18 U.S.C.  1153) and the General Crimes Act (18
          U.S.C.  1152) in those areas. Indian tribes retain
          concurrent jurisdiction to enforce laws in Indian
          country where P.L. 280 applies.
