Jails in Indian Country, 2015
******************************

Todd D. Minton, BJS Statistician

An estimated 2,510 inmates were confined in 76 Indian country 
jails at midyear 2015, a 5.5% increase from the 2,380 inmates 
confined in 79 facilities at midyear 2014 (figure 1). The average 
number of inmates per operating facility increased from 30 
inmates in 2014 to 33 inmates in 2015. At midyear 2015, the jail 
facilities in Indian country were rated to hold an estimated 
3,800 inmates, up from 3,720 in 2014. In 2015, approximately 
1,200 jail operations staff were employed to supervise the 
confined inmates, similar to the 1,230 jail operations staff at 
midyear 2014. ***Footnote 1 Jail operations staff include 
correctional officers, guards, and other staff who spend more 
than 50% of their time supervising inmates.***

*******************************************
Jails operating in Indian country increased 
from 68 facilities in 2004 to 76 in 2015
*******************************************

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has conducted the Annual 
Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) since 1998, although the 
survey was not conducted in 2005 and 2006. The number of 
operating jail facilities in Indian country increased from 68 in 
2004 to 76 in 2015. Over the 11-year period, 14 facilities 
permanently closed and 21 facilities were newly constructed. Two 
facilities in 2011 (one adult and one juvenile) were treated as a 
single respondent in 2010, and two facilities in 2011 merged into 
one facility in 2012. For more information on the SJIC universe 
from 1998 to 2003, see the Jails in Indian Country series, 
located on the BJS website.

HIGHLIGHTS
**************

* At midyear 2015, an estimated 2,510 inmates were confined in 76 
Indian country jails, a 5.5% increase from the 2,380 inmates 
confined at midyear 2014 in 79 facilities.

* The number of inmates admitted into Indian country jails during 
June 2015 (9,810) was four times the size of the average daily 
population (2,390).

* For the 76 facilities operating in June 2015, the expected 
average length of stay at admission for inmates was about 7 days.

* Three in 10 inmates were held for violent offenses at midyear 
2015, including domestic violence (13%), aggravated or simple 
assault (10%), unspecified violence (6%) and rape or sexual 
assault (2%).

* Similar to 2013 and 2014, at midyear 2015, 2 in 10 inmates were 
held for public intoxication.

* The ratio of inmates to jail operations employees was about 2 
inmates to 1 jail operations employee at midyear 2015, remaining 
stable since 2010.
*****************************************************************

BJS imputed inmate and facility population counts for facilities 
that did not respond to the survey, including seven facilities in 
2004 (213 inmates, or 12% of all inmates confined at midyear), 
four facilities in 2007 (167 or 8%), two facilities in 2013 (37 
or 2%), five facilities in 2014 (223 or 9%), and seven facilities 
in 2015 (384 or 15%). All operating facilities responded to 
surveys from 2008 to 2012. (See Methodology for information on 
jails in Indian country, including details on facility counts and 
survey participation.)

*******************************************
Occupied bed space declined from 86% of 
rated capacity in 2000 to 66% in 2015
*******************************************

At midyear 2015, the jail facilities in Indian country were rated 
to hold an estimated 3,800 inmates, up slightly from 3,720 in 
2014 (table 1). From June 2000 to June 2015, the overall rated 
capacity grew at twice the rate (up 83%) of the midyear inmate 
population (up 41%). As a result, occupied bed space declined 
from 86% of rated capacity at midyear 2000 to 66% at midyear
2015. When measured relative to the average daily population 
(ADP), the percentage of rated capacity occupied in Indian 
country jails was 58% in June 2014 and 63% in June 2015.
This was down from 75% in June 2004, the first year ADP was 
collected (not shown).

*********************************************
The largest jails accounted for 26% of all 
facilities and held nearly 60% of all inmates 
in Indian country jails
*********************************************

Of the inmates confined in Indian country jails at midyear 2015, 
an estimated 93% (2,340) were held in 56 facilities rated to hold 
25 or more inmates (table 2). At midyear 2015, 58% of the jail 
population was held in 20 facilities rated to hold 50 or more 
inmates. The 20 facilities with a rated capacity of 24 or fewer 
inmates accounted for about a quarter (26%) of all facilities and 
held less than 10% of all inmates in Indian country jails. Among 
all jails, the population ranged from no inmates in Fort Peck 
Transitional Living Unit to 228 inmates in the facility for 
Nisqually Adult Corrections, which held 9% of the total 
population in Indian country jails at midyear 2015. Overall, 
12 facilities accounted for half of the inmate population in 
Indian country jails.

The 20 jails with a rated capacity of 50 or more inmates reported 
a similar use of their bed space at midyear 2015 and on an 
average day in June 2015 (65% each) (figure 2). On their most 
crowded day in June 2015, the 20 largest jails were operating at 
79% of their rated capacity. The bed space utilization rate of 
the 56 facilities that held 49 or fewer inmates varied at midyear 
2015 (67% of rated capacity), on an average day in June 2015 
(59%), and on their most crowded day in June 2015 (93%).

Twenty-six facilities (34%) in 2015 were operating above rated 
capacity on the most crowded day in June, which was similar to 
2014 (table 3). Thirteen facilities were operating above rated 
capacity on the last weekday in June 2015, and 11 were operating 
above rated capacity on an average day in June 2015.

*********************************************
The expected average length of stay in Indian 
country jails increased by a day
*********************************************

During 2015, the 76 Indian country jails admitted an estimated 
9,810 persons, down from 10,460 persons admitted to 79 facilities 
in June 2014 (table 4). Admissions to Indian country jails in 
June 2015 were four times the size of the average daily 
population (2,390), down from five times the size of the average 
daily population in 2014 (2,170). In June 2015, admissions to 
facilities rated to hold from 25 to 49 inmates (4,150) and 50 or 
more inmates (4,410) accounted for nearly 9 in 10 admissions, up 
from 2014 when facilities rated to hold 25 or more inmates 
accounted for about 75% of all admissions.

Overall, admissions declined and the average daily population 
increased, resulting in an increase in expected average length of 
stay (the time held in custody from admission to release) between 
June 2014 (about 6 days) and June 2015 (about 7 days). Facilities 
rated to hold 49 or fewer inmates accounted for the increase in 
the expected average length of stay. Facilities rated to hold 
50 or more inmates reported a decline between midyear 2014 (about 
11.5 days) and midyear 2015 (about 10 days).

*********************************************
An estimated 30% of inmates were held for 
a violent offense each year in the previous 
5 years
*********************************************

Since 2000, the distribution of Indian country jail inmates by 
sex and age has changed. Although males accounted for the largest 
proportion of the inmate population in Indian country jails, the 
percentage of female jail inmates increased from 20% of all 
inmates in 2000 to 25% in 2015 (table 5). The juvenile population, 
defined as those inmates age 17 or younger, declined from 16% in 
2000 to less than 10% in 2013, 2014, and 2015. The distribution 
of inmates by conviction status and offense type also changed. 
After the percentage of convicted inmates peaked in 2009 at 69%, 
it declined steadily each year from 2010 (59%) to 2014 (51%). In 
2015, the percentage of convicted inmates increased to 55%.

Since 2010, about 3 in 10 inmates held in Indian country jails 
have been confined for a violent offense, a decline from 4 in 10 
since peaking in 2007. ***Footnote 2 For 2002, 2004, and 2007 to 
2009 data, see Jails in Indian Country, 2012 (NCJ 242187, BJS 
web, June 2013).*** At midyear 2015, domestic violence (13%) and 
aggravated or simple assault (10%) accounted for 23% of all 
inmates. Inmates held for other violence (6%) and rape or sexual 
assault (2%) accounted for an additional 8% of the jail 
population.

Patterns of decline were also observed among inmates held for 
alcohol- and drug-related offenses. Inmates held for driving 
while intoxicated or driving while under the influence of drugs 
or alcohol declined from 16% of the total inmate population in 
2000 to 7% at midyear 2015. The percentage of inmates held for a 
drug law violation declined from 8% in 2000 to 6% at midyear 
2015. 

In 2013, BJS enhanced the SJIC offense category questionnaire 
item to include burglary, larceny-theft, and public intoxication, 
which allowed for better classification of previously unspecified 
offenses. About 20% of inmates at midyear 2015 were charged with 
public intoxication (17%), burglary (2%), and larceny-theft (1%), 
which was similar to 2013 and 2014.

*********************************************
The number of correctional staff increased 
since 2010
*********************************************

Indian country jails employed an estimated 1,690 persons at 
midyear 2015 (table 6). Each year since 2010, jail operations 
staff accounted for about 7 in 10 personnel. Jail operations 
staff consists of correctional officers and other staff who spend 
more than 50% of their time supervising inmates. The number of 
jail operations staff remained stable from midyear 2013 to 
midyear 2015, but increased 19% from midyear 2010 to midyear 
2015. Overall, the ratio of inmates to jail operations employees 
was about 2 inmates to 1 jail operations employee at midyear 
2015, remaining stable since 2010. An estimated 490 jail 
personnel (29%) in Indian country jails were administrative 
employees; educational staff; technical or professional staff; 
clerical, maintenance, or food service staff; or staff performing 
other job functions.

************************************************
Two reported deaths occurred in Indian country 
jails in the 12-month period ending 
June 30, 2015
*************************************************

Indian country jail authorities reported 10 deaths in custody 
since midyear 2010 (not shown). Two deaths, including one 
suicide, were reported during the 12-month period ending June 30, 
2015. During the same period, 68 facilities reported a total of 
53 attempted suicides. Among the 61 facilities reporting valid 
data on attempted suicide in both 2014 and 2015, 51 inmates in 
2014 and 52 in 2015 attempted suicide. Overall, attempted 
suicides in Indian country jails declined significantly after 
peaking in 2002. (For more information, see Jails in Indian 
Country, 2012, NCJ 242187, BJS web, June 2013.)

***************
Methodology
***************

The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) Annual Survey of Jails in 
Indian Country (SJIC) includes all Indian country correctional 
facilities operated by tribal authorities or the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior. BJS has conducted the 
SJIC annually since 1998, excluding 2005 and 2006. The 2015 
survey collected data about the number of inmates and percentage 
of capacity occupied. Capacity occupied is based on the June 2015 
average daily population (ADP), midyear population, and peak 
population in facilities in June 2015 (appendix table 1). ADP 
is the number of inmates confined each day in June, divided by 
30, midyear count is the number of inmates held on the last 
weekday in June, and peak population is the number of inmates 
held on the day in June in which the custody population of a 
facility was the largest.

Through a cooperative agreement with BJS, Westat, Inc. conducted 
the SJIC that is designed to cover all adult and juvenile jail 
facilities and detention centers in Indian country. The reference 
date for the survey is June 30, 2015.

For this report, Indian country includes reservations, pueblos, 
rancherias, and other appropriate areas (18 U.S.C. § 1151). 
Indian country is a statutory term that includes all lands within 
an Indian reservation, dependent Indian communities, and Indian 
trust allotments (18 U.S.C. § 1151). Courts interpret Section 
1151 to include all lands held in trust for tribes or their 
members. (See United States v. Roberts, 185 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 
1999)).

Tribal authority to imprison American Indian offenders had been 
limited to 1 year per offense by statute (25 U.S.C. § 1302), a 
$5,000 fine, or both. On July 29, 2010, the Tribal Law and Order 
Act of 2010 was signed into law, expanding tribal court sentencing 
authority. As a result, offenders may serve potentially lengthier 
sentences (up to 3 years) in Indian country correctional 
facilities (P.L. 111-211, H.R. 725, 124 Stat. 2258).

Tribal law enforcement agencies act as first responders to both 
felony and misdemeanor crimes. For most of Indian country, the 
federal government provides felony law enforcement concerning 
crimes by or against American Indians and Alaska Natives. Certain 
areas of Indian country are under Public Law 83-280, as amended 
(commonly referred to as Public Law 280). Public Law 280 
conferred jurisdiction over Indian country to certain states and 
suspended enforcement of the Major Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 1153) 
and the General Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 1152) in those areas. 
Indian tribes retain concurrent jurisdiction to enforce laws in 
Indian country where Public Law 280 applies.

Annually, BJS updates its existing roster of jails in Indian 
country. BJS obtains data from administrators of Indian country 
jails by faxed questionnaires and through follow-up phone calls 
and facsimiles. The survey universe and response rates have 
changed over time. During the 11-year period, many facilities 
have closed or been constructed (table 7). In some cases, 
facilities do not respond to the survey or report incomplete 
data. For comparison over time, BJS imputed data on inmate 
populations for facilities that did not respond to the surveys, 
including seven in 2004, four in 2007, two in 2013, five in 2014, 
and seven in 2015. In 2015, imputations for the midyear jail 
populations, ADP, peak population, and admission during the month 
of June used the most recent available data. The imputed value 
for the peak population for five facilities during June 
2015 was based on their midyear population or ADP in June 2015, 
whichever was greater.

Expected length of stay for 2015
**********************************

The stock-flow ratio method was used to measure the expected 
average length of stay for inmates held during June 2015. 
Stock--average daily population during June 2015 = 2,390
Flow--inmate admissions during June 2015 = 9,810
Stock-flow ratio in June 2015 = 0.244 (2,390/9,810 = 0.244)
Expected length of stay in days (the average number of days 
held in custody from admission to release) = 7.3 days 
(0.244 × 30 days = 7.3).
