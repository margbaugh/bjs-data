Special Report

Disabilities Among Prison and Jail Inmates, 2011–12

Jennifer Bronson, Ph.D., and Laura M. Maruschak, BJS 
Statisticians Marcus Berzofsky, Dr.P.H., RTI International

In 2011–12, about 3 in 10 state and federal prisoners and 4 in 
10 local jail inmates reported having at least one disability. 
Among prison and jail inmates, females were more likely to 
report a disability than males (figure 1). About 40% of females 
and 31% of males in prison and 49% of females and 39% of males 
in jail reported a disability. In this report, disability types 
include hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and 
independent living, which refers to the ability to navigate 
daily life schedules, activities, and events without 
assistance. 

This report uses data from the 2011–12 National Inmate Survey 
(NIS-3) to describe the prevalence of disabilities among prison 
and jail inmates. (See Limitations of the survey data.) Data 
from the 2012 American Community Survey (ACS) were used to 
compare the incarcerated populations to the 
noninstitutionalized general population. The general population 
was standardized to match the prison population and to match 
the jail population by sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin. By 
standardizing the general population to the inmate population, 
BJS controls for differences in the distributions of sex, age, 
race, and Hispanic origin, which  associated with disabilities. 
Standardization removes the effects that these characteristics 
may have on a population when comparing the prevalence of 
disabilities between the incarcerated populations and the 
general population. However, it does not remove the effect 
that other factors may have regarding both incarceration 
status and general health status, such as poverty and unsafe 
neighborhoods. This report details the prevalence of six specific 
disability types, highlights important differences in each by 
demographic characteristics, and assesses the prevalence of 
disabilities with other health problems, such as chronic conditions 
and infectious diseases***1,2 Chronic conditions include cancer, 
high blood pressure, stroke-related problems, diabetes, heart-
related problems, kidney-related problems, arthritis, asthma, 
and cirrhosis of the liver.*** ***Footnote 2 Infectious 
diseases include tuberculosis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or a 
sexually transmitted (excluding HIV/AIDS)***., All 
prevalence data were self-reported by prison and jail inmates.

Highlights
************

This report presents prevalence estimates of disabilities among 
prison and jail inmates and characteristics of those inmates 
with a disability. Estimates of the prevalence of disabilities 
include inmates who reported at least one of six specific types:  
hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and independent 
living.

* An estimated 32% of prisoners and 40% of jail inmates 
reported having at least one disability.

* Were nearly 3 times more likely and jail inmates were 
more than 4 times more likely than the general population 
to report having at least one disability.

* About 2 in 10 prisoners and 3 in 10 jail inmates reported having 
a cognitive disability, the most common reported disability in 
each population.

* Female were more likely than males to report having a 
cognitive disability, but were equally likely to report 
having each of the other five disabilities.

* Non-Hispanic white prisoners (37%) and prisoners of two or 
more races (42%) were more likely than non-Hispanic black 
prisoners (26%) to report having at least one disability.

* More than half of prisoners (54%) and jail inmates (53%) with 
a disability reported a current co-occurring chronic condition.

* Compared to those without a disability, prisoners with a 
disability were 4 times more likely and jail inmates with a 
disability were 2.5 times more likely to report past 30-day 
serious psychological distress.

* Thirty-three percent of prisoners and 47% of jail inmates 
with a cognitive disability reported past 30-day serious 
psychological distress, compared to 11% of prisoners and 24% 
of jail inmates with a disability other than cognitive.

******************************************************
********************************
Limitations of the survey data
********************************

There is no universally accepted definition of disability. 
This report uses six questions to measure disability that were 
modeled after the 2012 American Community Survey (ACS), conducted 
by the U.S. Census Bureau. These questions were included in the Bureau 
of Justice Statistics (BJS) National Inmate Survey, 2011–12 (NIS-
3): 
 
Hearing--Are you deaf or do you have serious difficulty 
hearing?

Vision--Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing 
even when wearing glasses?

Cognitive--Because of a physical, mental, or emotional problem, 
do you have serious difficulty concentrating, remembering, or 
making decisions?

Ambulatory--Do you have serious difficulty walking or climbing 
stairs?

Self-care--Do you have difficulty dressing or bathing?

Independent living--Because of a physical, mental, or emotional 
problem, do you have difficulty doing activities on your own, 
such as going to meal time, going outside, working in or 
outside of this facility, going to classes, or attending 
programs?

There are several limitations of these data. The etiology (or 
cause) of an inmate’s disability is unknown, as the survey was 
not designed to assess whether a disability is congenital, 
genetic, or biological; illness or disease related, or caused 
by something in the environment (e.g., a gunshot wound). As 
such, the temporal relationship between disability onset and 
incarceration is unknown. For this reason, it is inappropriate 
to infer causation or correlation between disability status and 
criminality.

The survey does not ask how often or how severely the 
disability limits or impairs an inmate’s ability to function 
(e.g., daily struggles with everything or occasional flare-
ups). The data are self-reported and were not verified against 
medical records or diagnostic data. 

There is an environmental or social component to disabilities, 
which can frame how individuals view themselves and their 
impairments. For example, the effects of some impairments can 
be minimized with the proper medical treatment and 
accommodations (e.g., a cane). With the proper accommodations 
and support, inmates may or may not consider themselves to have 
a disability.

BJS’s prevalence estimates may be underestimates because some 
inmates may have been unable to participate in the NIS-3 due to 
serious cognitive limitations that precluded them from fully 
understanding the informed consent procedures or the survey 
questions. In addition, some inmates with a particular 
disability (e.g., a hearing disability) may have had a harder 
time completing the survey than inmates without a disability.
******************************************************

***************************************
Inmates were more likely than persons 
in the general population to report 
having a disability
***************************************

When compared to the standardized general population, both 
prison and jail inmates were more likely to report having a 
disability. About 32% of prisoners reported a disability, 
compared to 11% of persons in the general population (table 1). 
Prisoners were more likely than persons in the general 
population to report each specific disability type except for a 
self-care disability, while jail inmates were more likely to 
report each specific disability. Prisoners were about 2 times 
more likely than persons in the general population to report 
independent living, ambulatory, and hearing disabilities; about 
3 times more likely to report a visual disability; and 4 times 
more likely to report a cognitive disability. Forty percent of 
jail inmates, compared to 9% of those in the general 
population, reported having a disability (table 2). When 
compared to the general population, jail inmates were about 2.5 
times more likely to report an ambulatory and independent 
living disability, more than 3 times more likely to report a 
visual and hearing disability, and 6.5 times more likely to 
report a cognitive disability.

***************************************
Cognitive disability was the most 
commonly reported disability among 
inmates
***************************************

About 2 in 10 prisoners and 3 in 10 jail inmates reported a 
cognitive disability, the most common disability reported by 
each population (see textbox). Among prison and jail inmates, 
an ambulatory disability was the second most common disability 
(10% each). Among prisoners, 7% reported an independent living 
disability, 7% reported a vision disability, 6% reported a 
hearing disability, and 2% reported a self-care disability. 
Among jail inmates, 9% reported an independent living disability, 
7% reported a vision disability, 7% reported a hearing disability, 
and 3% reported a self-care disability

********************************************
***************************************
Differences between cognitive 
disabilities and mental disorders
***************************************

A cognitive disability is a broad term used to describe a 
variety of medical conditions affecting different types of 
mental tasks, such as problem solving, reading comprehension, 
attention, and remembering. A cognitive disability is not the 
same as a mental disorder, although they often co-occur and a 
mental disorder can be considered a disability as well. The 
main differences are-- 

* symptoms of a mental disorder may be cyclical, temporary, or 
episodic whereas symptoms of a cognitive disability are 
constant and permanent

* symptoms of a mental disorder may be controlled or eliminated 
by medications, and a person can usually live a normal life 
with the proper mental health care, but medications cannot 
fully restore, repair, or alleviate cognitive limitations

* symptoms of a mental disorder may include disturbances in 
perceptions, emotions, and thought processes such as 
hallucinations or delusions, which are not symptoms associated 
with most cognitive disabilities. 

Examples of cognitive disabilities include Down syndrome, 
autism, dementia, attention deficit disorder, learning 
disorders, intellectual disabilities, or traumatic brain 
injury. Examples of mental disorders include depression, 
anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia.
*********************************************

***************************************
About 13% of prisoners and 16% of jail 
inmates reported having multiple 
disabilities
***************************************

About 19% of prisoners reported having only one disability, 
compared to 24% of jail inmates (table 3). An estimated 13% 
of prisoners and 16% of jail inmates reported having multiple 
disabilities. Eight percent of prisoners and 10% of jail inmates 
reported two disabilities, and 5% of prisoners and 6% of jail 
inmates reported having 3 or more disabilities. 

***************************************
Female inmates were more likely than 
male inmates to report having a 
disability
***************************************

An estimated 40% of females and 31% of males in prison reported 
a disability (table 4). More female prisoners (30%) reported a 
cognitive disability than male prisoners (19%). Female and male 
prisoners were equally likely to report having hearing, vision, 
ambulatory, self-care, or independent living disabilities.

Among jail inmates, 49% of females reported a disability, 
compared to 39% of males (table 5). Male and female jail 
inmates reported similar percentages of having a hearing 
disability (7% for males and 6% for females), a self-care 
disability (3% and 4%), and an independent living disability 
(9% and 10%). Male jail inmates (8%) were more likely than 
female jail inmates (5%) to report a vision disability, but 
females were more likely than males to report an ambulatory or 
cognitive disability. Among females in jail, nearly 14% 
(compared to 9% of males) reported an ambulatory disability and 
about 41% (compared to 29% of males) reported a cognitive 
disability.

***************************************
Non-Hispanic black and Hispanic inmates 
were less likely than non-Hispanic 
whites to report a disability
***************************************

Among prisoners, 37% of non-Hispanic whites and 42% of persons 
of two or more races reported at least one disability, compared 
to 26% of non-Hispanic blacks. Among jail inmates, 40% of 
whites and 55% of persons of two or more races reported having 
at least one disability, compared to 35% of blacks. Hispanic 
prisoners (28%) and jail inmates (38%) were as likely as blacks 
to report having at least one disability. There were no 
differences in prevalence of vision and self-care disabilities 
among prison and jail inmates across race and Hispanic origin.

A larger percentage of prisoners of two or more races (27%) and 
white prisoners (23%) reported cognitive disabilities than 
black (17%) or Hispanic prisoners (15%). Among jail inmates, 
nearly the same percentage (about 30%) of white, black, and 
Hispanic offenders reported a cognitive disability.

*****************************************
Older inmates were more likely to report 
*****************************************

Forty-four percent of prisoners and 60% of jail inmates age 50 
or older reported a disability, compared to 27% of prisoners 
and 34% of jail inmates ages 18 to 24. Older prison and jail 
inmates reported higher rates of all disabilities with the 
exception of cognitive disabilities. All age groups were 
equally likely to report this disability.

Compared to those ages 18 to 24, prison and jail inmates age 50 
and older were 6 times more likely to report having a hearing 
disability, 4 to 5 times more likely to report a vision 
disability, and more than twice as likely to report an 
independent living disability. An ambulatory disability was 
reported by 27% of prisoners age 50 or older, those ages 
35 to 49, and those ages 18 to 24. Among jail inmates, 
an ambulatory disability those ages 35 to 49 and of those 
ages 18 to 24.

***************************************
More than half of inmates with a 
disability reported a chronic condition
***************************************

Prison and jail inmates with a disability were more likely to 
have a co-occurring chronic condition than those without a 
disability. More than half of prisoners (54%) and jail inmates 
(53%) with a disability reported a chronic condition, compared 
to more than a third (35%) of prisoners and nearly a third 
(30%) of jail inmates without a disability (table 6).

A greater percentage of inmates with a disability reported ever 
having an infectious disease than those without a disability. 
An estimated 32% of prisoners with a disability and 21% of 
those without a disability reported ever having an infectious 
disease. Among jail inmates, 26% with a disability and 18% 
without a disability reported ever having an infectious 
disease.

Inmates with a disability were as likely to be obese or 
morbidly obese as those without a disability. Measures of 
obesity and morbidly obese were calculated using the body mass 
index. (See Methodology.) were obese or morbidly obese.

Prison and jail inmates with a disability were more likely to 
report past 30-day serious psychological distress (SPD) than 
inmates without a disability. (See Methodology.) Among those 
with a cognitive disability, a third of those in prison (33%) 
and nearly half of those in jail (47%) reported past 30-day 
SPD, compared to 11% of prisoners and 24% of jail inmates with 
a disability other than a cognitive disability (figure 2). 
Prisoners (6%) and jail inmates (17%) without a disability had 
the lowest rates of past 30-day SPD. In comparison, the rate of 
past 30-day SPD among the general population was 4% when 
adjusted to the sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin profile for 
prisoners and 5% when adjusted for jail inmates (appendix table 
8)***Footnote 3 Data are from the 2009–12 National Survey of 
Drug Use and Health, conducted by the Substance Abuse and 
Mental Health Services Administration***.

Methodology
*****************

National Inmate Survey
************************

The National Inmate Survey, 2011–12 (NIS-3) was conducted in 
233 state and federal prisons and 358 jails between February 
2011 and May 2012. The data were collected by RTI International 
under a cooperative agreement with the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (BJS). The NIS-3 included two questionnaires--a 
survey of sexual victimization and a survey of mental and 
physical health (including disabilities), past drug and alcohol 
use, and treatment for substance abuse. Inmates were randomly 
assigned to receive one of the questionnaires so that at the 
time of the interview the content of the survey remained 
unknown to facility staff and the interviewers.

A total of 91,177 inmates age 18 or older participated in NIS-
3, including 38,251 inmates in state and federal prisons and 
52,926 inmates in jail. The interviews, which averaged 35 
minutes, used computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) 
and audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) data 
collection methods. For approximately the first 2 minutes, 
survey interviewers used CAPI to obtain an inmate’s background 
information and date of admission to the facility. For the 
remainder of the interview, respondents interacted with a 
computer-administered questionnaire using a touchscreen and 
synchronized audio instructions delivered via headphones. 
Respondents completed the ACASI portion of the interview in 
private, with the interviewer either leaving the room or moving 
away from the computer.

A shorter paper questionnaire was made available for inmates 
who were unable to come to the private interviewing room or 
interact with the computer. The paper form was completed by 733 
state and federal prisoners and 255 jail inmates. Inmates who 
completed the paper form were not asked about their physical 
health, mental health, past drug and alcohol use, or treatment 
for substance abuse. Additional information on the methodology 
used for selecting facilities and inmates can be found in the 
report, Use of Restrictive Housing in U.S. Prisons and Jails, 
2011–12 (NCJ 249209, BJS web, October 2015).

Measurement of disability
*******************************

The disability module was administered to participating inmates 
in the NIS-3 for one of two reasons--

* to ensure that the length of the sexual victimization survey 
was similar for all participating inmates

* as part of the alternative survey on mental and physical 
health, past drug and alcohol use, and treatment for substance 
abuse.
 
Among inmates who received the sexual victimization survey (90% 
of inmates surveyed), a brief disability module was 
administered to respondents who completed the core sexual 
victimization survey in 45 minutes. Based on the time criteria, 
31,256 adult prisoners (84% of the who would have been administered 
the disability module) and 47,827 adult jail inmates (92% of the 
jail inmates who would have been administered the disability module) 
completed the disability module.

The module was administered through ACASI, asked inmates about 
the types of disabilities they have, including vision, hearing, 
ambulatory, cognitive, self-care, or independent living 
disabilities.The entire ACASI questionnaire (listed as the 
National Inmate Survey-3) is available on the BJS website.

Nonresponse bias analysis
*******************************

Bias occurs when the estimated prevalence of an outcome is 
different from the actual prevalence of the outcome for a given 
facility. One potential source of bias is nonresponse. For each 
survey in the NIS-3, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted 
to determine whether inmates who did not receive the disability 
module due to the time constraints built into the survey were 
different from inmates who did receive the disability module. 
For the sexual victimization survey, the nonresponse bias 
analysis included, by facility type, a comparison of an 
inmate’s response status to each of the key measures in the 
disability module by their sexual victimization status and the 
language of their interview (English or Spanish). For the 
alternative survey respondents, the nonresponse bias analysis 
included, by facility type, a comparison of an inmate’s 
response status to each of the measures in the disability 
module.

Findings from the nonresponse bias analysis for respondents 
to the sexual victimization survey included--

* For both prisons and jails, inmates who responded in Spanish 
were significantly less likely to receive the disability 
module. Among prison respondents, 8.9% of those who did not 
receive the disability module responded in Spanish, compared 
to 3.6% of those who received the disability module after 
responding to the survey in Spanish (p < .05). Among jail 
respondents, 18.7% of those who did not receive the disability 
module responded in Spanish, compared to 3.8% of those who 
received the disability module after responding to the survey 
in Spanish (p < .05).

* For both prisons and jails, inmates who reported a sexual 
victimization were significantly less likely to receive the 
disability module. Among prison respondents, 25.1% of inmates 
who reported a sexual victimization did not receive the 
disability module, compared to 16.9% of inmates who did not 
report a sexual victimization (p < .05). Among jail respondents, 
19.9% of inmates who reported a sexual victimization did not 
receive the disability module, compared to 9.6% of inmates 
who did not report a victimization (p < .05).

Findings from the nonresponse bias analysis for respondents 
to the alternative survey included--

* For both prisons and jails, nearly all inmates responded 
to the disability module (99.5% responded in both prisons 
and jails).

* No statistical differences between Spanish and English 
respondents were found.

For the alternative survey, the results of the nonresponse 
bias analyses indicated that a weight adjustment could properly 
correct for potential bias among respondents to the full 
disability module. For the sexual victimization survey, the 
results of the nonresponse bias analyses determined that a 
weight adjustment may not fully compensate for the potential 
bias among prisoners who responded to the disability module. 
Therefore, even though the potential bias among jail inmates 
was lower, to be consistent in the analyses, only responses 
from the alternative survey were used.

Weighting and nonresponse adjustments
**************************************

Responses from interviewed inmates were weighted to produce 
national-level estimates. Each interviewed inmate was assigned 
an initial weight corresponding to the inverse of the 
probability of selection within each sampled facility. A series 
of adjustment factors was applied to the initial weight to 
minimize potential bias due to nonresponse and to provide 
national estimates. For the analysis of the disability module, 
these adjustments were one of two types:

* adjustments to account for survey nonresponse

* adjustments to account for coverage error.

Methods for adjusting for survey nonresponse and coverage error 
are described in detail in Sexual Victimization in Prisons and 
Jails as Reported by Inmates, 2011–12 (NCJ 241399, BJS web, May 
2013). Once adjusted weights were developed to account for 
survey nonresponse, an additional weighting adjustment was 
conducted to account for the potential bias induced by coverage 
error. Because all respondents who were randomized to the 
alternative survey received the disability module, no 
additional module-specific adjustments were necessary. For each 
inmate, the adjustments were based on a generalized exponential 
model, developed by Folsom and Singh (2002), and applied to the 
sexual victimization survey respondents***Footnote 4 Folsom, 
Jr., R.E., & Singh, A.C. (2002). The generalized exponential 
model for sampling weight calibration for extreme values, 
nonresponse, and poststratification. Proceedings of the 
American Statistical Association, Survey Research Methods 
Section, pp. 598–603***.

The survey weight adjustments were benchmarked totals designed 
to make national-level estimates for the total number of 
inmates age 18 or older who were held in jail at midyear 2011 
or in prison at yearend 2011. These benchmark totals 
represented the estimated number of inmates by sex, from BJS’s 
2011 Annual Survey of Jails and 2011 National Prisoner 
Statistics. The national estimates for state prisons were 
1,154,600 adult males and 83,400 adult females; for federal 
prisons, 190,600 adult males and 13,200 adult females; and for 
jails (with an average daily population of 6 or more inmates), 
628,620 adult males and 91,551 adult females.

Standard errors and tests 
of significance
*******************************

As with any survey, the NIS-3 estimates are subject to error 
arising from sampling rather than using a complete enumeration 
of the population of adult inmates in prison and jail. For each 
outcome, the estimated sampling error varies by the size 
of the estimate, the number of completed interviews, and the 
intra-cluster correlation of the outcome within facilities. A 
common way to express this sampling variability is to construct 
a 95% confidence interval around each survey estimate. 
Typically, multiplying the standard error by 1.96 and then 
adding or subtracting the result from the estimate produces the 
confidence interval. This interval expresses the range of 
values that could result among 95% of the different samples 
that could be drawn.

To facilitate the analysis, rather than provide the detailed 
estimates for every standard error, differences in the 
estimates of sexual victimization for subgroups in these tables 
have been tested and notated for significance at the 95% 
confidence level.  In all tables providing detailed 
comparisons, statistically significant differences at the 95% 
confidence level or greater have been designated with two 
asterisks (**).

Calculation of body mass index
*******************************

Body mass index (BMI) is a measurement of body fat based on 
height and weight and applies to adult men and women. BMI can 
be used to determine if a person is underweight (18.5 or less), 
normal weight (18.5 to 24.9), overweight (25.0 to 29.9), obese 
(30.0 to 39.9), or morbidly obese (40 or greater). In the NIS-
3, BMI was based on the following formula provided by the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: BMI = weight 
(pounds) / (height (inches))2 x 703.

Screening for serious 
psychological distress
*******************************

To determine whether inmates had an indicator of a current 
mental health problem, the NIS-3 included the K6 screening 
scale for psychological distress. The K6 scale is a measure 
of past 30-day, nonspecific serious psychological distress (SPD) 
and is not a diagnostic tool. It was developed by Kessler and 
colleagues to estimate the prevalence of serious mental illness 
in noninstitutional settings and as a tool to identify possible 
cases of psychiatric disorder. It has been used widely in 
epidemiological surveys in the United States and other 
countries including with prison populations. The K6 consists 
of six questions that ask inmates to report how often during the 
past 30 days they felt--

* nervous

* hopeless

* restless or fidgety

* so depressed that nothing could cheer them up

* everything was an effort

* worthless.

The response options were (1) all of the time, (2) most of the 
time, (3) some of the time, (4) a little of the time, and (5) 
none of the time. Following Kessler, the responses were recoded 
from 4 to 0, with 4 assigned to “all of the time” and 0 
assigned to “none of the time.” A summary scale combining the 
responses from all six items, with a range of 0 to 24, was then 
produced. The summary score was then reduced to three categories: 
0 to 7 indicated no mental illness, 8 to 12 indicated an 
anxiety-mood disorder, and 13 or higher indicated SPD. The NIS-3 
may produce underestimates because some inmates with serious 
mental illness may have been unable to participate in the NIS-3 
due to not fully understanding the informed-consent procedures 
or the survey questions.

Measurements in the general 
population
*******************************

General population estimates in this report come from one 
of
two sources:

*the American Community Survey (ACS), 2012

*the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 2009–12.

The ACS contains disability information on persons age 18 years 
or older living in the United States. Persons living in 
institutionalized and noninstitutionalized group quarters were 
excluded so that the estimates best represented the general 
population. The survey year 2012 of the ACS was used in this 
analysis. Statistical tests comparing the disability rates 
measured in the NIS-3 and the ACS are presented in tables 1 and 
2. The ACS asks the following disability questions:

Hearing--Is this person deaf or does he/she have serious 
difficulty hearing?

Vision--Is this person blind or does he/she have serious 
difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?

Cognitive--Because of a physical, mental, or emotional problem, 
does this person have difficulty remembering, concentrating, or 
making decisions?

Ambulatory--Does this person have serious difficulty walking or 
climbing stairs?

Self-care--Does this person have difficulty bathing or 
dressing?

Independent living--Because of a physical, mental, or emotional 
problem, does this person have difficulty doing errands alone 
such as visiting a doctor’s office or shopping?

The NSDUH contains information on persons in the general 
population with past 30-day SPD. To be most comparable to the 
NIS-3 while ensuring reasonable precision, the survey years 
2009 through 2012 of NSDUH were used in this analysis. The 
prevalence of those with past 30-day SPD in the general 
population standardized to the prison and the jail populations 
in the NIS-3--based on sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin--is 
presented in appendix table 8.

Because the demographic makeup of the general population is 
different than that of the inmate population (e.g., the general 
population is older, more white, and more female), general 
population rates were standardized to the inmate population 
(i.e., the prison population for table 1, the jail population 
for table 2, and for both populations for appendix table 8) to 
assess the differences between comparable populations. 
Standardization calibrates the weights of one of the 
populations to the distribution of the other based on a set of 
specified characteristics.

Standardized estimates were computed in SUDAAN using its 
standardization options in PROC DESCRIPT. For this analysis, 
the general population was standardized to inmate population 
based on sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin. The standardized 
general population estimates for disabilities can be 
interpreted as the estimate of disabilities among the general 
population, if the general population had the same sex, age, 
race, and Hispanic origin distribution as the prison and jail 
populations.
