On June 30, 2003, a total of 70 jails, confinement
facilities, detention centers, and other correctional
facilities supervised 1,908 persons in Indian country,
down 8% from the previous year. At midyear 2002,
2,080 persons had been under the supervision of jails
in Indian country.

At midyear 2003 Indian country facilities held 1,826
inmates, and jail authorities supervised 82 offenders
in community programs. A year earlier, 2,006 were
held, and 74 were in community programs. New jail
admissions rose 4% from 11,822 in June 2002 to
12,243 in June 2003.  

The 70 facilities had a rated capacity to hold 2,222
persons, up 1.6% since 2002. On June 30, 2003, the
jails were operating at 82% of capacity, down  from
92% at midyear 2002. On an  average day in June
2003, the jails were operating at 71% of capacity; 
on their peak day in the month, at 13% over capacity.
The number of inmates on the peak day in June
decreased 8% from the previous year. 

At midyear 2003 more than a third of the offenders in
Indian country jails were held for a violent offense,
17% specifically for domestic violence. Eleven percent
of all offenders (207) were being held for DWI/DUI.

These data are based on the 2003 Survey of Jails in
Indian Country (SJIC). The survey includes all Indian
country correctional facilities operated by tribal
authorities or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), 
U.S. Department of the Interior.

Tribes retain jurisdiction over many crimes by
American Indians and Alaska Natives in Indian
country

Thirty-three States contain approximately 300 Indian
land areas or reservations. Generally the local
governing authority on Indian lands is a tribal
government or council. Jurisdiction over crimes in
Indian country depends on several factors, including
the identity of the victim and the offender, the 
severity of the crime, and where the crime was 
committed. (See box below.) Tribal authority to 
sentence offenders is limited to 1 year of 
imprisonment and a $5,000 fine or both (25 U.S.C. 
sec 1302(7)). 

City or county jails held nearly 4 times as many
American Indians as jails in Indian country. (American
Indians in this report include Alaska Natives.) At
midyear 2003 local jails held an estimated 7,200
American Indians, some of whom may have been
adjudicated by a tribal criminal justice system and
housed in jails under contracts with tribal, city, 
or county governments. Overall, State, Federal, 
local, and tribal authorities were supervising 53,329
American Indians. Most were under community supervision 
(29,705).

A total of 23,624 American Indians were in custody at
midyear 2003, most of whom were held in State
prisons (12,438).

On July 1, 2003, 2,786,652 American Indians and Alaska 
Natives lived in the Unites States (U.S. Census Bureau, 
National Population Estimates, table SC-EST2003-04). 
American Indians account for under 1% of the U.S. 
resident population and 1% of those in custody of 
jails or prisons.

At midyear 2003 tribal, Federal, and State prison or
jail authorities held 848 American Indians per 100,000
Indians, an incarceration rate based on 23,624 in
custody and 2.8 million residents. The rate for
American Indians was about 19% higher than the
overall national rate, 715 persons of all races 
per 100,000 U.S. Residents.

Indian country jail population declined 
9% between July 2002 and June 2003 

At midyear 2003 jails in Indian country supervised
1,908 persons, down from 2,080 in 2002. Nearly all
(1,826) were held in jails, with an additional 82
persons being supervised in the community. The
number of inmates in custody decreased 9% from the
previous year, when 2,006 inmates were being
housed.

Persons under community supervision increased 11%
(82 in 2003 up from 74 in 2002). Most(61%)persons
under community supervision were serving their
sentence of confinement on the weekend prior to 
June 30, 2004. 

Overall, the number of persons held in Indian country
jails fluctuated between June 2002 and June 2003.
Although the population decreased during the 12
months, June of each year was among the months with 
the largest custody counts. In 2003 the smallest
jail inmate population occurred in April -- based on 
51 jails and excluding 19 facilities unable to report
complete data. 

93% of confined inmates held for misdemeanors

On June 30, 2003, jails in Indian country held 1,025
convicted offenders and 800 inmates who were
unconvicted or awaiting trial. Fifty-six percent of 
those jailed in 2003 were convicted, down from 57% 
at midyear 2002 and 61% at midyear 2000.

At midyear 2003, 1,700 inmates were being held for a
misdemeanor, down from 1,725 at midyear 2002. Fifty-
eight inmates were in jail for a felony, down from 
107 in 2002. Two inmates were being held for the 
Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Sixty-
six inmates were being held for the other reasons, 
including detoxification, status offenses, State bench 
warrants, civil traffic violations, violations of 
condition of release, and special holds.

Half of the inmates held for a violent 
offense charged with domestic violence

At midyear 2003, 635 inmates (35% of all inmates)were 
being held for a violent offense, primarily Indian-on-
Indian crime. Of these, 315 (17% of all inmates) were 
confined for domestic violence. Overall, 11% of inmates 
at midyear 2003 were confined for driving while 
intoxicated or driving under the influence of alcohol 
or drugs, unchanged from 2002. Approximately 8% of 
inmates (143) were being held for a drug law violation, 
up from 6% (126) in 2002.  

At midyear 2003 Indian country jails held 1,546 
adults, 81% of whom were males and 19% females.
Juveniles (persons under age 18) accounted for 15%
of the total custody population. Nearly 64% of
juveniles were males; 36% were females. At midyear 
2003, 5 juveniles were being held as adults, down 
from 11 at midyear 2002 and 22 in 2001. 

Between June 1 and June 30, 2003, 12,243 persons
were admitted to jails in Indian country, a 4% 
increase over the same period in 2002. Since 1998 
new admissions have increased 37%.

177 suicide attempts and 3 deaths reported during
the 12 months ending June 30, 2003

Three deaths were reported by jail authorities between 
July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2003. Two inmates committed 
suicide. During the 12-month period, 177 inmates 
attempted suicide, down from 282 in 2002. In the last 
5 years, the number of admissions rose 37%. The annual 
number of attempted suicides increased 33% (from 133 
to 177).

The 10 largest jails held 43% of 
inmates in Indian country

On June 30, 2003, the 10 largest jails in Indian
country housed 779 inmates. Combined, the 10
facilities had a rated capacity to hold 598 inmates, 
or 27% of the total rated capacity of all facilities 
in Indian country. Seventy-nine percent (615) of the 
inmates in the 10 largest jails were confined in 7 
facilities in Arizona. 

Gila River Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, 
Tohono O'odham Detention Center, and Hopi Rehabilitation 
Center each held over 100 inmates. White Mountain Apache 
Police Department which held 60 inmates at midyear 2002, 
held 91 at midyear 2003.

On June 30, 2003, the number of inmates at Tohono
O'odham Detention Center was more than 3 times its
operating capacity. Salt River Department of
Corrections was operating below its rated capacity
(84%). 

64% of jails housed fewer 
than 25 inmates

Forty-five jails in Indian country housed fewer than 25
inmates on June 30, 2003. Eighteen facilities reported
fewer than 10 inmates. Twenty-seven facilities held 10
to 24 inmates, 17 facilities held 25 to 49, and 8
facilities held 50 or more inmates. Three facilities 
each held 100 or more inmates, up from 2 facilities 
at midyear 2002. 

Indian country jails operated 
at 113% of capacity on peak 
day in June 2003 

Combined, the 70 facilities had a rated capacity to
hold 2,222 persons, a 1.6% increase from the previous 
year. Jails in Indian country were operating at 82% 
of capacity on June 30, 2003, down from 92% at midyear 
2002. On their peak day in June 2003, jails were 
holding 2,513 inmates, and operating at 113% of 
capacity. Since 2001 the number of inmates has
decreased by 5% on their peak day in June, while
capacity has increased by 3%. 

Most inmates in Indian country jails were held in 
units occupied by more than one person. At midyear 
2003, 78% of all inmates were held in cellsdesigned 
for multiple occupants; 8% were double bunked in single
cells; 1% were housed in areas not originally intended
for confinement, and 3% were in holding areas or
"drunk tanks." Ten percent of all inmates were housed
in single cells or rooms.

Thirty-five facilities were operating above 100% of
capacity in June 2003, down from 42 the previous
year (appendix table 1, page 6). Sixteen jails were
operating at over 150% of capacity on their peak day
in June 2003, down from 19 in 2002. Arizona (4) and
South Dakota (4) had the most facilities above 150%
of capacity, followed by New Mexico (3), Montana (2),
North Dakota (1), Oregon (1), and Wyoming (1). At
least 15 jails each year have operated above 150% of
capacity on their most crowded day in June since
introducing the survey in 1998.

The Fort Berthold facility in North Dakota reported 
the highest occupancy rate on their peak day in June
(456%), up from 400% in 2002. It housed 41 inmates
on the peak day in June 2003, with a rated capacity 
to hold 9 inmates. Three other facilities reported
operating at over 300%: Crow Police Department in
Montana (429%), Tohono O'odham Detention Center
in Arizona (341%), and Pine Ridge Correctional
Facility in South Dakota (314%).

Since 1998 four facilities have operated above 150%
each year: Fort Berthold Agency, Crow Police
Department, Pine Ridge Correctional Facility, and
Tohono O'odham Detention Center.  

Small facilities reported the highest 
occupancy rates 

Nine facilities with a rated capacity to hold fewer 
than 10 inmates reported the highest occupancy rates
(182%) on their peak day in June 2003. Occupancy
was 140% of capacity in jails rated to hold 10 to 24
inmates, 123% in jails rated to hold 25 to 49, and 
86% of capacity for those rated to hold 50 or more 
inmates.
 
7 facilities under court order or consent 
decree for the  second year in a row

The Navajo Department of Corrections in Chinle was
under order to hold no more than 32 inmates. Six jails
were under multiple court orders or consent decrees
to limit the number of inmates they can house and for
conditions of inmate confinement. Six facilities were
ordered to detain inmates under humane conditions:
Wind River Police Department in Wyoming and
Navajo Department of Corrections in Kayenta
(administratively imposed), Tuba City, Window Rock
(reported on June 29, 2001), Crownpoint, and
Shiprock.

One facility completed construction 
since July 1, 2002

Among all facilities, 69 reported the year in which the
original construction was completed. The original year
of construction ranged from 1929 at the Fort Hall
Police Department in Idaho, to 2003 at the Gila River
Juvenile Detention and Rehabilitation Center. Overall
at midyear 2003, jails in Indian country had an
average age of 24 years.

Since the time of original construction, 43 facilities
have received major renovations. Twenty-three
facilities were renovated between 1982 and 1999.
Twenty facilities were renovated after 1999: 2 in 
2000, 7 in 2001, 5 in 2002, and 6 in 2003.  

Jails employed 1,992 
persons at midyear 2003

Indian country jails employed 1,992 persons on June
30, 2003, including payroll, nonpayroll, and contract
staff. About 34% (680) of reported functions for all
employees were jail operations staff (correctional
officers and other staff who spend more than 50% of
their time supervising inmates). Jails in Indian 
country also employed an estimated 190 administrative
employees, 280 technical or professional staff, and
180 clerical, maintenance, or food service staff. In
addition 650 employees (about 33%) were classified
as field operations staff, including patrol officers 
and other staff who spend more than 50% of their time 
in the field. 

Overall, there were approximately 2.6 inmates for
every jail operations employee at midyear 2003, up
from 2.5 at midyear 2002. There were 5.6 inmates for
every jail operations employee in facilities housing
more than 50 inmates, and 2.0 in facilities housing 50
or fewer inmates.

In 1999, when the last national jail census was conducted, 
the U.S. average among all local jails was 4.0 inmates per 
correctional officer. Small jails holding 50 or fewer 
inmates held an average of 2.0 inmates per correctional 
officer. 


Jails hired 282 new payroll staff between 
July 2002 and June 2003

During the 12-month period ending June 30, 2003,
authorities in 58 facilities hired a total of 282 new
payroll staff, including persons rehired or recalled 
from layoff. The Gila River Facilities (adult and 
juvenile, combined) hired the most new staff (21). 
Eleven facilities reported no new hires during the 
period. At midyear 2003 Indian country jails reported 
189 staff vacancies. Gila River Department of 
Corrections and Rehabilitation and Tohono O'odham 
Detention Center reported the largest number of vacancies 
(16). A total of 22 of the 61 facilities reporting staff 
vacancy data had no vacancies at the end of June 2003. 

Methodology

"Indian country" is a statutory term that includes the
following: all lands within an Indian reservation,
dependent Indian communities, and Indian trust
allotments (18 U.S.C. sec 1151). Courts interpret sec
1151 to include all lands held in trust for tribes or 
their members. See United States v. Roberts. 185 F.3d
1125 (10th Cir. 1999). Tribal authority to sentence
offenders is limited to 1 year of imprisonment and a
$5,000 fine or both (25 U.S.C. sec 1302(7)).

Tribal law enforcement agencies act as first
responders to both felony and misdemeanor crimes.
For most of Indian country, the Federal Government
provides felony law enforcement concerning crimes by
or against Indians. Certain areas of Indian country are
under Public Law 83-280, as amended. P.L. 280
conferred jurisdiction on certain States over "Indian
country" and suspended enforcement of the Major
Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. sec 1153) and the General
Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. sec 1152) in those areas. Indian 
tribes retain concurrent jurisdiction to enforce laws 
in Indian country where P.L. 280 applies.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducted the
Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) to describe all
adult and juvenile jail facilities and detention centers 
in Indian country. For purposes of this report, Indian
country includes reservations, pueblos, rancherias,
and other appropriate areas (18 U.S.C. sec 1151). The 
reference date for the most recent survey is June 30, 
2003.

The SJIC was initiated in 1998 as a component of the
Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ). The ASJ is conducted in
each of the years between the Census of Jails. The
2003 ASJ consisted of a sample survey of 823 local
jail jurisdictions, a survey of the Nation's 55
multi-jurisdictional facilities, and a survey of the 
70 facilities in Indian country. (For sampling 
information, see Prison and Jails Inmates at Midyear 
2003, BJS Bulletin, May 2003,
<www.ojp.Usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/pjim03.htm>.)

In 1998 the Office of Law Enforcement Services,
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. Department of 
the Interior, provided a complete list of 74 Indian 
country jail facilities. The list included detention 
centers, jails, and other correctional facilities, 
operated by tribal authorities or the BIA. Since 1998, 
3 facilities were added, 3 were closed, 2 facilities 
were abandoned, 2 were combined into 1 facility, and 
1 was closed during the collection period, resulting 
in 70 surveyed facilities. The facilities are in 19 
States and are affiliated with 55 tribes.

Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Through 
follow-up phone calls and facsimiles, 62 of 70 
facilities responded. Data for the Tohono O'odham
Judiciary Juvenile Detention Center, Crow Police
Department, Fort Peck Indian Youth Services Center,
Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes Department of
Corrections, Mescalero Adult Detention Center,
Navajo Department of Corrections-Tohatchi Juvenile
Center, and the Ponca Tribal Police Department are
from June 28, 2002. Data for the Navajo Department
of Corrections in Shiprock are from June 29, 2001.
