Highlights
                   
From yearend 1990 to 
midyear 2000 --
*  The rate of incarceration in prison and jail
increased from 1 in every 218 U.S. residents to
1 in every 142.

*  State, Federal, and local governments had to
accommodate an additional 82,438 inmates per
year (or the equivalent of 1,585 new inmates
per week).

In the year ending June 30, 2000 --
*  The number of inmates held in jail  rose by
15,206, in State prison by 27,953, and in
Federal prison by 13,501.  In the three largest
State prison systems, the number dropped in
California (down 33 inmates) and New York (down
2,269 inmates), while it rose in Texas (up 890
inmates). 

On June 30, 2000 -- 
*  Privately operated prison facilities held
76,010 inmates (up 9.1% since yearend 1999).
 
*  Local jails were operating 8% below their
rated capacity. In contrast, at yearend 1999
State prisons were between 1% and 17% above
capacity, and Federal prisons were 32% above
their rated capacity. 

*  An estimated 12% of black males, 4% of
Hispanic males, and 1.7% of white males in
their twenties and early thirties were in
prison or jail.
  
*  There were 110 female inmates per 100,000
women in the U.S., compared to 1,297 male
inmates per 100,000 men. 
--------------------------------------------------------

At midyear 2000 the Nation's prisons and jails
incarcerated 1,931,859 persons.  Federal and
State prison authorities and local jail
authorities held in their custody 702 persons
per 100,000 U.S. residents.  Prisoners in the
custody of the 50 States, the District of
Columbia, and the Federal Government accounted
for two-thirds of the incarcerated population
(1,310,710 inmates).  The other third were held
in local jails (621,149).

On June 30, 2000, 1,385,492 prisoners were
under Federal and State jurisdiction, which
includes inmates in custody and persons under
the legal authority of a prison system but held
outside its facilities.  The number under State
jurisdiction rose by 1.5% -- the smallest
annual growth rate in 29 years -- while the
number under Federal jurisdiction rose by 9.3%. 
Idaho (up 17.9%), Delaware (up 12.5%), and
North Dakota (up 10.5%) had the largest
percentage increases.  Eleven States had
decreases, including Massachusetts (-4.8%),
Alaska (-4.4%), and New York (-3.1%). 

At midyear 2000 local jail authorities held or
supervised 687,033 offenders.  Ten percent of
these offenders (65,884) were supervised
outside jail facilities in programs such as
community service, work release, weekend
reporting, electronic monitoring, and other
alternative programs. 

1.9 million inmates were in prisons 
and local jails

On June 30, 2000, 1,310,710 inmates were in the
custody of State and Federal prison
authorities, and 621,149 inmates were in the
custody of local jail authorities.  These data
were collected in the 2000 National Prisoner
Statistics  program and the 2000 Annual Survey
of Jails.  Since midyear 1999 the total
incarcerated population has increased 3.0%. 
Including inmates in public and privately
operated facilities, the number of inmates in
State prisons increased 2.4%; in Federal
prisons, 11.4%; and in local jails, 2.5%.  At
midyear 2000, 6.8% of inmates were held in
Federal prison, up from 5.1% in 1990. 

Between 1990 and midyear 2000, the incarcerated
population grew on average 5.6% annually. 
During this period the Federal and State prison
populations and the local jail population grew
at the average annual rates of 8.8%, 5.9%, and
4.6%, respectively. 

--------------------------------
Based on current policies and practices, 
the Nation's inmate population is projected 
to reach 2 million by late 2001

*  Although future growth is difficult to
predict due to declining crime rates and
changing Federal, State, and local criminal
justice policies, inmate populations can be
projected based on recent numerical increases
and growth rates.  Based on three different
sets of assumptions about Federal and State
prison and local jail population growth,
national estimates have been produced through
the end of 2005.

*  Assuming a continuation of either numerical
increases or growth rates for the 12-month
period ending June 30, 2000, the total  inmate
population is projected to reach 2 million by
the end of 2001 and 2.2 million by 2005.

*  If growth rates continue to decline and then
stabilize by yearend 2005, the Nation's prison
and jail population will total 2.1 million. 
Assuming the inmate populations grow at the
same rate as the U.S. resident population, by
2005 the incarceration rate will stabilize at
735 inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents.

--------------------------------------

In the 12 months before midyear 2000, the
number of inmates in prison and jail rose an
estimated 56,660 inmates, or 1,090 inmates per
week.  Since yearend 1990, the total custody
population has risen by 783,157 inmates, the
equivalent of 1,585 inmates per week.

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail in
2000 was 702 inmates per 100,000 U.S. 
residents -- up from 458 per 100,000 in 1990.  
At midyear 2000, 1 in every 142 U.S. residents 
were incarcerated.

U.S. prison population rose 2.3%-- 
the smallest annual growth rate 
since 1971

Between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000, the
number of inmates under State jurisdiction grew
1.5%, and the number under Federal jurisdiction, 
9.3%.  Jurisdiction counts include prisoners in 
custody and persons under the legal authority of 
a prison system while being held outside its 
facilities.  Compared to the previous 12-month 
period ending June 30, 1999, State prison growth 
rates were significantly smaller (down from 3.8%), 
while the Federal prison growth rate was down from
9.6%.

In absolute numbers, the total increase of
30,710 prison inmates between July 1, 1999, 
and June 30, 2000, was the smallest 12-month
increase in the decade and about half the
annual average growth (59,244) since 1990.

--------------------------
Nearly 40% of the growth in the prison
populations during the 12 months ending June
30, 2000, was accounted for by the Federal
system (12,152 additional inmates).  During
this 12-month period, three States experienced
growth of at least 10%, led by Idaho (17.9%),
Delaware (12.5%), and North Dakota (10.5%). 
Eleven States experienced a decline in their
prison population.  Massachusetts had the
largest percentage decrease (-4.8%), followed
by Alaska (-4.4%), New York (-3.1%), and New
Jersey (-2.8%). 

Prison incarceration rates have risen sharply 
since 1990

The incarceration rate of State and Federal
prisoners sentenced to more than 1 year reached
481 per 100,000 U.S. residents on June 30,
2000.  Eleven States led by Louisiana (793
sentenced prisoners per 100,000 State
residents), Texas (779), Oklahoma (681), and
Mississippi (630) exceeded the national rate. 
Three States -- Minnesota (129), Maine (130),
and North Dakota (146) -- had rates that were
less than a third of the national rate.  The
District of Columbia, a totally urban
jurisdiction, held 1,264 sentenced prisoners
per 100,000 District residents at midyear 2000.

Since 1990 the number of sentenced inmates per
100,000 residents has risen an average of 5.4%
annually, increasing from 292 to 481.  During
this period prison incarceration rates rose the
most in the South (from 316 to 550) and West
(from 277 to 424).  The rate in the Midwest
rose from 239 to 371, and the rate in the
Northeast rose from 232 to 327.  The number of
sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S.
residents increased from 20 to 43 over the same
period.

Privately operated prisons held over 76,000 
State and Federal inmates 

On June 30, 2000, 31 States, the District of
Columbia, and the Federal system reported a
total of 76,010 prisoners held in privately
operated facilities.  These private facilities
held 5.8% of all State inmates, up from 5.4%
at yearend 1999.

Since yearend 1999, when BJS began collecting
separate counts of privately held inmates, the
number of inmates in private facilities has
risen by 6,317, representing 9.1% increase in
the 6-month period.

Texas (with 14,339 State inmates housed in
private facilities)  and Oklahoma (with 6,735)
reported the largest number at midyear 2000. 
Four States -- New Mexico (41%), Alaska (34%),
Montana (32%), and Oklahoma (29%) -- and the
District of Columbia (36%) had at least 25% of
their prisoners in private facilities.  Except
for Wisconsin (with 22% of its State inmates in
private facilities) and New Jersey (with 8%),
the use of private facilities was concentrated
among Southern and Western States.
------------------------

Female prisoner population has 
more than doubled since 1990

From July 1, 1999, to June 30, 2000, the number
of women under the jurisdiction of State and
Federal prison authorities grew from 89,507 to
92,688, an increase of 3.6%.  The number of men
rose 2.2%, from 1,265,275 to 1,292,804.  At
midyear 2000 California, Texas, and the Federal
systems housed nearly 4 of every 10 females
inmates.

Since 1990 the annual rate of growth of female
inmates has averaged 8.1%, higher than the 6.2%
average increase of male inmates.  While the
number of male prisoners has grown 77% since
1990, the number of female prisoners has
increased 110%.  By June 30, 2000, women
accounted for 6.7% of all prisoners, up from
5.7% in 1990.
   
Relative to their number in the U.S. resident
population, men were nearly 15 times more
likely than women to be in a State or Federal
prison.  On June 30, 2000, the rate for inmates
serving a sentence of more than 1 year was 66
sentenced female inmates per 100,000 women in
the United States, compared to 961 sentenced
male inmates per 100,000 men. 

Number of State inmates under age 
18 declining

A total of 3,915 State prisoners were under age
18 on June 30, 2000, down from 4,194 at midyear
1999.  Florida (with 466) and Connecticut (with
382) reported the largest number in prison at
midyear 2000, followed by New York (264), North
Carolina (263), and Texas (261).  Overall,
fewer than half of 1% of State inmates were
under age 18.  

At midyear the Nation's jails supervised
687,033 persons

As defined in this report, jails are locally
operated correctional facilities that confine
persons before or after adjudication.  Inmates
sentenced to jail usually have a sentence of 1
year or less, but jails also incarcerate
persons in a wide variety of other categories. 
(See box below.)

Based on the 2000 Annual Survey of Jails, the
Nation's local jails held or supervised 687,033
offenders on June 30, 2000.  Jail authorities
supervised 10% of these offenders (65,884) in
alternative programs outside the jail
facilities.  A total of 621,149 persons were
housed in local jails.

---------------------------------
Jails --

*  receive individuals pending arraignment and
hold them awaiting trial, conviction, or
sentencing

*  readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond
violators and absconders

*  temporarily detain juveniles pending
transfer to juvenile authorities

*  hold mentally ill persons pending their
movement to appropriate health facilities

*  hold individuals for the military, for
protective custody, for contempt, and for the
courts as witnesses

*  release convicted inmates to the community
upon completion of sentence

*  transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other
authorities

*  house inmates for Federal, State, or other
authorities because of crowding of their
facilities

*  relinquish custody of temporary detainees to
juvenile and medical authorities

*  sometimes operate community- based programs
as alternatives to incarceration

*  hold inmates sentenced to short terms
(generally under 1 year).
---------------------------

Among persons under community supervision by
jail staff in 2000, 21% were required to
perform community service (13,592) and 22% to
participate in a weekend reporting program
(14,523).  Sixteen percent of offenders in the
community were under electronic monitoring; 10%
were other under pretrial supervision; 9% were
in a drug, alcohol, mental health, or other
type of medical treatment program; and 12% were
in a work release or other alternative work
program.

Number of jail inmates rose 15,200 
in 12 months ending June 30, 2000
 
Between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000, the
number of persons held in local jail facilities
grew 2.5% -- from 605,943 to 621,149.  The
12-month increase was well below the average
growth (4.4%) from midyear 1990 to midyear
2000.  In absolute numbers, the total increase
of 15,206 inmates in 2000 represented an
increase in growth since 1999 (in which the
number of inmates rose by 13,481 or 2.3% from
1998).

When offenders under community supervision by
jail authorities are included with those in
custody, the rate was 250 offenders per 100,000
U.S. residents at midyear 2000.

A total of 7,616 persons under age 18 were
housed in adult jails on June 30, 2000.  Eighty
percent of these young inmates had been
convicted or were being held for trial as
adults in criminal court.  (See Methodology for
definition of juvenile.) 

The average daily population for the year
ending June 30, 2000, was 618,319, an increase
of 1.7% from 1999. 

Characteristics of jail inmates
changed little

Male inmates made up 88.6% of the local jail
inmate population at midyear 2000 -- 2
percentage points lower than at midyear 1990.  
During the 12-month period ending June 30,
2000, the number of female inmates rose by
4.3%, while the percent of male inmates rose by
2.7%.  On average the adult female jail
population has grown 6.6% annually since 1990,
while the adult male inmate population has
grown 4%.  On June 30, 2000, local jails held
nearly 1 in every 181 adult men and 1 in 1,509
adult women.

At midyear 2000 a majority of local jail
inmates were black or Hispanic.  White
non-Hispanics made up 41.9% of the jail
population; black non-Hispanics, 41.3%;
Hispanics, 15.1%; and other races (Asians,
Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and 
Alaska Natives), 1.6%.

Relative to their number of U.S. residents,
black non-Hispanics were over 5 1/2 times more
likely than white non-Hispanics, over 2 1/2 
times more likely than Hispanics, and over 9 
times more likely than persons of other races 
to have been held in a local jail on 
June 30, 2000.

On June 30, 2000, an estimated 56% of the
Nation's adult jail inmates were awaiting court
action on their current charge.   An estimated
270,000 inmates held in local jails were
serving a sentence in jail, awaiting sentencing, 
or serving time for a probation or parole 
violation.

The 50 largest jail jurisdictions 
housed a third of all jail inmates 

On June 30, 2000, the Nation's 50 largest jail
jurisdictions held 33% (206,914) of all jail
inmates. 

Twenty-one States had at least one jurisdiction
which ranked in the top 50 for average daily
population. States with more than one
jurisdiction among the Nation's 50 largest
jurisdictions are California (11), Florida (8),
Texas (6), Georgia (3), Ohio (3), Pennsylvania
(2), Tennessee (2), and New Jersey (2).

The two jurisdictions with the most inmates,
Los Angeles County and New York City, together
held approximately 33,300 inmates, or 5.4% of
the national total.  

Nineteen jurisdictions among the 50 largest
experienced a decrease in the number of inmates
held between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000. 
Jurisdictions with the largest decreases were
Fulton County, GA (down 15.1%); San Francisco
and Santa Clara County, CA (both down 14.6%);
New York City,  NY (down 12.1%); and Shelby
County, TN (down 10.9%).  Jurisdictions with
the largest increases in their jail populations
were San Bernardino County, CA (up 17.4%);
Travis County, TX (15.9%); Oklahoma County, OK
(13.5%); De Kalb County, GA  (12.3%); and
Broward County, FL (11.5) 

At midyear 2000, 92% of jail 
capacity was occupied

In the 12 months ending June 30, 2000, more
beds than inmates were added to the Nation's
jails.  At midyear 2000 the rated capacity of
the Nation's local jails was estimated at
677,787, an increase of 25,466 in 12 months. 

Rated capacity is the maximum number of beds or
inmates allocated by State or local rating
officials to each jail facility.  The growth in
jail capacity during the 12-month period ending
on June 30, 2000, was less than the average
growth of 28,862 beds every 12 months since
1990, and was considerably less than growth of
jail capacity in 1999 (39,541). As of June 30,
2000, 92% of the local jail capacity was
occupied.(*On December 31, State prisons were
operating at between 1% and 17% above capacity,  
while Federal prisons were operating at 32%
above capacity.  See Prisoner and Jail 
Inmates at Midyear 1999, April 2000, NCJ
181643*).  As a ratio of all inmates housed 
in jail facilities to total capacity, the
percentage occupied decreased by 12 percentage
points from 1990 to 2000.  At midyear 1990
local jails operated at 4% above their rated
capacity.  

Jail jurisdictions with the largest average
daily populations reported the highest
occupancy rates.  At midyear 2000 occupancy was
103% of rated capacity in jail jurisdictions
with an average daily population of 1,000 or
more inmates, compared to 68% in those with
fewer than 50 inmates.

An estimated 12% of black males 
in their twenties and early thirties 
were in prison or jail in 2000

When total incarceration rates are estimated
separately by age group, black males in their
twenties and thirties are found to have very
high rates relative to other groups.  Among the
more than 1.9 million offenders incarcerated on
June 30, 2000, an estimated 588,800 were black
males between the ages of 20 and 39.

Expressed in terms of percentages, 13.1% of
black non-Hispanic males age 25 to 29 were in
prison or jail, compared to 4.1% of Hispanic
males and about 1.7% of white males in the same
age group.  Although incarceration rates drop
with age, the percentage of black males age 45
to 54 in prison or jail in 2000 was an estimated 
3.4% -- nearly twice the highest rate (1.9%) among 
white males (age 30 to 34).

Female incarceration rates, though
significantly lower than male rates at every
age, reveal similar racial and ethnic
disparities.  Black non-Hispanic females (with
a prison and jail rate of 380 per 100,000) were
3 times more likely than Hispanic females (117
per 100,000) and 6 times more likely than white
females (63 per 100,000) to be incarcerated in
2000.  These differences among white, black,
and Hispanic females were consistent across all
age groups.

Among black non-Hispanic females, the rate was
highest (1,409 per 100,000) among those age 30
to 34.  This rate was only slightly lower than
the highest rate among white males (1,861 per
100,000).

Methodology
   
National Prisoner Statistics (NPS)

The Bureau of Justice Statistics, with the U.S.
Census Bureau as its collection agent, obtains
yearend and midyear counts of prisoners from
departments of correction in each of the 50
States, the District of Columbia, and the
Federal Bureau of Prisons.  

In an effort to collect comparable data from
all jurisdictions, NPS distinguishes between
prisoners in custody from those under
jurisdiction.  To have custody of a prisoner, a
State must hold that person in one of its
facilities.  To have jurisdiction, a State has
legal authority over the prisoner.  Prisoners
under a State's jurisdiction may be in the
custody of a local jail, another State's
prison, or other correctional facility.  Some
States are unable to provide both custody and
jurisdiction counts.  (See National Prisoner
Statistics jurisdiction notes.)

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined
in locally administered confinement facilities
who are under the jurisdiction of local
authorities.  NPS counts include all inmates in
State-operated facilities in Alaska,
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island,
and Vermont, which have combined jail-prison
systems.

Annual Survey of Jails, 2000

In each of the years between the full censuses,
a sample survey of jails is conducted to
estimate baseline characteristics of the
Nation's jails and the inmates housed in these
jails.

Based on information from the 1999 Census of
Jails, a sample of jail jurisdictions was
selected for the 2000 survey.  A jurisdiction
is a county (parish in Louisiana) or municipal
government that administers one or more local
jails.  The sample included all jail facilities
(947) in 877 jurisdictions.

In drawing the sample, all multi-jurisdictional
(45) jails were included in the sample with
certainty.  These jails are operated jointly by
two or more jurisdictions.  Other jurisdictions
(357) were included automatically in the sample
if their jails held juvenile inmates on census
day and had an average daily population of 250
or more inmates, or if their jails held only
adults and had an average daily population of
500 or more. 

The remaining jurisdictions were stratified
into two groups: jurisdictions with jails
holding at least one juvenile on June 30, 1999,
and jurisdictions with jails holding adults
only.  Using stratified probability sampling,
475 jurisdictions were then selected from 10
strata based on the average daily population in
the 1999 census. 

Data were obtained by mailed and web-based
survey questionnaires.  After follow-up phone
calls to respondents, the response rate for the
survey was 100% for critical items such as
rated capacity, average daily population, and
number of inmates confined.

Sampling error

Survey estimates have an associated sampling
error because not all jurisdictions were
contacted for the survey.  Estimates based on
the sample survey may differ somewhat from the
results of conducting a complete census.

Different samples could yield somewhat
different results.  Standard error is a measure
of the variation among the estimates from all
possible samples, stating the precision with
which an estimate from a particular sample
approximates the average of all possible
samples.  The estimated relative sampling error
for the total number of persons under the
jurisdiction of jail authorities of 687,033 on
June 30, 2000, was 0.41%; for persons held in
the custody of jail authorities of 621,149 was
0.41%.  (See appendix tables 1 and 2 on page 11
for specific estimates and their relative
sampling errors.)

Juveniles

State statutes and judicial practices allow
juveniles to be incarcerated in adult jails
under a variety of circumstances.  Because of
the differing statutes and practices, however,
accurate and comparable data on juveniles are
difficult to collect.

Beginning in 1994 BJS has provided estimates of
the total number of jail inmates under age 18,
the number held as adults, and the number held
as juveniles.  Sampling procedures were first
implemented in 1994 and then further modified
in 2000 to minimize the standard errors of
these estimates.
