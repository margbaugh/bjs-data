Abstract:
************

Federal Sentencing Disparity, 2005-2012, examines patterns of 
federal sentencing disparity among white and black offenders, 
by sentence received, and looks at judicial variation in 
sentencing since Booker vs. United States, regardless of race. 
It summarizes U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, discusses how 
approaches of other researchers to the study of sentencing 
practices differ from this approach, defines disparity as used 
in this study, and explains the methodology. This working paper 
was prepared by Abt Associates for BJS in response to a request by 
the Department of Justice’s Racial Disparities Working Group to 
design a study of federal sentencing disparity. Data are from 
BJS’s Federal Justice Statistics Program, which annually 
collects federal criminal justice processing data from various 
federal agencies. The analysis uses data mainly from the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission.

Introduction
**************

As part of a cooperative agreement for the Federal Justice 
Statistics Program (FJSP), the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
(BJS) instructed Abt Associates to design a study of federal 
sentencing disparity, as requested by the U.S. Department of 
Justice’s Racial Disparities Working Group. This report 
responds to those instructions by presenting a new methodology 
for studying sentencing disparity. Although this report is 
principally a discussion of methods, findings are also 
discussed. For the purposes of this study, the broad research 
question is--

* Do non-Hispanic African American or black (hereafter black) 
offenders receive prison terms that are longer on average than 
the prison terms received by non-Hispanic white (hereafter 
white) offenders, accounting for the apparent facts surrounding 
the crime and the offender’s criminal record? We call observed 
differences disparity, although based on the evidence we cannot 
attribute disparate decision-making to racial bias.

The principal research question concerns the sentencing 
disparity between white and black offenders. However, using the 
above measure of disparity, the broad research question is 
divided into the following specific questions:

1. Did the degree of disparity change between 2005 and 2012? 
As explained later in this report, the years are important 
because a 2005 Supreme Court decision (Booker v. United 
States) (hereafter Booker) rendered the Federal Sentencing 
Guidelines advisory.

2. Did the degree of disparity change with the seriousness 
of the offense and the offender’s criminal history?

3. To what extent was the disparity systematic and to what 
extent was it specific to individual judges?

4. Between 2005 and 2012, a period in which the guidelines 
were advisory rather than mandatory, did judges increasingly 
disagree about the appropriate sentences for offenders?

The first two questions pertain directly to patterns regarding 
the differences in sentences received by white and black 
offenders. The third and fourth questions pertain to judicial 
disagreement about sentences without regard to race. Several 
recent studies have examined how the Booker decision affected 
disparity by giving judges increased latitude to impose 
sentences. Our study, which uses post-Booker data exclusively, 
does not purport to examine the impact of Booker. ***Footnote 1
Program evaluators recognize that assessing the impact of 
Booker is an application of program evaluation, which is 
complicated and uncertain outside of randomized experimentation 
because causation is difficult to establish. At the least, a 
study of Booker’s impact would require the use of pre- and 
post-Booker sentencing data, but the study reported here uses 
post-Booker data only. Even if it included pre-Booker data, 
attributing chances to Booker would raise validity challenges. 
The methodology discussed in the study reported here does not 
deal with methods that might be used to overcome those validity 
challenges***.

Data for this study come from the FJSP, sponsored by BJS, which 
annually assembles federal criminal justice processing data 
from various federal agencies. The analyses rests heavily on 
data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) because those 
data are the richest source of offense and offender 
information, as the USSC is the principal source of data for 
sentencing. However, this study draws on other parts of the 
FJSP for judicial identity. The data used in this study and the 
study itself do not identify specific judges by name.

*****************************************
1.0 Federal Sentencing Guidelines
*****************************************

Federal Sentencing Guidelines are a set of rules and policy 
statements for federal judges to use when imposing sentences. 
(See appendix A for more information.) At the time of 
sentencing, a judge considers the facts surrounding the case 
along with the offender’s criminal history and his or her 
cooperation with the government and then assigns the offender 
to a cell in a two-dimensional 43x6 sentencing grid. The grid’s 
vertical axis corresponds to the facts surrounding the case 
(e.g., brandishing a weapon during a bank robbery). The grid’s 
horizontal axis corresponds to the offender’s criminal history 
(e.g., the offender previously served a prison term in excess 
of 1 year). If the offender cooperated with the government, the 
sentencing judge can move the offender from one cell to 
another, according to prescribed rules.

The guideline cell stipulates a recommended sentence based on 
the facts surrounding the case (e.g., the charge, use of a 
weapon, and amount of drugs involved), the offender’s criminal 
record, and the offender’s cooperation with the government. 
Some of the cells allow for probation sentences and some allow 
for a combination of probation and prison. All of the cells 
identify a lower and upper limit for any recommended prison 
term, each with no more than a 25% difference between the lower 
and upper limit (excluding cells recommending the shortest 
sentences).

When promulgated in 1987, the guidelines were mandatory and 
judges were expected to sentence within the lower and upper 
limits, although they could depart from the guidelines with 
written justification subject to appellate review. Since 2005, 
the guidelines have been advisory and the scope of appellate 
review is limited. Although our study examines the current 
application of the guidelines, a historical perspective is 
helpful for defining current:

* Mandatory guidelines went into effect for most criminal 
cases in 1987. The guidelines have been revised at the USSC’s 
discretion, subject to Senate approval.

* In 1996, Koon v. United States (hereafter Koon) clarified the 
role of appellate court review. Deference was paid to fact 
findings at the district court level; i.e., an appellate court 
had to accept the facts determined by the sentencing judge. 
This meant that review was limited to mechanical errors in 
applying the guidelines and the legitimacy of reasons for 
departure.

* In 2003, Congress passed the PROTECT Act (hereafter PROTECT), 
which required justification for departures, thereby reducing 
judicial latitude to depart from the guidelines. In exchange 
for cooperation with the government, the Commission 
strengthened the guidelines consistent with PROTECT and 
formalized some provisions for reducing sentences. Congress 
specified that higher court review would be de novo, meaning 
that circuit courts no longer had to defer to lower court 
findings of fact. As a result, Koon was nullified.

* In 2005 Booker v. United States (hereafter Booker), the 
Supreme Court ruled that the guidelines were advisory rather 
than mandatory and reestablished the level of deference to 
findings of fact consistent with Koon. The PROTECT Act retained 
the features that reward cooperation with the government.

* In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Gall v. United States 
(hereafter Gall) that the federal appeals courts may not 
presume that a sentence falling outside the range recommended 
by the guidelines is unreasonable. This decision strengthened 
the authority of district court judges to depart from the 
guidelines.

The USSC identifies four periods in the evolution of the 
guidelines (Commission, 2012). Ignoring pre-Koon, the periods 
are Koon to PROTECT, PROTECT to Booker, Booker to Gall, and 
post-Gall. The Commission’s report shows how disparity has 
changed over these four periods. However, BJS is concerned with 
disparity under current sentencing laws. Our analysis is 
focused on post-Booker sentencing, meaning that we examine 
sentences imposed during the last two periods.

In Gall, the Supreme Court specified the procedure for post-
Booker sentencing. Although the guidelines are advisory, a 
sentencing judge must compute and consider the guideline range 
and the Commission’s policy statements. Thus, although the 
guidelines are currently advisory, they are not irrelevant. An 
empirical study can still treat the elements entering into 
guideline computations (as reported by the Commission) as 
representing the facts surrounding the case and the offender’s 
criminal history as established by a preponderance of the 
evidence (i.e., the evidentiary standard for application of the 
guidelines).***Footnote 2 2 Chapter 6 § 6A1.3 specifies the 
evidentiary rules: “In resolving any dispute regarding a factor 
important to the sentencing determination, the court may 
consider relevant information without regard to its 
admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, 
provided the information has sufficient indicia of reliability 
to support its probable accuracy”***. For our purposes, this 
means that we can consider the guideline cell as the starting 
point for studying disparity under the guidelines. This is 
extremely important because otherwise we would be unable to 
distinguish between variation in sentences that are attributed 
to facts surrounding the case or criminal record and systematic 
unwarranted variation.

The judge must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 
3553(a) taken as a whole. *** Footnote 3 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) 
states the purposes of sentencing, states the role of the 
guidelines when imposing a sentence, and provides justification 
for sentencing below mandatory minimums and for rewarding 
offender assistance to the government***. There are 
disagreements in circuits and among legal scholars regarding 
when courts may disregard commission policy--and even 
congressional policy--and the permissible grounds for doing so 
have not been resolved. Further, the courts are divided on two 
important questions: “How much weight should be given to 
guidelines resulting from congressional directives to the 
Commission?” and “What is the appropriate interaction between 
the proscriptions and limitations on consideration of offender 
characteristics in section 994 of Title 28 and the courts’ 
consideration of offender characteristics in section 3553(a)?” 
***Footnote 4 28 U.S. Code § 994 prescribes duties of the 
USSC.***.Booker has given judges substantial discretion, 
reinforced by Gall, to impose sentences using subjective 
decisions about the adequacy of the sentences recommended by 
the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. This observation is 
important because it provides motivation for studying how that 
discretion is being exercised and whether sentencing disparity 
is associated with that judicial discretion.

A principal difficulty when studying disparity is that the 
facts surrounding the case cannot be known with certainty. 
Assistant U.S. Attorneys and defense council may manipulate 
facts to bind the judge or to avoid mandatory minimum sentences 
(Commission, 2011). Even when the facts surrounding the case 
accurately reflect offense behavior and consequences, the judge 
may observe additional facts (relevant for sentencing) that do 
not appear in the guidelines and, as a result, do not appear in 
our data. Fact manipulation and data limitations raise 
difficult problems with interpretation, which are addressed 
later in this report. (See section 5.3.)

*******************************************
2.0 Recent Studies of Sentencing Disparity
*******************************************

Many researchers have examined disparity under the Federal 
Sentencing Guidelines, but fewer researchers have focused their 
attention on the post-Booker era. We limit this review to 
selected studies that examine post-Booker federal sentencing.

All analyses of sentencing disparity are predicated on a 
normative position that similarly situated offenders who have 
been convicted of similar crimes should receive similar 
sentences. The exact meaning of this normative position is 
debatable, but it seems as though most people would agree that 
black and white offenders, convicted of the same crime under 
the same conditions, should receive equivalent sentences. 
Researchers examining the post-Booker era have taken two 
approaches to testing the null hypothesis of sentencing 
equality.

One approach has been to start with the facts surrounding the 
case as relevant to application of the Federal Sentencing 
Guidelines and to determine whether whites and blacks receive 
comparable sentences. Several studies (Motivans & Snyder, 2009; 
Ulmer, Light, & Kramer, 2011; Commission, 2012) follow this 
approach. An alternative approach is to start with the facts 
surrounding the case at the time of prosecution, with the 
assertion that prosecutors manipulate facts before they are 
considered for guideline application and determine whether 
offenders accused of the same crime receive the same treatment. 
Other works (Starr & Rehavi, 2013; Rehavi & Starr, 2013; 
Fishman & Schanzenback, 2012; Yang, 2014) are consistent with 
this alternative approach. These two lines of inquiry answer 
different research questions, although both are framed as 
studies of sentencing disparity. This section summarizes these 
studies and compares the current study’s approach with extant 
studies.

Consistent with its role in the federal justice system, the 
USSC frequently studies federal sentencing patterns. Its Report 
on the Continuing Impact of United States v. Booker on Federal 
Sentencing (2012) is a comprehensive assessment of how the 
Booker decision affected the application of federal sentences. 
Much of that assessment is tabulation and graphical 
representation; the descriptive nature of the analysis 
appropriately tells a story suitable for the Commission’s 
audience. Part of the Commission’s assessment also includes an 
empirical analysis that is multivariate and inferential, and is 
similar to the methods presented in our study.

To assess racial disparity at the time of sentencing, the 
Commission used an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression 
model, with the length of the prison term as the dependent 
variable, the minimum recommended sentence range as the 
principal covariates, and race and sex as multiplicative 
factors. ***Footnote 5 The Commission used OLS to regress the 
logarithm of time served on the logarithm of the minimum 
sentence and a linear combination of variables, including race. 
This is equivalent to assuming that the race variable has a 
multiplicative effect on the sentence imposed. The 
specification is cumbersome because sentences and guideline 
minimums are frequently zero and the logarithm of zero 
is undefined. The Commission set the logarithm of zero to a 
small positive number***. The Commission concluded that 
“…unwarranted disparities in federal sentencing appear to be 
increasing” (Commission, 2012, p. 3). Summarizing its findings:

“The Commission’s updated multivariate regression analysis 
showed, among other outcomes, that black male offenders have 
continued to receive longer sentences than similarly situated 
white male offenders.... In addition, female offenders have 
received shorter sentences than similarly situated male 
offenders.” (Commission, 2012, p. 9)

As with the analysis reported in our study, the Commission used 
the recommended sentence in the Federal Sentencing Guidelines 
as the starting point for an analysis, asking how sentences for 
blacks differed systematically from sentences for whites. 
Regarding salient differences between our study and the 
Commission’s study, the Commission used a pre- and post-Booker 
selection of data, given its concern with the impact of Booker, 
while our analysis is concerned only with post-Booker trends. 
The Commission used what we view as strong assumptions about 
the underlying sentencing decisions of the structural model, 
while we have used a structural model that is more flexible. 
The Commission used an OLS regression model; our approach uses 
a linear random effects regression model. Our principal 
analysis excludes noncitizens while the Commission included 
noncitizens, and our analysis makes a somewhat different 
selection of offenses than was made by the Commission. (This 
report provides a separate analysis of the sentencing of 
noncitizens.)

Motivans and Snyder (2009) analyzed USSC data for fiscal years 
1994 through 2008. Their results show that blacks receive mean 
prison terms that are, in general, longer than whites, and are 
longer than whites after adjusting for offense seriousness and 
criminal history, both together and separately. Much of that 
disparity disappeared once a regression was used to control for 
departure type, ***Footnote 6 There are many reasons for 
departures. The most important reasons when studying sentencing 
disparity are departures attributable to the initiative of the 
assistant U.S. Attorney and departures attributable to judicial 
sentencing discretion***. offense type, and whether there was a 
weapons charge.

Motivans and Snyder (2009) examined sentences for whites and 
blacks within each guideline cell and then averaged over 
guideline cells. Their approach to estimating differences 
within guideline cells and then summarizing over the cells is 
in the spirit of the approach taken in our study. However, we 
adopted a regression model that provides a systematic summary 
of variation in disparity across the cells and over time that 
often uses stratification instead of covariates and leads to 
standard statistical testing.

Ulmer, Light, and Kramer (2011) wrote another study as a 
critique of a 2010 commission report (the predecessor of the 
report cited above). They examined a period that started well 
before 2005 through fiscal year 2009. Their findings proved 
sensitive to the short post-Booker period (Commission, 2012, 
pp. 11, part E); based on a reanalysis reported by the 
Commission (Commission, 2012, pp. 11, part E), revised Ulmer, 
Light, and Kramer findings for the post-Booker period are 
similar to those reported in the Commission’s study. An 
anonymous reviewer of an earlier draft of this BJS study 
reports replicating the Ulmer, Light, and Kramer approach using 
data extended through 2012. The reviewer found that disparity 
increases initially and then stops increasing. This BJS study 
will report similar findings. Ulmer, Light, and Kramer made 
decisions about excluding some cases that are consistent with 
our decisions, and they made decisions about including or not 
including covariates that are inconsistent with our decisions. 
They used an estimation procedure (a two-step estimator) with 
which we disagree, ***Footnote 7 The approach to two-step 
models is complicated (Rhodes, 2014). We do not object to 
estimating the first-stage equation of whether the judge 
imposes a prison term, which is a principal part of the Ulmer, 
Light, and Kramer study. However, consistency of the parameters 
in the second-stage equation depends on strong assumptions 
regarding independence of the first-stage and second-stage 
decision or else instrumental variables. When independence does 
not hold, estimated parameters will be biased estimates of 
their population counterparts. Ulmer, Light, and Kramer 
carefully attempted to counter these problems, but there is no 
good solution. An alternative approach is to use a generalized 
linear model to estimate the conditional mean instead of 
underlying parameters***. but we still find their results 
informative and credible.

Starr and Rehavi (2013) are critical of the above tradition 
that treats the guideline recommendations as the starting point 
for analysis; while they provide a methodological critique, 
their harshest criticism is that the above researchers are 
asking the wrong research question. ***Footnote 8 We are 
concerned with the Starr and Rehavi methodology, much of which 
is described in a second paper (Rehavi & Starr, 2012). We are 
not convinced that the initial charge is a good starting point 
for a disparity study. Our investigation shows that the charges 
registered by the U.S. Marshals Service are very broad and not 
good descriptions of underlying offense conduct. Also see 
Rehavi and Starr (2013)***. Ulmer, Light, and Kramer were 
concerned with disparity, conditional on the facts surrounding 
the case as determined at the time of guideline administration. 
Starr and Rehavi opine that the correct concern is with 
disparity, conditional on the original offense. They dismiss 
answers to the first question because apparent disparity at the 
sentencing stage may merely reflect charging and bargaining 
decisions by prosecutors.

Another recent study (Johnson, 2014) expands on this line of 
inquiry by examining racial disparities and prosecutorial 
decision-making in the context of a federal prosecutor’s 
decision to decline prosecution and his or her decision to 
prosecute an offender under a lesser charge than the arresting 
charge. Johnson’s work uses both fixed and random effects 
(logit) estimation to study a cohort of federal arrestees from 
2003 to 2005, and finds at least some evidence to support the 
argument that racial disparities exist in prosecutorial 
decision--making--although disparities tend to favor blacks, 
not whites. It is difficult to conclude from this study whether 
Johnson’s findings ultimately support or refute the argument by 
Starr and Rehavi that disparate sentences are a reaction by 
judges to bargaining decisions by prosecutors. On the one hand, 
Johnson demonstrates that charge reductions result in 
materially lower sentence lengths, but this decrease is not as 
large as it should have been given the decrease in the 
presumptive sentence that results from moving to a new 
guideline cell (Johnson, 2014, p. 74, table 9). On the other 
hand, Johnson shows that, even after controlling for the 
presence of charge reduction and the associated presumptive 
sentence, blacks still receive significantly longer sentences 
(Johnson, 2014, p. 74, table 9). It is difficult to conclude 
how behavior ultimately affects sentencing disparities on 
average. However, Johnson’s work emphasizes the importance of 
considering prosecutorial practices in studying sentencing 
disparities.

Fishman and Schanzenbach’s (2012) study is in the spirit of 
Starr and Rehavi’s (2013) study. ***Footnote 9 Fishman and 
Schanzenbach introduce the terms endogenous and exogenous, 
although not necessarily in a way that we find helpful. Their 
argument might be summarized to say that prosecutors make 
charging and bargaining decisions that are endogenous because 
they take judicial responses into account. Nevertheless, we 
consider the charging and bargaining outcomes as being 
exogenous to the judge’s decision***. It is straightforward, 
examining whether transitions from more to less restrictive 
guidelines (as a result of Supreme Court decisions) caused 
disparity to increase or decrease. They find that court 
decisions sometimes greatly alter the administration of justice 
(especially departures and sentencing at the statutory 
minimum), but our interpretation of their work is that the 
alteration in the administration of justice did not have a 
large impact on racial disparity. Yang (2013) takes a similar 
approach of basing inferences on short-term changes. After 
accounting for the exercise of prosecutorial discretion with 
regard to charging decision, Yang (2013, p. 2) finds evidence 
of a 4% increase in racial sentencing disparity post-Booker. 
Our study reports an increase of the same magnitude. 
***Footnote 10 Although Yang’s findings are similar to ours, 
there are large differences in methodology. Yang uses a 
regression model that imposes structural restrictions that are 
much more restrictive than those adopted for our study; 
includes noncitizens in the analysis while, for reasons 
explained later, we limit our analysis to citizens; and 
attempts to control for the exercise of prosecutorial 
discretion, while we examine the exercise of discretion but do 
not build it into our statistical model***.

Our view is that both lines of inquiry pose valid research 
questions. We agree with Starr and Rehavi that it may be 
impossible to fully discount an explanation that other 
unobserved variables--perhaps variables that can be attributed 
to prosecutorial discretion--account for estimated differences 
in the sentences for white and black offenders. However, if we 
observe trends toward increasing or decreasing disparity during 
a period where those unobserved factors are presumably or 
demonstrably constant, then those trends provide strong 
evidence of disparity attributable to race. ***Footnote 11 
Although they are critical of the traditional sentencing 
guidelines, Starr and Reventi (2013, p. 40) recognize the 
advantage of studies based on changes***. We can further 
strengthen the inferences by checking trends in other observed 
variables. Finding that there are no strong trends in observed 
variables, it seems reasonable to conclude that there are no 
strong trends in unobserved variables. Trend analysis plays 
an important role in the inferences drawn in our study.

Figure 1 summarizes the arguments. Presumably there is a true 
set of facts regarding the offender and the offense, although 
offenders attempt to hide their criminal behaviors; as a 
result, the facts may be known imperfectly. The facts are 
filtered by an assistant U.S. Attorney, who decides what to 
charge and attempts to prove what he or she charges, bargains 
with defendants and defense attorneys, and ultimately presents 
his or her set of facts to the judge. A probation officer 
investigates the offense conduct according to police reports 
(e.g., Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement 
Administration), learns about the offender’s criminal history, 
and studies the offender’s background (e.g., employment, and 
residential and marital status), and prepares and submits a 
presentence investigation report to the judge. Given the 
convicting charges and the facts surrounding the case, the 
judge imposes a sentence.

***********************************************
Figure 1 – A causal model of how offense 
and offender facts affect the sentence
***********************************************

The first set of studies examines the causal path that runs 
from “conviction charges” and “apparent facts” through the 
judge to the sentence. Conditional on the charge and facts that 
result from prosecutorial discretion, the judge imposes the 
sentence, and one can say that sentencing is disparate, 
conditional on those prosecutor-mediated facts. The second set 
of studies examines the causal path that runs from the facts 
through the sentence. Discretion exercised by prosecutors and 
judges is cumulative, so the disparity is jointly attributable 
to the prosecutor and judge. Our study shows that the first 
branch of the causal path (which involves the prosecutor) has 
changed little during the period of our study; that is, 
prosecutorial charging and bargaining practices have remained 
constant over the study period, or when practices have changed, 
the change has been the same for white and black offenders. In 
contrast, the second path (which involves the judge) has 
changed considerably; that is, judges have changed their 
behaviors conditional on the facts presented to them. While 
prosecutorial behaviors have remained fairly constant, racial 
disparity has increased. Although these trends toward greater 
disparity postdate Booker, we cannot say that Booker caused 
them and we cannot say what would happen if Booker were 
reversed.

Another line of enquiry has investigated inter-judge sentencing 
disparity post-Booker. This work has been limited because the 
USSC has not provided guidelines data matched with judge 
identifiers. As a result, studying inter-judge disparity on a 
wide scale using data that account for extensive variation in 
offense seriousness and offender criminal records has been 
restricted. Except for studies done at the Commission 
(Commission, 2012) and a study by Yang (2013) discussed below, 
researchers have had to work with data that have limited 
geographic (Scott, 2010) or offense (Mason & Bjerk, 2013) 
coverage, or with datasets that have limited detail about 
offenses and offenders (Hofer, 2012; Yang, 2014), or the 
studies have examined variation across districts rather than 
judges (Lynch & Omori, 2014). In contrast, the data used in 
this study have judge identifiers for all felonies and serious 
misdemeanors sentenced in federal courts between 2005 and 2012. 
Having similarly matched judges to guideline cases, Yang (2014) 
reports that judges who are appointed to the bench post-Booker 
are more likely to depart from the guidelines, but we could not 
replicate those findings.12 Using the same data and applying a 
simple analysis of variance technique, Yang (2013) shows that 
inter-judge disparity has increased from pre-Booker to post-
Gall. ***Footonote 13 Yang assumed that cases are randomly 
assigned to judges within districts, an assumption that seems 
reasonable given the rules used by most districts to assign 
cases and an assumption that passes diagnostic testing for 
that analysis. Our analysis is based on a similar assumption, 
but we control for offense and offender characteristics. 
As a result, our findings are less sensitive to whether 
or not assignment is random***.

As explained in the methodology section (section 4.0), we 
examine systematic differences across judges in the imposition 
of sentences for white and black offenders. Others have 
reported intra-judge disparity; applying more formality to the 
problem, similar to an approach used by others (Anderson & 
Spohn, 2010), our statistical model uses a random effect 
regression to estimate intra-judge disparity. Intra-judge 
disparity--as estimated using random effects--is less easily 
excused as disparate prosecutorial decision making or by 
unobserved factors relevant to sentencing because judges
essentially receive a random selection of cases for sentencing. 
We consider the estimation of random effects as a 
methodological advance.


Finally, our study differs from other studies by examining a 
longer period of post-Booker sentencing. Extant studies 
discussed previously have examined a shorter period. Our study 
may reveal trends that were obscured by a shorter period.

************************
3.0 Defining disparity
************************

There is no universally accepted definition of sentencing 
disparity. We propose a working definition to support empirical 
analysis. The working definition is necessarily abstract and 
readers who are less concerned with methodology may wish to 
skip sections 3.0 and 4.0 after reviewing the following 
summary. This section presents an argument for estimating the 
following:

* How blacks are disadvantaged compared to whites at the time 
of sentencing.

* How that disadvantage varies with offense seriousness and 
criminal record.

* How that disadvantage has varied over time.

* How the dispersion of sentences in general has varied over 
time.

We specify an operational model where the effect of race can be 
divided into four components: a basic race effect (first 
bullet), a race effect interacted with the guideline cell 
(second bullet), a race effect interacted with time (third 
bullet), and a skedastic function (dispersion about the 
regression line) as a function of time (fourth bullet).

**********************************
3.1 Disparity and the rule of law
**********************************

In the abstract, under the rule of law, offenders should know 
what will happen to them if they are convicted of a crime, and 
offenders convicted of similar crimes under similar 
circumstances should expect to receive similar sentences. In 
the abstract, then, there should be a function where a sentence 
S follows from the facts surrounding case A, the offender’s 
criminal history B, the government in exchange for 
cooperation C:

[1] S = f(A,B,C)

Throughout this report, we measure the sentence as the length 
of time sentenced to prison.***Footnote 14 For less serious 
crimes, we could examine the decision to impose a prison term. 
Most federal crimes for which the guidelines are relevant 
result in prison terms. As a result, the decision whether to 
sentence to prison is of secondary importance. The analysis of 
this binary outcome poses a few new analytic problems that are 
not considered when studying the prison sentence. Therefore, 
this design report does not consider the analysis of binary 
outcomes***. The function represents a normative standard, and 
any departure from this standard is called disparity.

In the abstract, a study of disparity is straightforward: Given 
equation [1], a researcher simply needs to measure the extent 
to which sentences depart from this standard.

An immediate problem is determining the standard to which a 
researcher can identify and measure disparity. There are three 
issues. First, what are the specific components of A, B, and C? 
Second, how should those components be weighted by importance? 
Third, how should the weighted components be combined to 
determine a sentence?

Congress has set broad parameters on the imposition of 
sentences in the form of statutory minimums and maximums. 
Presumably, sentences that fall outside these parameters are 
disparate, but that standard is not especially helpful because 
the parameters are wide and few sentences are imposed illegally 
outside these bounds. Within these broad parameters, Congress 
has delegated to the USSC, subject to Congressional veto, the 
power to determine the standard. The guidelines identify the 
elements of A, B, and C; specify how those elements should be 
weighted; and instruct how those weighted elements should be 
combined to impose a sentence. Essentially, the guidelines 
provide equation [1], subject to major caveats.

One caveat is that the guidelines were never an exact formula 
for imposing a sentence. The guidelines always gave judges 
latitude to sentence within a 25% range and always allowed 
judges to depart from the range when warranted. The 
justification is that while the guidelines should apply to most 
cases, the sentencing judge may uncover exceptional cases that 
require less severe or more severe punishment.

Although the guidelines always allowed judicial latitude, the 
Commission stipulated factors that could not be considered--
such as race or sex--when departing from the guidelines. Prior 
to Booker, disparity might be defined as sentences that were 
explained by forbidden factors (e.g., race) or that departed 
from the guidelines without acceptable justification. Prior to 
Booker, sentencing disparity was conceptually simple to define.

Post-Booker, existence of a standard is arguable and disparity 
is more difficult to define. The guidelines are advisory but, 
under Booker, they are still important as a standard that a 
judge must consult prior to imposing a sentence. The problem is 
that a sentence departing from the advisory guidelines cannot 
be identified as disparate because Booker and subsequent court 
decisions have ceded judges authority to impose sentences they 
see as appropriate given the purposes of sentencing. This means 
that after giving due consideration to the guidelines, an 
individual judge can make his or her own determination of 
equation [1]--the elements that are relevant for sentencing, how 
they should be weighted, and how they should be combined. One 
might even conclude that post-Booker, there is no meaningful 
standard.

******************************************
3.2 How to define disparity post-Booker
******************************************

How, then, should a researcher define and estimate sentencing 
disparity? The answer requires expanding the vocabulary used to 
describe sentencing disparity. A researcher can always observe 
how the sentence imposed differs from the sentence recommended 
by the guidelines. A difference cannot be declared to be 
disparate given that judges have discretion to depart from the 
guidelines. Nevertheless, some patterns in those differences 
are suggestive of disparity. To explain, this section 
identifies a model of how sentences are imposed and explains 
what that model tells or suggests about disparity. We start 
with a relatively simple model and progressively incorporate 
complexity.

We start with a model of how sentences are imposed within a 
given guideline cell. Rewrite equation [1] as equation [2]. The 
subscripts identify the ith offender sentenced by the jth judge 
in the kth guideline cell. Theijke represents the difference 
between the average sentences imposed within guideline cell k 
and the sentence actually imposed:

[2]     ijkkijkeSS+=
kSis the average sentence imposed for offenders sentenced 
within the kth guideline cell. A researcher would be concerned 
with observed patterns of e.

We consider a guideline cell to be an anchor; specifically, we 
consider the mean sentence within the guideline cell as a 
standard. It is possible that judges, as a collective, have 
common rules for departing from the guidelines. One way to 
account for a common rule is to introduce additional 
explanatory variables:

[3] ijkkijkkijkeXSS++=?

X is a row vector of variables associated with the ith offender 
sentenced by the jth judge in the kth cell. In this relatively 
simple model, the weight assigned to these additional factors 
(the column vector ?) is the weighted average over judges. 
(Weights are proportional to the number of offenders sentenced 
per judge.) To the extent that these variables explain some of 
the residual variance, sentencing decisions will be uniform 
(but different from the guidelines) and the distribution of e 
will be smaller. Provided it excludes clearly inappropriate 
considerations, such as race, thekijkX?term is not disparity; 
rather, it represents a judicial consensus of how the average 
sentence should vary systematically within a guideline cell.

Many A, B, and C variables exist, and it is impractical and 
arguably unnecessary to include all of the variables in a 
statistical model. ***Footnote 15 Some researchers have 
followed a tradition of introducing a presumably comprehensive 
set of explanatory variables into a regression. A problem with 
this approach is that it altogether ignores the structure 
imposed by the guidelines and replaces that known structure 
with a statistical search for the correct model. This is a 
daunting and uncertain exercise that we forego by anchoring our 
analysis on the guideline cell and then looking for systematic 
departures from that anchor***. Because the guidelines already 
factor most X ariables into the identification of the guideline 
cell (e.g., the seriousness of the offense and the danger posed 
by the offender), there is limited variation with which to base 
inferences. ***Footnote 16 For example, for property crimes the 
dollar value of the loss is a primary determinate of offense 
seriousness. But within a guideline cell, there is likely to be 
little variation in dollar loss. A regression (the statistical 
procedure used to estimate the parameters in equation [3]) will 
be uninformative when the independent variable (the X in the 
equation) has small variation***. Consequently, this study will 
make limited attempts to add X variables to the model, only 
incorporating them into the analysis when they are obviously 
important. Nevertheless, we know from reviewers’ comments on an 
earlier draft that the decision to include some X variables and 
exclude others is contentious, and we return to the issue in 
the next subsection.

So far, the discussion has considered residual variance within 
a guideline cell as variance that is unexplained by the 
legitimate factors (including knowledge of the applicable 
guideline cell) incorporated into the estimation. Unexplained 
residual variance is not the same as disparity, but it is 
probative. Expanding the model specification goes more directly 
to the issue:

[4] ijkkijkkijkijkeZXSS+++=??

The Z represents factors that Congress and the Commission 
recognize as inappropriate considerations during sentencing 
(see appendix A). For our purposes, the important Z variable is 
race.

Again, currently there is disagreement about the legal standing 
of the Commission’s policy statements, but we doubt that many 
readers would argue race--the principal focus of this analysis-
-is ever a valid consideration at the time of sentencing. Given 
the model represented by equation [4], interesting aspects of 
the problem are--

* Does the?in equation [4] differ from zero? The question is 
whether there is systematic difference across offenders in 
sentences with regard to race.

* In equation [4], after accounting for systematic differences 
in X (common rules used by judges for departing from the 
guidelines) and Z (race and other factors that should not be 
considered during sentencing), what is the residual variation 
in e (the average difference between the average sentence 
imposed within the guideline cell and the sentence actually 
imposed)?

* Has the residual variation in e changed over time?

An extension to [4] almost completes the modeling. Although the 
? and ? parameters vary across the guideline cells, as written 
in equation [4], the parameters are otherwise fixed as 
researchers frequently use that term with hierarchical linear 
models. An extension is to write the parameters as being 
random, so that [4] is written as [5]:

[5] ijkijkijkkijkijkeZXSS+++=??

Note that [4] and [5] are the same, except for the new 
subscripts that appear on the ? parameter. The appearance of 
the j subscripts allows for the weight that each individual 
judge assigns to the variable Z to vary. Some additional 
structure is required to understand this. Presuming for 
simplicity that Z is a single variable (a dummy variable 
representing the condition that the offender is black), we 
might express ? as a function of a new vector of variables W. 
***Footnote 17Model specifications need to provide additional 
variables for whites and other races entering the analysis. For 
simplicity, we do not show those additional races***.

[6] jWkijkkijkuW++=???

Here ijk?is the effect that being black has on the sentence 
within the kth cell. The ij Ware interesting variables that 
explain systematic patterns in the effects of race (being 
black) on sentences within the kth cell. This formulation is 
often called a hierarchical linear model or a random effect 
model. It decomposes the effect of race into three parts. 
Parameter k? captures the direct effect that race has on the 
sentence imposed. For example, this parameter might cause us to 
infer that, on average, black offenders receive longer prison 
terms than do white offenders, taking other factors into 
account. Paramete rWk? captures the effect of interacting race 
with some other variable W. For example, if the other variable 
(W) is the year when the sentence was imposed, this parameter 
might cause us to infer that, over time, black offenders 
receive prison terms that are increasingly longer than the 
terms received by white offenders, when taking other factors 
into account. This is helpful for studying trends. The first 
two decomposition effects are called fixed effects and a third 
is called a random effect. The random effect uj is attributable 
to the specific judge imposing a sentence. Statisticians might 
say that judge is nested within race, but regardless of the 
wording, the point is that judges have different reactions to 
an offender’s race. ***Footnote 18 One reviewer of an earlier 
draft of this report observed that researchers using 
hierarchical linear models typically follow our approach of 
identifying a variable, such as race, whose effect is 
allowed to vary with time, while other variables are presumed 
to have fixed effects. The reviewer’s objection is that this is 
a specification error. We grant the validity of this point but 
assert that justification for using this potentially 
misspecified model comes from the advantage of simplifying a 
model that otherwise would become so complex as to be 
uninterpretable***. 

A final question concerns what to include as X, Z, and W 
variables. The question has no simple answer and we know from 
reviewers’ comments that the answer is contentious. We explain 
our approach using the concept of bundling, explained in the 
next subsection.

****************************************
3.3 Race is bundled with other factors
****************************************

When studying racial disparity in sentencing, it is necessary 
to define race and racial disparity. The definition may be 
comparatively simple for a geneticist, who might observe that 
whites and blacks fundamentally share a genetic pool with a few 
differences that account for skin color; predisposition toward 
certain diseases, such as sickle cell anemia; and other 
factors. However, when used in the context of social responses 
to race, including criminal sentencing, race seems to mean 
something other than genetic variation.

Numerous studies show that blacks have been sociologically and 
economically disadvantaged; as a racial group, they have less 
education, lower earnings, more serious criminal records, and 
other factors distinguishable, on average, from whites. The 
authors of this report think of genetically defined race as 
being bundled with these social and economic factors.

When studying racial disparities in sentencing, we must make a 
decision: Should we seek to estimate a pure genetic race effect 
by controlling for the bundled factors? Or should we treat 
those bundled factors as inseparable from race and not account 
for them in the analysis? Or should we account for some of the 
bundled factors and ignore others? Reviewers of an earlier 
draft of this report had differing opinions.

We have a preferred approach, although we also attempted to 
accommodate different opinions. Overall, we prefer to study the 
effect of race as a bundle of factors, so that our analysis has 
a race variable but no control variables for education, 
employment, and other factors associated with race. With 
exceptions, identified and justified below, the only control 
variables are those recognized by the guidelines. ***Footnote 
19 One can argue that the Federal Sentencing Guidelines have a 
built-in, but not necessarily intentional, racial bias. The 
recently changed crack cocaine guidelines illustrate this 
built-in bias. As another example, blacks may acquire lengthier 
criminal histories than whites for reasons that have nothing to 
do with inherent criminality, and because the guidelines take 
criminal record into account, blacks may be disadvantaged. This 
study, which takes the guidelines as a normative standard, is 
not a study of built-in racial disparity***.

One exception is that we include a covariate that captures 
nuances in criminal records. To explain, the guidelines already 
identify criminal history categories, derived from collapsing 
more detailed criminal history scores. Because judges 
potentially see the criminal history scores, because the 
differences between these scores and the criminal history 
categories may be considered at the time of sentencing, and 
because criminal history is generally considered an appropriate 
consideration at sentencing, we included a transformation of 
the criminal history scores as covariates. The transformation 
is explained in section 5.1.

In addition to criminal history scores, our preferred model 
controls for the judicial circuit in the regression 
specification. Empirically, circuits that tend to sentence both 
white and black offenders harshly, compared to other circuits, 
tend to have a higher proportion of black offenders. Circuits 
that tend to sentence both white and black offenders leniently, 
compared to other circuits, tend to have a lower proportion of 
black offenders. Even if blacks suffered no racial disadvantage 
within every circuit, black offenders would appear to be 
disadvantaged at the national level if the circuit were not 
taken into account. In the case of circuits, we have unbundled 
circuit as a race attribute. This approach is arguable, so we 
have made accommodations in the form of sensitivity testing. 
While we focus attention on the regression specification with 
circuit dummy variables, we also report findings from a 
regression that lacks circuits as a control variable and from a 
regression that substitutes districts for circuits. ***Footnote 
20 One review noted that we should use districts to remove 
regional variations, and while the reviewer’s arguments are 
persuasive, the use of districts instead of circuits does not 
materially change results. We found that some models could not 
be estimated when district was substituted for circuit***.

Thus, our preferred model includes a transformed version of 
criminal history score and circuits as the X variables, but at 
the request of reviewers, we have added education and 
employment to the model to see if these factors account for 
some of the racial effect. We report findings as a sensitivity 
test of the preferred model.

Despite reviewer recommendations, we do not include covariates 
that may differentiate offenders within guideline cells. For 
example, the guidelines may place some property offenders and 
some drug-law violators into the same guideline cell. Despite 
the fact that these two types of offenders fall into the same 
guideline cell, judges may treat drug offenders more severely 
than property offenders. If drug offenders are more likely to 
be black, then failing to distinguish between property 
offenders and drug offenders within the same guideline cell may 
mistakenly associate valid reasons for sentence differences to 
race. From this perspective, the analysis should account for 
within-guideline differences in crimes.

While giving credit to this argument, we find it difficult to 
deal with the problem. The differences within guideline cells 
are idiosyncratic and accounting for them would require 
complicated statistical analysis that might obscure more than 
it explains.***Footnote 21 Reviewers have suggested adding 
dummy variables to account for offense type, but on reflection, 
this simple solution loses its appeal. Depending on the refinement 
of the offense type variable, certain offenses will appear in a 
limited number of guideline cells, where they will be proxies 
for those cells. The parameters associated with those dummy 
variables will not have their usual interpretation as shift 
parameters. The use of offense variables may introduce 
specification errors that actually mask race effects***. 
Furthermore, unless the intra-cell differences uniformly favor 
whites (or blacks) across all of the cells, the existence of 
those intra-cell differences will not bias estimates of black–
white disparity across the cells. Because we have no reason to 
presume that the guideline cells were constructed 
systematically to disadvantage blacks, we prefer to treat the 
intra-cell differences as essentially random across cells. We 
recognize that this argument will not satisfy all readers.***Footnote 
22 Furthermore, considering the bundling argument, the question about 
intra-cell variation may be unanswerable. In the property crime and 
drug crime example, one could plausibly argue that within a guideline 
cell, judges sentence drug offenders more severely because they are 
predominately black, while property offenders are predominately white***.

Although we adopt a simple model with few X variables, based on 
reading and discussions with others, we felt that the structure 
of equation [5] may differ across settings, an expectation 
confirmed by statistical testing. Evidence shows that females 
are sentenced less severely than are males. Some analysts might 
deal with this difference by using a dummy variable in a single 
regression to distinguish males from females, but we disagree 
with that approach. Adding a sex variable as a linear additive 
effect will not account for the fact that the ? and ? 
parameters differ for males and females. (The truth of this 
assertion is demonstrated when discussing empirical results.) 
Instead of using a dummy variable to distinguish sex, we 
partition the data into 14 strata (see section 4.1) and 
estimate separate regressions for each partition. The ? and ? 
parameters differ demonstrably across these partitions. As a 
result, we cannot simply add dummy variables as control 
variables.***Footnote 23 It is possible to specify a model 
that has interactions between the partitions and the ? and ? 
parameters, but that is essentially the same as estimating 
separate models for each partition***.

The disadvantage of this approach is that with 14 partitions, 
we have 14 results. However, this is only a bookkeeping 
disadvantage. As explained in the next section, the dependent 
variable is standardized. As a result, the parameters of 
interest are in the same units and can be averaged across 
partitions, allowing us to make summary statements about 
disparity in sentencing without reporting the results for all 
14 partitions.

********************************************************
4.0 Statistical methodology: A random effect model
*********************************************************

This methodology section has two components. The first section 
discusses estimation and the second section describes the data 
and variables used in the analysis.

*****************
4.1 Estimation
*****************

The previous section identified a theoretical model for 
measuring sentencing disparity. The model is potentially useful 
because it answers questions relevant to this study. 
Unfortunately, the model is not practically useful as written 
for two reasons: (1) there are too few observations per 
guideline cell to estimate parameters reliably and (2) there is 
no simple way to summarize results across the 258 guideline 
cells. Recognizing these problems, this section provides a 
model simplification that retains the important aspects of 
modeling already discussed.

We have defined ijkSas the sentenced imposed on the ith 
offender by the jth judge in the kth guideline cell. For 
reasons to be explained, it will be convenient and useful to 
rescale the sentence. LetkNbe the number of sentences imposed 
within cell k.

kkjiijkkNSM??=,

()1,2??=??kkjikijkkNMSSC

The notationkji?,means summation over all i and j in cell k. 
kMis the average sentence imposed in the kth cell. kSCis the 
standard deviation for sentences imposed within the kth cell. 

Then the rescaled measure of sentence is--
[7] k

This rescaled measure has two useful properties: (1) within any 
cell, the average rescaled sentence will be zero and (2) within 
any cell, the standard deviation for the rescaled sentence will 
be one. Using this rescaled version of the sentence, we write 
the model using all the cells as--

[8] jWijkijijkijijkijkijkuWeZXs++=++=?????0

Equation [8] looks similar to equation [5], but there are 
important differences:

* Equation [5] pertained to a specific guideline cell, while 
equation [8] applies to all guideline cells.

* In equation [5], the ? and ? have k subscripts, implying that 
those parameters vary from cell to cell, but the k subscript 
has been dropped in equation [8], implying that those 
parameters are invariant across the cells. Given 258 guideline 
cells, this reduces the parameter space by a multiple of 258, 
greatly reducing the estimation problem and providing a useful 
summary measure across cells. This simplification may be an 
incorrect specification, and we will subsequently introduce 
some model flexibility.

* Although we have retained the ? and ? notation, these are not 
the same parameters as those in equation [5]. Rescaling Sijk 
causes the interpretation of the parameters to change, so 
parameters are now interpreted as changes in standard deviation 
units. Although this is analytically convenient, readers may 
have trouble interpreting standard deviation units, but we will 
discuss how standard deviation units can be translated back 
into natural units to facilitate interpretation.

The dependent variable now has a mean of zero and a variance of 
one for every guideline cell, so treating the ? as the same 
across the cells is equivalent to saying that a unit change in 
variable X increases the sentence by ? standard deviations, 
regardless of the cell. Likewise, treating the ? as the same 
across the cells is equivalent to saying that a unit change in 
variable Z increases the sentence by ? standard deviations, 
regardless of the cell. Using standardized scores greatly 
simplifies interpretation of the statistical analysis because a 
standard deviation change is the same, regardless of the cell.

Although using standardized scores simplifies the model, the 
simplification may be an incorrect specification leading to 
misleading conclusions. We take two steps to guard against 
misspecification. The first step is to introduce the year when 
the sentence was imposed as a W variable. This allows us to 
determine whether the severity of sentences is increasing or 
decreasing over time.***Footnote 24 More accurately, given the 
model specification, we are able to determine whether sentence 
severity for white offenders is increasing or decreasing over 
time. The interaction of time with black offenders tells us how 
the sentences for black offenders relative to white offenders--
the measure of racial disparity--has changed over time***.  We 
also introduce the year when the sentences imposed interacted 
with the variable black as another W variable. This allows the 
proportionality of sentences imposed on white and black 
offenders to vary systematically across time. (For additional 
flexibility, we use a linear spline with the date of the Gall 
decision as the join point.) The second step is to introduce 
the maximum of the guideline cell as a W variable. This allows 
the proportionality of sentences imposed on white and black 
offenders to vary systematically across the guideline cells. 
Think of the statistical model as estimating a smoothed version 
of the relationship between sentences for white and black 
offenders across the guideline cells and over time.

An attractive feature of building a statistical model capturing 
variation in sentences for white and black offenders is that 
the results from the statistical model are readily expressed 
using figures.

The analysis will deal with special considerations. For 
relatively minor crimes committed by offenders with minor 
criminal records, there is a practical lower limit on the 
sentence imposed: Time served may be zero for offenders 
sentenced to probation. For comparatively serious crimes 
committed by offenders with major criminal records, there is a 
practical upper limit on the sentence imposed, and some 
sentences may be very long (e.g., when a judge imposes 
consecutive sentences). Researchers have struggled with ways to 
deal with censored variables (as the above problem is known in 
the econometrics literature (Sullivan, McGloin, & Piquero, 
2008; Britt, 2009; Ulmer, Light, & Kramer, 2011), but there is 
a special consideration for this study. Many of the solutions 
do not lend themselves to hierarchical modeling, at least not 
using conventional software. Examining sentences imposed under 
the guidelines, within most guideline cells, shows that most 
offenders receive jail or prison terms. We can include most 
guideline cells within the study by setting a rule: Include a 
cell when 85% or more of the offenders sentenced within the 
cell receive some prison time.***Footnote 25 This still leaves 
a lower limit problem, but a linear model will provide a 
consistent estimate of the average sentence when there is a 
lower limit. Standard errors are corrected using robust 
standard errors. The upper limits are a minor problem. A 
reviewer of an earlier draft disagreed with this statement, so 
some clarification is required. Using OLS when data are 
censored will lead to inconsistent estimates of the parameters 
in an underlying latent variable model, a problem discussed 
extensively in the econometrics literature. However, a 
correctly specified OLS model will be consistent for the 
conditional mean by definition. This distinction is discussed 
by Angrist and Pischke (2009), among others. Our claims about 
consistency pertain to the conditional mean***. Within each 
cell, sentences for offenders who received non-prison sentences 
are set to zero. (See the table at the beginning of appendix 
B.) Within each cell, sentences for offenders who received non-
prison sentences are set to zero. Adopting this allows us to 
use a linear hierarchical model for the analysis.***Footnote 
26 With exceptions, guidelines are not required for 
misdemeanors below class A misdemeanors. Consequently, the 
least serious federal crimes are not sentenced under the 
guidelines. U.S. Attorneys often employ declination standards 
that limit federal prosecution to serious crimes, and 
less serious crimes are referred to state courts. These two 
observations may explain why most federal offenders sentenced 
under the guidelines receive some prison time***.

Limiting the analysis to certain cells does not bias the 
analysis because selection is based on an exogenous variable: 
guideline cell***Footnote 27 One might argue that the 
guideline cell is not exogenous. The argument is that 
prosecutors wait to determine the judge appointed to the case 
and then manipulate the facts surrounding the case in 
recognition of judge sentencing proclivities. If this happens, 
the effect does not appear to be large (Yang, 2013), so we 
treat the guideline cell as exogenous***. However, we 
acknowledge that the findings pertain strictly to these 
included cells. We could have relaxed the inclusion rule, but 
dealing with probation terms requires special considerations. 
In the federal system, terms of probation typically come with 
onerous behavioral restrictions, including house arrest and 
electronic monitoring. When only a few sentences are to 
probation, we do not set the sentence to zero. However, if a 
larger number of probation sentences were included, we would 
have to deal with the terms of probation varying in severity. 
***Footnote 28 Some reviewers of an earlier version of this 
report encouraged us to extend the analysis to probation terms, 
suggesting that we estimate separate regressions with binary 
outcomes (e.g., logistic or probit models). We see the required 
analysis as more difficult than suggested by the reviewers, and 
resource and time limitations precluded taking probation 
sentences into account***.

Expecting application of the guidelines to vary across certain 
offense and offender groups, we partition our data into 14 
strata. ***Footnote 29 One might argue that there should be 
more or fewer partitions. In its study of the use of mandatory 
minimum penalties across 13 districts, the USSC partitioned 
offenses into drug offenses, firearm offenses, and child 
pornography offenses (Commission, 2011, pp. 111-115--ssentially 
the same partitioning that we have used. The Commission also 
distinguished aggravated identity theft, but we did not make 
that partition because there are too few cases to treat these 
as a partition. Separate analyses are performed within each 
stratum. The strata are defined as follows:

* The USSC makes a useful distinction between upward departures 
(always attributable to the judge), downward departures that 
are attributable to the judge, and downward departures that are 
attributable to the government. ***Footnote 30 A departure is a 
sentence that is higher than the upper guidelines limit or 
lower than the lower guidelines limit. Downward departures 
attributable to the government are legitimate rewards for 
cooperating with the government to further criminal cases 
against others. It seems best to assume that departures 
attributable to the government fundamentally alter the 
application of the guidelines. As a result, the analysis 
described above (and illustrated below) should be done 
separately for cases that have departures attributable to the 
government and for cases that do not have departures 
attributable to the government. We make that distinction for 
this study, so the explanation of sentence variation is found 
exclusively in judicial decision making.

* Federal criminal law always sets an upper limit on the 
sentence and, for some crimes, federal criminal law sets a 
lower limit greater than zero. Mandatory minimum sentences are 
especially likely for drug violations, and these mandatory 
minimums are often so severe that Congress has provided 
provisions allowing judges to ignore the mandatory minimums for 
a class of offenders (see appendix A). Weapons enhancements, 
which often trigger mandatory minimum sentences, are 
incorporated into the guidelines. The rules for sentencing drug 
offenders, those who receive weapons enhancements, and other 
offenders are so different that we have created a second 
partition determined by four broad offense categories:

- drug violations that do not involve weapons enhancement

- nondrug violations that do not involve weapons enhancements

- drug violations that involve weapons enhancements

- nondrug violations that involve weapons enhancements.

In the federal system, sex offenses are mostly for child 
pornography, and most of the convictions for sex offenses are 
of white offenders. As a result, analyzing disparity among sex 
offenses is of little interest. Nondrug violations account for 
all nondrug crimes, excluding sex offenses. However, when 
examining sentence variation across judges, where race is not a 
consideration, sex offenses make up their own class.

* Although being male or female is not a legitimate 
consideration according to guideline policy statements, sex has 
an important effect on sentence imposed. This justifies 
treating sex as a stratifying variable.

Females are rare participants in offenses that involve weapons 
enhancements. As a result, every partition involving females 
and weapons enhancements is treated as null. Also, females are 
rarely participants in sex violations. In summary, ignoring sex 
violations, we partition the data into 12 subsets: eight 
subsets for males and four subsets for females. We repeat the 
same analyses for each of the 12 subsets. When estimating the 
skedastic function, we use all 14 cells because race is not a 
factor for the skedastic function.

The principal analysis eliminates noncitizens. The treatment of 
noncitizens differs from the treatment of citizens for at least 
four reasons. First, the guidelines factors—especially those 
required to construct the criminal history category--are likely 
to be imprecise for noncitizens. Second, noncitizens can be 
deported, so the stakes at issue are different for citizens and 
noncitizens. Third, race appears to be inaccurately reported 
for noncitizens, who are (according to the data) predominately 
white Hispanics. Fourth, fast-track provision introduces a 
complication that requires special attention going beyond the 
analysis reported in this study (McClellan & Sands, 2006; 
Gorman, 2010; Cole, 2012). Consequently, we drop noncitizens 
from the principal analysis, but given that noncitizens are a 
large proportion of federal offenders, we report a preliminary 
analysis of noncitizens in appendix C.

*************************
4.2 Data and variables
*************************

The USSC maintains a detailed database pertaining to the 
application of guidelines; this study uses an extract of 
variables from those data. The box below lists the specific 
variables from the USSC database that entered into our 
analysis. This list allows interested readers to track 
variables back to the USSC’s data.

The box puts variables into three categories. The first 
category includes stratification variables that were used to 
identify the 14 strata and to determine if an offender was a 
U.S. citizen. The second category--the dependent variable--is 
the sentence. The third category identifies variables used to 
determine independent variables.

**********************************************************
**************************
Stratification variables
*************************

FEMALE--A variable coded by the USSC that equals 1 if the 
offender is female.

REAS*--The first, second, etc. reason given by the court for 
why the sentence imposed was outside the range (there are 10 
variables, for REAS1 to REAS10). The value indicating 
substantial assistance is “19” ((5K 1.1) substantial assistance 
with government motion). These departures are explained in 
appendix A.

BookerCD--An additional variable used to identify a handful of 
additional substantial assistance cases. The post-Booker 
reporting categories (there are 12 categories) are based on the 
relationship between the sentence and guideline range and the 
reason(s) given for being outside of the range. The value 
indicating substantial assistance is “5.”

OFFTYPE2--The offense type variable used to determine drug 
offenders (values “10,” ”11,” and ”12”) and sex offenders 
(values “4,” ”28,” ”42,” ”43,” and “44”).

WEAPON--Used to identify weapons offenders. It is a USSC-
created variable, where 1 indicates the offender received a 
specific offense characteristics (SOC) weapons enhancement or 
had an 18:924(C) charge present.

NEWCIT--Used to identify U.S. citizens. The value “0” indicates 
a U.S. citizen.
*****************************************************

*****************************************************
********************
Dependent variable
********************

TOTPRISN--The total number of months of imprisonment ordered. 
Sentences of less than 1 month are coded as zero. In its 
analysis, the USSC chose to include alternative sentences 
(i.e., home confinement, community confinement, and 
intermittent confinement), but these alternatives are not 
considered to be prison terms in our analysis. This variable is 
top-coded at 470 months, meaning that any sentence in excess of 
470 months (including life terms and death sentences) are 
recoded to 470 months.

***********************
Independent variables
***********************

XCRHISSR--The offender’s final criminal history category (I–
VI), as determined by the court. The guidelines translate the 
total criminal history points into the six categories defined 
by the criminal history category.

XFOLSOR--The final offense level, as determined by the court. 
The combination of XCRHISSR and XFOLSOR indicates the guideline 
cell.

MONRACE--The race of the offender: white, black, and other 
race. Race is independent of Hispanic ethnicity. Note that 
while our findings are focused on non-Hispanic whites and non-
Hispanic blacks or African Americans, the analysis uses data 
representing all races identified by the USSC. We removed any 
offender with an unreported race from the analysis.

HISPORIG--An indication of Hispanic ethnicity. We designate an 
offender as Hispanic if this variable is coded “2” (i.e., we 
consider an offender of Hispanic ethnicity only if there is an 
indication of Hispanic origin).

XMAXSOR--The maximum guidelines range for imprisonment, as 
determined by the court. When used in the analysis, XMAXSOR is 
recoded to a maximum of 470 (including life terms) and is 
rescaled by dividing by 470. The recoded variable runs from 0 
to 1.

SENTYR--The year the sentence was imposed. When used in this 
analysis, 

SENTYR--is recoded from 2005-2012, to 0- 1 by subtracting 2005 
and dividing by 7.

We allow the time trend to break near the Gall v. United States 
decision. Since it was decided on December 10, 2007, we allowed 
the break for sentences filed beginning on January 1, 2008.

TOTCHPTS--The offender’s total criminal history points. To 
capture the variation of criminal history with each criminal 
history level that may explain differences in sentencing, we 
use the criminal history points interacted with the offender’s 
criminal history level (XCRHISSR). In particular, for every 
offender, we standardize his or her criminal history points 
within the offender’s criminal history level. For example, if 
an offender has a criminal history level of III, his or her 
criminal history points are standardized with all other 
offenders that have a criminal history level of III. Then, we 
interact the standardized history points with the criminal 
history categories and insert this measure into the statistical 
models (as six variables, for each of the six criminal history 
categories).

NEWCNVTN--Indicates that the adjudication decision was reached 
by a trial. This variable enters the model as a covariate.

MONCIRC--Indicates the judicial circuit in which the offender 
was sentenced. We used fixed effects to indicate the judicial 
circuit, using the 9th judicial circuit as a reference 
category.

CIRCDIST--Indicates the judicial district in which the offender 
was sentenced.

JUDGE--A unique identifier assigned to a judge, used as a 
random effect in the statistical models.
***************************************************

For the analyses, we use USSC data for all offenders who were 
sentenced cases where government-initiated departures were not 
a factor from cases where government-initiated departures were 
a factor, we inspected the variables REAS1 through REAS10. If 
any of these variables reported “(5K 1.1) substantial 
assistance with government motion,” then we assigned the case 
to the government-initiated departure category. The BookerCD 
variable identified a few additional government-sponsored 
downward departures.

We identified the guideline cells by interacting the variables 
XFOLSOR and XCRHISSR. We computed the percentage of cases 
within each cell that resulted in prison and we discarded all 
cells where that rate was lower than 85%. Others (Ulmer, Light, 
& Kramer, 2011) have considered disparity in the imposition of 
prison terms, and we do not investigate that question.
The dependent variable is a transformation of TOTPRISN. The 
transformation was described earlier using the formula:

kkijkijkSCMSs?=

Substitute TOTPRISN forijkS.

**********************************
5.0 Analysis and interpretation
**********************************

Results are presented in two sections. The first section on 
sentencing disparity is divided into four subsections that 
pertain to the research questions raised in the introduction. 
Regression results are reported in appendices B and D; appendix 
C reports analyses for noncitizens. The second section pertains 
to prosecutorial discretion; this section tests whether the 
exercise of prosecutorial discretion has changed during the 
study period. Additional analyses regarding prosecutorial 
discretion appear in appendix D.

Statistical output is voluminous; therefore, to assist the 
reader, we have taken the following steps in this section. 
First, we interpret the statistical results in detail for the 
analysis of one partition of the data. Interested readers can 
apply that interpretation to the tables appearing in appendices 
B and C. Second, we provide summary statements that appear in 
bold. These summary statements take advantage of the 
standardization of the dependent variable, which allows 
parameters to be averaged across strata. When we average, we 
take a simple average across the strata. Third, we report 
sensitivity testing in exhibits 1 to 3.

**************************************************
5.1 Operational variables entering the analysis
**************************************************

Estimation uses a multilevel mixed-effects linear model 
programmed as procedure mixed in version 13 of Stata. (This is 
xtmixed in earlier versions of Stata.) This section explains 
the modeling, interpretation, and presentation of results. (See 
appendix B for detailed findings and appendix C for results of 
analysis of noncitizens.)

As described previously, the dependent variable is the rescaled 
total months of prison imposed. The fixed effects are:

Race/Ethnicity: Black--This is a dummy variable that is coded 
one when the offender is black and coded zero otherwise. White 
offenders are the omitted category. Hispanic and other enter 
into the analysis, but we will not discuss these racial or ethnic 
categories separately because modeling for them is identical to 
modeling for blacks.

year_pregall--Calendar time is modeled with a linear spline. 
This variable models calendar time up to the Gall decision. 
Calendar time has been recoded to run from 0 at the beginning 
of the observation period to 1 at the end of the observation 
period.

year_postgall--This variable models calendar time after the 
Gall decision.

Black x Year Pre-2008--This is the year_pregall variable 
interacted with the Race/Ethnicity: Black variable.

Black x Year Post-2008--This is the year_postgall variable 
interacted with the Race/Ethnicity: Black variable.

Note that the parameters associated with the last two variables 
allow us to estimate how the sentencing disparity for white and 
black offenders has changed over time. Interpreting these 
parameter estimates is the principal concern of this study.

Max Sentence in Guideline Cell--This is the maximum sentence 
specified for the guideline cell. It has been top coded at 470 
months and rescaled to run from 0 to 1.

Black x Max--Sentence This is Max Sentence in the guideline cell 
interacted with the Race/Ethnicity: Black variable.

The introduction of these two variables relaxes the restrictive 
model specification by allowing the degree of racial disparity 
to vary across the guideline cells. Possible disparity is 
pronounced within guideline cells that call for relatively 
short sentences but is insignificant for guideline cells that 
call for comparatively long sentences. The use of the above two 
variables expands the model’s flexibility, and the parameters 
associated with the last variable estimate how disparity varies 
across the guideline cells.

Newcnvtn--This is a dummy variable indicating that the 
offender was convicted by trial.

c_pts_n--There are six of these criminal history point 
variables distinguished by allowing n to run from 1 to 6.

The c_pts_n variable requires comment: Guideline calculations 
assign criminal history points based on the offender’s criminal 
record and then collapse the criminal history points into six 
criminal history levels that form one dimension of the 
guideline grid. Because of the collapsing, actual criminal 
histories are heterogeneous within guideline cells, and the 
c_pts_n variables take that heterogeneity into account. For 
example, c_pts_1 is the standardized criminal history points 
for offenders whose criminal history is classified in the first 
criminal history category. If the typically subtle distinctions 
in criminal history category matter at the time of sentencing, 
the parameters associated with the c_pts_n variables should be 
positive. Except as control variables, these parameters are 
of no interest to this study.

circ_n--There are 11 dummy variables, distinguished by 
allowing n to run from 1 to 11, that denote the circuit. The 
ninth circuit is the omitted reference category.

Additionally, a sequence number distinguishing judge identity 
(JUDGE) enters the model as a random effect. For every judge, 
there is a judge random effect for white and black offenders.

**********************************************
5.2 Findings regarding sentencing disparity
**********************************************

Table 1 reports selected regression results***Footnote 31 The 
data include Hispanic and other offenders, but they are not of 
principal interest for this report; therefore, results 
pertaining to Hispanic and others are suppressed. Similarly, we 
suppress the random effects for these two racial and ethnic 
groups. We also suppress the fixed circuit effects. Complete 
results appear in appendix B***. for the regression using the 
data partition males, no drug violations or weapons 
enhancements, and no government-sponsored departures for 
substantial assistance.***Footnote 32 We only show the 
parameter estimates that are of interest for estimating racial 
disparity. The appendix shows complete regression results***. 
This partition includes 76,405 offenders who were sentenced by 
1,292 judges. An average judge sentenced 60 offenders from this 
partition, but some sentenced only a single offender and at 
least 1 judge sentenced 460 offenders. All of the shaded 
results are statistically significant at p < 0.01.

The first column in table 1 identifies selected variables that 
entered the regression. The table identifies the parameter in 
the first column and reports the parameter estimate in the 
second column, a heteroscedastic robust standard error in the 
third column, and a 95% confidence interval in the last two 
columns. When the confidence interval does not overlap 0, the 
parameter is deemed statistically significant at p < 0.05. The 
shading denotes parameters that are statistically significant 
at p < 0.01.

The first two parameter estimates are associated with the 
variables “year_pregall” and “year_postgall.” Collectively, 
these provide a spline telling us how sentences have changed 
for white offenders between 2005 and 2012. These two parameters 
tell us roughly that the sentences imposed on white offenders 
have decreased by -(3/8)x0.246-(5/8)x0.207=-0.222 standardized 
units between 2005 and 2012. This change is statistically 
significant at p < 0.01. For white males convicted of crimes 
other than drug violations and weapons offenses, and who did 
not provide substantial assistance to the government, sentences 
became more lenient between 2005 and 2012.

Moreover, based on the results reported in appendix B, 
examining the estimated changes over the 8-year period, it 
appears that white males and females received sentences that 
decreased in severity. When we include sex offenders in the 
analysis, there is an estimated reduction in 13 of 14 strata. 
The change is statistically significant at p < 0.01 in six 
tests and at p < 0.05 in another three tests. Given that the 
dependent variable is measured in standardized units, the 
changes appear large: The simple average change over the 14 
strata is -0.22 standardized units, which is significant at p < 
0.001. Apparently, judges have exercised discretion during the 
post-Booker era to reduce the average length of time that 
offenders serve in prison. Although overall trends in sentences 
are not the main concern of this report, we note that the study 
is being conducted within an overall context of increasing 
leniency in federal sentencing. Sensitivity testing reported in 
exhibit 1 indicates that findings are insensitive to model 
specification.

Our interest is principally focused on the parameters 
associated with Black x Year Pre-2008 and Black x Year Post-
2008 because these parameters estimate how disparity (the 
difference between the average sentence for blacks and whites) 
has changed over time. From Booker to Gall, the disparity 
increased (p < 0.01), but it does not appear to have changed 
any more since Gall. To consider the entire period post-Booker, 
see the parameter associated with Trend from 2005 to 2012. Over 
the entire post-Booker period, the sentences imposed on black 
offenders have increased by 0.146 standardized units, an amount 
that is statistically significant at p < 0.01. Interestingly, 
we previously reported that the sentences imposed on white 
offenders decreased by 0.222 standardized units, and now we 
report that racial disparity in sentencing has increased by 
0.146 standardized units, implying that blacks did not receive 
harsher sentences between 2005 and 2012; rather, blacks have 
not benefited as much from the increased leniency afforded to 
whites, and this has widened disparity.

***************************************************************
************************************
Exhibit 1. There has been a trend 
toward more lenient sentences
************************************

In the preferred model, sentence severity for white offenders 
decreased by an average of 0.222 standardized units between 
2005 and 2012 (p < 0.01). When the model substitutes district 
fixed effects for circuit fixed effects, the estimated decrease 
in overall sentence severity is 0.194 standardized units (p < 
0.01). When fixed effects are omitted from the model, the 
decrease is 0.226 (p < 0.01). Returning to the preferred model 
and including age and education as covariates, we find that 
sentence severity fell by 0.215 standardized units (p < 0.01). 
The decrease in sentence severity for white offenders appears 
robust to model specification.

***************************************************************

Excluding sex offenses (because there are few black sex 
offenders) in all eight strata where we contrasted the 
sentences for black males and white males, the trends in 
sentences for black males were increasingly longer than the 
sentences for white males. The contrast was statistically 
significant at p < 0.01 in four of the eight contrasts, and it 
was significant at p < 0.05 in a fifth. The simple average 
across the eight contrasts showed that at the end of 2012, 
blacks received sentences that were 0.173 standardized units 
higher than their white counterparts, a difference that was 
statistically significant at p < 0.01. Evidence reported in 
exhibit 2 indicates that these findings are robust to model 
specification. We do not find that black females are 
disadvantaged compared with white females.

***************************************************************
**************************************
Exhibit 2. Sentencing disparity has 
increased for black males 
**************************************

Using the preferred model with circuit fixed effects, 
sentencing disparity has increased by an average of 0.173 
standardized units (p < 0.01). Exchanging districts for 
circuits, we estimate that sentencing disparity has increased 
by an average of 0.161 standardized units (p < 0.01). Dropping 
both circuits and districts from the model specification, 
sentencing disparity increased by an estimated 0.190 
standardized units (p < 0.01). Using the preferred model, but 
including age and education in the model specification, the 
increase is 0.168 standardized units (p < 0.01). Findings 
regarding trends in disparity are robust to model 
specification.
*****************************************************************

According to the Black x Max Sentence parameter, the 
disadvantage suffered by blacks decreases as the maximum 
sentence for a guideline cell increases. This does not mean 
that blacks are disadvantaged for minor crimes and advantaged 
for serious crimes; rather, the statistics imply that the 
disadvantage between blacks and whites narrows as crimes become 
more serious.

Table 1 also reports random effects holding the judicial 
circuitconstant. ***Footnote 33 Differences across circuits are 
large. Averaging across the 14 partitions (including sex 
offenses), the second circuit sentence is an average of 0.46 
standard deviation units below the national average and the 
fifth circuit sentences are an average of 0.31 standard 
deviation units above the national average. That disparity is 
much larger than the racial disparity reported in this 
study***. Statistical modeling assumes that judges differ 
regarding the sentences imposed on white offenders, the sizes 
of those differences are randomly distributed across judges, 
and that distribution is normal. The variance for that 
distribution is 0.075, which appears to be large in terms of 
standardized sentences. The confidence interval is tight about 
this estimate. Likewise, judges differ regarding sentences 
imposed on blacks. The variance for that distribution is 0.077, 
and again, that variance seems large in terms of standardized 
sentences. Observe that the correlation between the random 
effect across judges for whites and the random effect 
across judges for blacks is very high: 0.808.

Looking across the 14 strata and converting from variances to 
standard deviations, on average the standard deviation for the 
random judge effect is 0.36 for whites and 0.40 for blacks (see 
exhibit 3). This is evidence of high disparity in general: 
Judges who impose above average prison terms on black offenders 
tend to impose above average prison terms on white offenders, 
and judges who impose below average prison terms on white 
offenders tend to impose below average prison terms on black 
offenders. In this regard, sentences are disparate in the sense 
that similarly situated offenders who have committed similar 
crimes receive sentences that differ depending on the judge who 
imposes the sentence.***Footnote 34 Generalizing this statement 
is difficult because we could only estimate covariances for four 
of the regressions. This is a practical limitation of working 
with random effect models. The correlation was close to 0.85 
in three regressions and closer to 0.6 in one regression. 
In standard deviation units, the random effects are 15% to 
20% larger for females than for males, implying that judges 
disagree more about the sentences to impose on females than 
the sentences to be imposed on males.

***************************************************************
********************************************
Exhibit 3. Judges disagree about sentences 
********************************************

According to the preferred model, when sentencing whites, the 
distribution of judge random effects has a standard deviation 
of 0.36 on average across 12 data partitions. When sentencing 
blacks, the standard deviation is 0.40. (There is no change 
when age and education are added to the model.) As expected, 
when district is substituted for circuit, the standard 
deviations for the random effects fall to 0.23 for whites and 
0.30 for blacks because the districts account for more residual 
variance than do the circuits. Likewise, when neither district 
nor circuit enters the model, the standard deviations for judge 
random effects increase to 0.44 for whites and 0.50 for blacks. 
These patterns are expected because circuit fixed effects 
account for some of the residual variance otherwise attributed 
to judges and district fixed effects account for even more of 
the residual.
***************************************************************

Although the analysis reported in table 1 pertains to a 
regression using the standardized scores for sentences, 
estimates based on these results are readily translated back 
into the original metric of months sentenced by reversing the 
transformation represented by equation [7]. We have applied 
this reverse transformation when producing the figures reported 
below.

*******************************************
5.2.1 Converting findings on disparity
from standardized units to original units
*******************************************

Statistical testing shows that the table 1 parameters 
associated with time interacted with blacks (Black x Year Pre-
2008 and Black x Year Post-2008) imply positive, statistically 
significant trends. Apparently, blacks have been increasingly 
disadvantaged over time. The parameters are difficult to 
interpret, but they can be translated into natural units 
(months) and their implications can be graphed. Graphing also 
allows us to extend findings to other partitions of the data.

Figure 2 represents trends in racial disparity for the first 
four partitions of data: Males convicted of crimes that do not 
involve weapons violations, both with and without substantial 
assistance to the government. The horizontal axis in each panel 
is the year that the sentence was imposed. When we translate 
backwards from standardized units to original units, we have to 
make the translation for specific guideline cells. (The 
translation first multiplies by the standard deviation of 
sentences within a cell and then adds the mean for that cell.) 
The translation is reported for maximum guideline sentences at 
the break for the first quartile of cells used in the analysis, 
for the mean, and at the break for the third quartile. For 
example, in the first panel (males, no drugs or weapons, and no 
substantial assistance), a quarter of offenders were sentenced 
under guidelines calling for maximum sentences of 33 months or 
less, half were sentenced under guidelines calling for maximum 
sentences of 46 months or less, and a quarter were sentenced 
under guidelines calling for maximum sentences of 87 months or 
more. The quartile breaks differ across the data partitions.

The first two panels appear to show a sharp break at the Gall 
decision. (We reference panels from left to right and then from 
top to bottom.) We are not inclined to take the break 
seriously, as it could result from our decision to place the 
knot for the spline at the time of Gall. A different placement 
might show a different pattern, but our principal concern is 
with the level of disparity at the end of 2012, and the 
estimates at the end of the period should be relatively 
insensitive to the placement of the knot. All four panels agree 
that disparity increased from 2005 to 2012, although the change 
is not statistically significant in the fourth panel. If we 
consider all panels jointly, giving each an equal weight in the 
calculations, we find they are jointly significant at p < 
0.01.

The next set of four partitions (figure 3) pertains to males 
convicted of crimes that involve weapons enhancements. Some of 
these crimes are drug-related and others are not. Again, we 
distinguish between cases where the offender was rewarded for 
substantial assistance to the government and cases where there 
was no reward for substantial assistance.

The figure shows patterns of increasing racial disparity for 
offenses that involve weapons enhancement. The increases are 
not statistically significant when offenders receive reductions 
for substantial assistance to the government, but the increases 
are always positive. If we consider the four trends jointly, 
they are statistically significant at p < 0.05.

Results for females are different. There are too few cases 
involving females with weapons violations to allow testing. 
Considering the four offenses without weapons enhancements, one 
partition shows a statistically significant (p < 0.05) trend 
while the other three do not, and the joint effect is not 
statistically significant. We do not graph the results. 
Increasing racial disparity in sentencing appears to be limited 
to males.

Although other factors may have been changing during this same 
8-year period, a subsection on “evidence of prosecutorial 
discretion” (see section 5.3) does not find trends in 
prosecutorial behavior, causing us to discount prosecutorial 
behavior as the cause of increasing disparity. Other 
explanations are plausible, but it seems reasonable to conclude 
these trends could be attributed to judicially induced 
disparity in the treatment of black offenders, compared to 
white offenders.

Some reviewers of an earlier draft were concerned that findings 
might be sensitive to the choice of a linear spline and 
suggested replacing the linear spline with an alternative 
approach. The data definitely suggest that the trend is 
nonlinear, so using a simple linear trend would be a 
misspecification. (One of the reviewers performed a reanalysis 
using the methodology of Ulmer, Light, & Kramer (2011), 
reporting that the trend was positive post-Booker and then 
appears to have reached a plateau, consistent with the spline.) 
We tried using a polynomial but--as often happens with 
polynomials--the end points seem uninformative and perhaps 
misleading about the trend as it nears 2012. A nonparametric 
alternative is to substitute dummy variables for every post-
Booker year. Figures 4 and 5 are the exact counterparts to 
figures 2 and 3, with dummy year variables substituted for the 
spline.

Readers can bring their own interpretations to figures 4 and 5. 
There is considerable random fluctuation from year to year, 
which is why we employed a smoothing technique--linear splines-
-to provide a summary. (We discourage readers from making much 
of year-to-year changes.) Some of the figures suggest why using 
polynomials can be misleading: There are apparently random 
spikes in the latter years. Our interpretation is that the 
general trend toward increasing racial disparity seems to reach 
a rough plateau sometime after the Gall decision. The linear 
splines appear to be reasonably consistent with this 
interpretation.

5.2.2 Racial disparity across guideline cells
***********************************************

Allowing the sentences to vary across the guideline cells is of 
some importance for model specification (significant in 5 of 14 
partitions), but this finding is not of substantive interest.
***Footnote 35 By construction, the mean sentence is zero 
across the guideline cells. Given the regression specification, 
the statement pertains to the variation in average sentences 
for whites across the guideline cells***. Racial disparity is 
statistically significant at p < 0.01 in 3 of 12 comparisons. 
We do not consider this to be an important finding. The signs 
of coefficients associated with the race effect vary, and the 
coefficients are statistically significant in only 3 of 12 
comparisons. The results are sensitive to model specification. 
Evidence is that standardizing the sentences has been useful 
for model specification.

**************************************
5.2.3 Racial disparity across judges
**************************************

Table 1 also reports random-effects parameters. We have already 
discussed those findings by presenting variance estimates in 
standardized units, and this subsection provides a visual 
impression after converting back to original units. Random 
effects may be difficult to interpret, so some intuition may be 
useful. The fixed effects (i.e., all of the parameters except 
the random effects) provide an estimate of the average sentence 
imposed on white and black offenders, conditional on the facts 
surrounding the case. Given that average, we can estimate the 
amount by which an individual judge differs from the average 
when sentencing black offenders and when sentencing white 
offenders. These estimated differences are the random effects. 
Subtracting the random effect for a judge when sentencing a 
white offender from the random effect for a judge when 
sentencing a black offender translates the random effects into 
a difference score--how much a judge sentences blacks more 
severely than whites.

The statistical model assumes that the random effects are 
distributed as bivariate normal. This is probably not exactly 
true, but we assume it is sufficiently approximate that we can 
graph the implied difference scores. By construction, the 
difference scores are themselves distributed as normal, 
explaining why the graph in figure 6 has the familiar shape of 
a normal distribution.

This discussion is focused on three parameters: the variance in 
judge effects for whites()2w?, the variance in judge effects 
for blacks()2b?, and the correlation in the judge effects for 
whites and blacks()wb?. The variance for the distribution of 
differences in effects for whites and blacks is()wbbw???222?+. 
Because the analysis was done using standardized sentences, the 
disagreement across judges in sentences for blacks is large, 
***Footnote 36 The analysis reported in table 1 was based on 
transformed sentences, where the distribution of sentences 
within a guideline cell had a mean of zero and a standard 
deviation of one. The judge random effects are scaled according 
to these unitary standardized deviations, suggesting that the 
random effects are large***. but then so too is the 
disagreement across judges in sentences for whites. Furthermore, 
when we were able to compute the correlation in the effects for 
blacks and whites, that correlation is high. The story is that 
some judges typically apply relatively harsh sentences to both 
blacks and whites, while other judges typically apply relatively 
lenient sentences to both blacks and whites. This is disparity 
but it is not necessarily racial 
disparity.

When we performed the analysis with all of the data (as 
reported previously), we discovered that the covariance 
estimate was unstable. We could improve the estimates by 
limiting the data to judges who sentenced at least five 
offenders. The results we present below pertain to the random 
effects after imposing that data limitation. Even with this 
data restriction, we could not always estimate a covariance 
reliably. We only present figures when a covariance estimate 
was available. Figure 6 represents the variance for males 
convicted of non-weapons violations. Figure 7 is similar but 
pertains to females.

Figures 6 and 7 aid in interpreting regression results. For 
reasons already discussed, we draw the distribution of the 
difference scores for three levels of guideline cells. These 
levels are at the 25th, median, and 75th percentiles of the 
maximum sentence lengths of the guideline cells. For each 
judge, we compute the difference in predicted sentences for 
blacks and whites for the three sentence lengths. The two 
figures depict the extent of disagreement across judges 
regarding the sentencing of white and black offenders. The 
horizontal axis reports the difference in months of the 
predicted difference in sentence lengths for black and white 
offenders for each judge. The vertical axis reports the density 
of the distribution. The estimates are highly inferential and 
intended to approximate and illustrate the extent to which 
federal judges disagree about sentences by race.

By construction, the judge random effects are centered on zero. 
The differences in random effects will also be centered on 
zero. However, for purposes of data visualization, we have 
centered them on the mean differences in sentence for black and 
white offenders.

Thus, for males, we observe that the centers of the 
distributions are all above zero. Blacks receive longer 
sentences than whites for the average judge; for females, the 
distributions are centered near zero because female white and 
black offenders receive similar terms. The distributions are 
approximations, but if we took them literally, we would 
conclude that judges tend to sentence blacks more severely than 
they sentence whites. For some judges, the sentencing disparity 
seems especially large, while for others it seems substantively 
insignificant. For a few judges, blacks appeared to be 
advantaged compared to whites, and while this may be true, the 
advantage typically appears to be small, and it may occur 
because we have used the bivariate normal as a useful 
approximation of reality.

If judges sentenced blacks and whites to equivalent terms, 
conditional on the facts surrounding the case, the 
distributions of the difference in sentences for blacks and 
whites would collapse to zero. This does not happen. (Table 1 
provides a test of the null hypothesis that these distributions 
have a variance of zero, meaning that they collapse to zero. 
The test rejects the null, although we recognize that the 
estimated variance has a large confidence interval, so there is 
some uncertainty about the spread of these distributions.) It 
seems likely that black and white offenders differ 
systematically in ways that cause judges to sentence them 
differently and, if we could observe those differences, the 
sentencing differences might be appropriate under the rule of 
law. However, that does not explain why some judges sentence 
blacks especially severely compared to whites. Unobserved, 
systematic differences between whites and blacks 
cannot account for the fact that the average difference in 
sentences for black and white offenders varies across judges.

**************************************************************
5.2.4 Increases in disparity: Variance about the guidelines
**************************************************************

We re-estimated the regression discussed previously without the 
judge random effects. From the regression, we estimated the 
squared residual, equal to2ijkein the notation used earlier. 
***Footnote 37 Our intent is to examine changes in the variance 
of the regression***. Then we regressed the squared residual on 
the linear splines representing post-Booker trends and onto the 
maximum sentence specified by the guidelines. Table 2 shows the 
results of repeating this exercise for the 12 partitions of the 
data.

As noted previously, we can estimate how dispersion has 
increased about the average as of 2012 by weighting and summing 
year_pregall and year_postgall parameters. Standard error 
calculations are provided in the table. Except for the weapons 
violations, the trends are toward higher dispersion and all 
trends are statistically significant at p < 0.05 or better. 
Post-Booker, we previously saw that sentencing has become more 
lenient. We now see that it has become more disparate. 
Excluding weapons violations, similarly situated offenders 
convicted of similar crimes are increasingly sentenced 
differently. As a robustness check, we find that the 
qualitative patterns (and tests of statistical significance) do 
not change when district fixed effects are included in the 
model.

*****************************************
5.3 Evidence of prosecutorial discretion
*****************************************

Because prosecutors exercise wide discretion to charge and 
bargain with offenders, prosecutorial discretion may be 
exercised to disadvantage blacks. That possibility is difficult 
to discount using FJSP data because FJSP data do not provide a 
rich description of offenses and offenders at the time 
prosecution is initiated. The full story may not emerge before 
a federal probation officer writes a presentence investigation 
report based on a narrative of the crime provided by a law 
enforcement source, a criminal record check, and interviews 
with the offender and his or her associates. Furthermore, the 
current version of FJSP data provides limited means to link 
data from the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys with sentenced 
offenders, so any study using Executive Office data necessarily 
works with a selected dataset.

Even if U.S. Attorneys treat blacks differently than whites, it 
is nevertheless difficult to discount the findings reported in 
the previous section. If federal prosecutors discriminate 
against blacks, and if judges could somehow recognize that 
differential treatment,***Footnote 38 The federal probation 
officer prepares a presentence investigation report for the 
judge. The report includes a description of the crime according 
to case files, the offender’s criminal history according to a 
records check, and interviews with the offender and his or her 
associates. In theory, then, the judge could form an opinion 
about the case that is independent of the rendition 
communicated by the prosecution and defense. However, others 
have reported that judges are typically deferential 
(Commission, 2011; Commission, 2012)***. we might expect 
federal judges to partially rectify the injustice by 
being more lenient with black offenders than with white 
offenders, conditional on the guideline cell. That relative 
leniency is the opposite of what we find. Rather, if federal 
prosecutors discriminate against blacks, federal judges appear 
to reinforce discrimination by disparate sentences. It is 
possible that federal prosecutors discriminate in favor of 
black offenders and we are simply estimating corrective action 
by federal judges (although we cannot prove otherwise, this 
explanation seems unlikely and we do not pursue it).

Figure 2 shows trends toward increasing disparity. If 
prosecutorial behavior explained those trends, we would expect 
to see coincident trends in prosecutorial behavior. Evidence 
reported in the following subsections suggests otherwise.

**********************************
5.3.1 Facts surrounding the case
**********************************

Table 3 shows summary statistics reflecting changes in 
prosecutorial behavior. It is possible that prosecutors have 
increasingly manipulated offenders’ criminal history scores. If 
so, we should be able to observe changes over time, and we are 
especially interested in determining whether blacks are 
increasingly advantaged or disadvantaged, as this may explain 
what we are observing about trends in sentencing disparity. 
Table 3 shows seven indicators of prosecutorial behavior. We 
are interested in whether those indicators change materially 
over time.

Evidence shows that blacks have higher criminal history scores 
than do whites, but we do not observe a strong difference in 
the trends for whites and blacks (table 3). Blacks tend to have 
higher offense level scores. We see some narrowing in the 
difference in the scores for whites and blacks, but overall we 
do not see large trends in the offense severity score and 
certainly no trends that disadvantage blacks.

The original commission considered acceptance-of-responsibility 
adjustments as a substitute for plea bargaining. As table 3 
shows, blacks receive slightly smaller acceptance-of-
responsibility adjustments. (The numbers reflect the average 
number of reductions in the offense level, so the more negative 
the reduction, the greater the benefit to the offender.) There 
has been a modest increase in the size of acceptance-of-
responsibility adjustments, but the increase has not been large 
and both whites and blacks have benefited to the same degree.

Prosecutors exercise choice over petitioning the court for 
substantial assistance departures. As shown in table 3, blacks 
and whites receive substantial assistance departures at about 
the same rate. Over time, the rate has been constant for blacks 
and has decreased for whites. However, these changes have not 
been large. Prosecutors also exercise choice over petitioning 
the court for other downward departures. We see modest trends 
in other government-sponsored departures, and blacks and whites 
receive other government-sponsored departures at about the same 
rates. Data for government-sponsored departures below the 
guideline range are only available for cases sentenced since 
the Booker v. United States decision. Therefore, no data appear 
for 2003 and 2004. Continuing this logic, table 3 also shows 
the proportion of cases involving the imposition of a mandatory 
minimum, regardless of the offense associated with the minimum 
(i.e., for a drug offense or a weapons offense).***Footnote 39 
We used the USSC variables MAND1 to MAND6 to determine whether 
any mandatory minimum sentence was imposed in the case. These 
variables are only available since 2005***. It shows that 
blacks are more likely to receive mandatory minimums, and it 
apparently shows random fluctuations. Overall, the proportion 
of cases where a mandatory minimum was imposed has not changed 
significantly over time for either blacks or whites.

Few offenders demand a trial, but blacks may be more likely to 
demand trials if they are disadvantaged by plea agreements. 
Blacks are convicted at trial rather than by plea more 
frequently than are whites, but the differences are not large 
(because trials are infrequent) and there is no evidence that 
the decreasing frequency of trials is disadvantaging black 
offenders.

The evidence does not show that prosecutorial behavior changed 
from 2003 through 2012. The relative constancy of prosecutorial 
practices cannot explain the trends reported in figure 2.

**********************************
5.3.2 Gaming drug amounts near 
mandatory minimums
**********************************

The evidence presented in the previous subsection pertained to 
trends in indicators of prosecutorial discretion. In this 
subsection, we examine charging decisions with respect to drug 
amounts. This is not based on trend analysis, but it is 
nevertheless informative about prosecutorial decision-making.

Drug offenses provide one venue for finding evidence of whether 
prosecutors have exercised discretion to the disadvantage of 
blacks. Mandatory minimums for drug violators are triggered by 
the amount of drugs that were trafficked. For example, when an 
offender is convicted of trafficking 500 or more grams of 
cocaine, he or she is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence, 
absent some mitigating considerations. If there were evidence 
of discretion favoring one group over others around a statutory
mandatory minimum, we would expect to observe larger 
percentages of favored groups having drug amounts just shy of 
the minimum, compared to the other groups. Our analysis 
suggests that this is not happening.

We look for evidence of prosecutorial manipulation in recorded 
drug weights for drug trafficking cases. Specifically, we look 
to see whether blacks are more likely than whites to be above a 
mandatory minimum threshold for drug cases, with amounts near a 
threshold that triggers the application of mandatory minimum 
sentencing laws. If blacks are systematically disadvantaged, 
then blacks should be more likely than whites to be above a 
mandatory minimum threshold. We limit this investigation to the 
six major drugs that make up the overwhelming majority of 
sentenced cases: cocaine, crack, heroin, marijuana, mixture 
methamphetamine, and pure methamphetamine.

Figure 8 provides an example based on powder cocaine. We have 
included Hispanics in the figure, so the categories are non-
Hispanic whites (white), non-Hispanic blacks or African 
Americans (black), and Hispanics. This figure shows three 
distributions of drug amounts for offenders in a broadly 
defined range (+/- 100 grams) around the lower mandatory 
minimum threshold amount for cocaine (500 grams). For this 
figure, offenders have been grouped into discrete bins spanning 
approximately 10 grams (i.e., 480 to 489.99, 490 to 499.99, 500 
to 509.99). The horizontal axis shows the grams of cocaine 
associated with the offense, and the vertical axis shows the 
percentages of offenders within each grouping that fall into 
each bin. The bins themselves have been mapped to a smoothed 
line to aid in visualization.

Figure 8 – Distribution of offenders within 100 grams of the 
500-gram mandatory minimum threshold, by race and ethnicity

Five hundred grams of cocaine is one-half kilogram, and perhaps 
this is a standard unit of transaction, explaining the 
concentration around 500 grams. A more likely explanation is 
that prosecutors are most interested in establishing that 
offenders have transacted at least 500 grams, which triggers a 
mandatory minimum, and that prosecutors have little incentive 
to demonstrate that offenders have transacted somewhat more 
than this amount until the transaction reaches about 5 
kilograms, which triggers the next application of a mandatory 
minimum.

This figure depicts a divergence between the three racial or 
ethnic groups on the interval between 480 and 500 grams and 
suggests that, relative to whites, blacks and Hispanics are 
more likely to fall just below the 500-gram cutoff. The 
differences are not large, however, implying that during the 
post-Booker period, prosecutors have not discriminated against 
blacks when establishing that a case meets the mandatory 
minimum threshold.

To formally test for differences by race, we estimate a linear 
regression that models the probability of falling above a 
threshold amount, controlling for offender criminal history, 
education, sex, substantial assistance to the prosecution, 
sentencing year, whether the case went to trial, and circuit 
fixed effects. We estimate separate models for each drug and 
each mandatory minimum threshold amount. In addition, the 
sample is restricted to cases where the safety valve provision 
was not applied. Based on drug statute 21 U.S.C. § 841, we 
identify two thresholds for each drug--low and high--defined in 
table D1 in appendix D. Overall, we do not find strong evidence 
to support the argument that blacks face systematic 
prosecutorial discrimination. Rather, racial inequities around 
minimum thresholds appear more idiosyncratic or drug-specific. 

Table 4 shows the result of our estimation.

This table shows the estimated difference in the probability of 
being just above a threshold amount by race, drug, and 
threshold. For cocaine, it shows that blacks have a probability 
that is 0.10 lower than whites to be above the 500-gram 
threshold, but not statistically more or less likely to be 
above the 5,000-gram threshold (i.e., the next step in the 
mandatory minimum gradient). Hispanics are also less likely 
than whites to be above either the 500- or 5,000-gram 
threshold. For crack, heroin, and methamphetamine, no strong 
differences emerge. For marijuana, blacks are more likely to be 
above the lower (1,000 kilogram) threshold, with no detectable 
differences for Hispanics. Based on these results, there is no 
obvious pattern of preference that favors or disadvantages 
blacks.

In addition to the results presented here, there are other 
aspects of the data that warrant further discussion and from 
which we conduct additional sensitivity analysis. The first is 
that drug amounts are not always recorded as exact weights or 
amounts in the sentencing data. Instead, amounts are often 
recorded as ranges. We find that this occurs roughly 25% of the 
time for drug trafficking cases overall, although this 
percentage varies depending on the drug type. Table D2 in 
appendix D shows the percentage of cases in which no exact drug 
amount is reported, stratified by drug type and race category. 
Given the sizeable number of such cases, we would not want to 
exclude them from analysis. However, because the reported 
ranges themselves are relatively wide, we cannot identify 
offenders as being close to the thresholds. Our solution is to 
analyze these cases as a separate group.

For this group, we find that reported ranges generally (1) do 
not overlap thresholds and (2) often use threshold amounts as 
range boundaries. Given this, we select and analyze offenders 
with recorded ranges bounded by an amount that is also a 
threshold cutoff (e.g., as in a range of cocaine amount [from > 
0 to 500 grams or from 500 to 1,500 grams]) and test whether 
black offenders are more likely to be strictly at or above the 
threshold, relative to whites. The specification for this test 
is identical to the estimation performed using the exact 
weights discussed earlier (i.e., estimating a linear 
probability model using covariates, such as criminal history, 
sex, race and circuit, and separate models for each drug). 
Table D3 in appendix D reports the results of these 
estimations. This table shows estimates that are largely 
consistent with our earlier findings. And while there are some 
differences from our earlier results, some of these differences 
may simply be due to chance. We find no discernable evidence of 
systematic bias in prosecutorial practice.

********************
6.0 Conclusions
********************

At least since Marvin Frankel’s 1973 book, Criminal Sentences; 
Law without Order, was published, sentencing disparity has been 
a concern of federal justice administration. That concern led 
Congress to pass the Comprehensive Crime Control Act in 1984, 
which created the USSC. The duly appointed commission crafted 
the first Federal Sentencing Guidelines in 1987. For decades, 
scholars have debated whether the guidelines have reduced 
disparity; with the Booker decision, which rendered the 
guidelines advisory, scholars have argued whether disparity has 
subsequently increased or decreased, and they have debated 
whether a return to some form of mandatory guidelines would 
benefit or harm justice administration.

Our study does not attempt to answer the question of whether 
the guidelines increased or decreased disparity, whether the 
Booker decision increased or decreased disparity, and whether a 
new mandatory guideline system that passed Supreme Court 
scrutiny would improve justice administration. Commissioned by 
BJS, our study has proposed a way of studying sentencing 
disparity that helps answer questions about the level of 
disparity and post-Booker trends. The methodology could be 
extended to study the causal effects of Booker, although the 
grounds for making causal statements in a non-experimental 
setting are treacherous.

Like earlier studies, our study treats the guideline cell as 
the anchor point for any further analysis of sentencing 
patterns. Using data transformations that standardize sentences 
within each guideline cell, we have introduced a regression-
based methodology that allows us to make summary statements 
about how racial disparity varies across guideline cells and 
over time. By using a linear random effects regression model, 
we are able to make summary statements about how racial 
disparity varies across judges. We do not claim this is the 
only valid methodology for studying disparity, and for some 
research questions it may not even be the best; however, for 
the questions posed by BJS, this methodology has strong appeal.

The methodology is solidly within the tradition of studying 
disparity, given the facts known at the time of sentencing, but 
some researchers claim that locating a study of disparity this 
late in the judicial process ignores disparity in prosecutorial 
decision-making. While we do not necessarily find this 
counterargument compelling, we have dealt with the critique 
indirectly by showing that prosecutorial discretion does not 
appear to have changed much since 2005 (the beginning of our 
study), although we find trends toward increased racial 
disparity between 2005 and 2012. These trends are likely 
attributable to judicial behavior, not prosecutorial behavior. 
This conclusion is strengthened by evidence from the estimated 
random effects of considerable inter-judge differences in the 
sentences for white and black offenders.

What we find is that black males receive harsher sentences than 
white males after accounting for the facts surrounding the 
case, and we also find that the sentencing disparity has grown 
over the 8 years since Booker. We find that females receive 
sentences that are less harsh than their male counterparts, but 
curiously we find that black and white females receive similar 
sentences. Something other than skin color and racial prejudice 
per se is driving these results.

We find it difficult to attribute racial disparity to skin 
color alone. While it is an obvious distinction, in the United 
States race is bundled with a large number of unobserved 
characteristics. We have observed that blacks are more 
concentrated within circuits that impose harsh sentences 
compared with more lenient circuits. It is possible that blacks 
receive the same sentences as whites within every circuit, but 
that blacks receive harsher sentences than whites nationally. 
After we account for these circuit differences, racial 
disparity remains, but the point is that race is correlated 
with other characteristics that may account for different 
sentences among whites and blacks. For example, we know that 
blacks sentenced in the federal justice system are, on average, 
less educated than are whites sentenced in the federal justice 
system. Therefore, if judges take education into account (along 
with correlates such as earnings and demeanor), then racial 
disparity could be explained by factors that might be deemed to 
be reasonable desiderata when imposing sentences. A study of 
disparity is not a study of bias. Our study cannot get at the 
ultimate reasons why black males receive harsher sentences than 
do white males, after accounting for the facts surrounding the 
case.

We are concerned that racial disparity has increased over time 
since Booker. Perhaps judges, who feel increasingly emancipated 
from their guidelines restrictions, are improving justice 
administration by incorporating relevant but previously ignored 
factors into their sentencing calculus, even if this 
improvement disadvantages black males as a class. But in a 
society that sees intentional and unintentional racial bias in 
many areas of social and economic activity, these trends are a 
warning sign. It is further distressing that judges disagree 
about the relative sentences for white and black males because 
those disagreements cannot be so easily explained by 
sentencing-relevant factors that vary systematically between 
black and white males. (The judge-specific effects take random 
variation into account.) We take the random effect as strong 
evidence of disparity in the imposition of sentences for white 
and black males.

****************************************
Appendix A: Mechanics of guidelines
****************************************

The United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual 
(2013) provides instructions for applying the guidelines. 
These instructions are detailed, and interested readers should 
consult them in the original. Our current intention is to 
provide an overview.

The guidelines stipulate a sentencing table that has 43 rows 
and 6 columns defining 258 cells. The applicable row is 
determined by the offense seriousness and the applicable column 
is determined by the offender’s criminal history. Calculations 
required to identify the row and column are described below. 
The cells are clustered into four zones. A probation term is 
authorized in zones A and B, but a probation term in zone B 
must be accompanied by an alternative to confinement, such as 
home detention. A prison term is required in zones C and D.

The sentencing table cell specifies the length of the prison 
term. For example, an offense level of 16 and a criminal 
history category of IV require a prison term between 33 and 41 
months. Even when the guidelines were mandatory, a judge could 
depart upward or downward from the stipulated range. Now that 
the guidelines are advisory, there is no obligation to adhere 
to the range. We discuss departure reasons later in this 
appendix; first we review how the guidelines establish the 
offense level.

*****************
Offense level
*****************

Determination of offense level begins with the basic offense. 
For example, chapter 2 in the guidelines defines an aggravated 
assault. A judge who is sentencing an offender convicted of an 
aggravated assault starts with a baseline offense level of 14 
and considers other aspects of the case. Instructions are--

* If the crime involved more than minimal planning, add 2 
points, increasing the offense level from 14 to 16.

* Add 3 to 5 points depending on the nature of the weapon 
(if any) and how it was used.

* Add 3 to 10 points depending on the extent of injury.

* Add 2 points if the crime was motivated by profit.

* Add 2 points if certain statutory provisions are met.

The guidelines provide detailed instructions and definitions.

Other offenses have different baseline offense levels and 
recognize case elements that distinguish cases based on 
severity within an offense type. Points for property crimes are 
determined by the dollar loss. Points for drug crimes are 
determined by the type and amount of drugs bought or sold. 
Offense categories sometimes overlap, and the guidelines 
provide cross-references to resolve ambiguities.

Some elements of criminal cases are common to multiple types of 
cases. These elements are identified in chapter 3, where they 
are called adjustments, and consist of five categories:

*  Victim adjustments (e.g., an enhancement for a vulnerable 
victim, as defined by the guidelines).

*  The offender’s role in the offense (e.g., points are added 
if the offender leads a criminal enterprise, and points are 
subtracted if the offender was a minimal participant).

*  Points are added if the offender obstructed or impeded the 
administration of justice.

*  Offenders are often convicted of multiple counts for the 
same type of offense or for different offenses. The guidelines 
provide rules for imposing a sentence given multiple counts of 
conviction.

*  The guidelines apply what they call “acceptance of 
responsibility provisions.” If the offender clearly 
demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his or her 
offense, the offense level is decreased by 2 levels. Under some 
conditions, on motion of the government stating that the 
offender has assisted authorities in the investigation or 
prosecution of his or her misconduct by timely notifying 
authorities of an intention to enter a guilty plea, the offense 
level is decreased by 1 additional level.

Criminal history category
******************************

Chapter 4 provides rules for determining the criminal history 
category. This chapter applies points to the offender’s 
criminal record, taking into account prior sentences and 
whether the instant crime was done while the offender was under 
community supervision. The criminal history score makes special 
provisions for career criminals and criminal livelihoods.

Departures
*************

Using the offense level from chapter 3 and the criminal history 
category from chapter 4, calculations identify the guideline 
cell. The guidelines sometimes use the term heartland to mean 
the guidelines capture most of the elements of the offense and 
offender. As a result, most sentences should be imposed 
consistent with the guideline cell. The guidelines prohibit 
departures under some conditions and allow departures for 
others. In fact, because the guidelines are now voluntary, 
there is great latitude for departures. Some latitude for 
departures is built into the guidelines, and its presence needs 
to be recognized by the study of disparity--a point made below.

Mandatory minimum sentences
****************************

Federal criminal codes specify maximum sentences for all 
crimes. For example, a code might specify that an offender can 
serve 0 to 5 years if convicted for a count of larceny. There 
is no minimum prison term. Other federal criminal codes--
especially for drug violations--specify both a minimum and a 
maximum. For example, if someone is convicted of distributing X 
grams of cocaine, the code may specify that the sentence is 
between 2 and 5 years. The guidelines might then require a 
sentence between 2 and 2½ years. The minimum sentence sets a 
lower limit on the guidelines and on any legitimate sentence.
However, federal law (18 U.S.C. 3553(f)(1)-(5)) allows the 
court to sentence below the mandatory minimum when the 
following hold:

*  The offender has no more than 1 criminal history point.

*  He or she did not use violence or credible threats.

*  There was neither death nor serious bodily injury.

*  The offender was neither an organizer, leader, manager, or 
supervisor of a criminal enterprise.

*  The offender revealed all known information about the crime.
Provided the minimum sentence is 5 years or more, the minimum 
guidelines range may be reduced, but no lower than level 17.

Substantial assistance
************************

The sentencing judge is able to depart downward on a motion by 
the government that the offender “…has provided substantial 
assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another 
person who has committed an offense…” Commentary in the 
guidelines instructs: “Substantial weight should be given to 
the government’s evaluation of the extent of the defendant’s 
assistance, particularly where the extent and value of the 
assistance are difficult to ascertain.” Government-initiated 
downward departures are frequent.

Warranted departures
*********************

While the guidelines are intended to cover most circumstances, 
the Commission indicates that the sentencing judge may confront 
situations where the circumstances faced by the court are so 
unusual that applying the guidelines would be an injustice. In 
those cases, the sentencing judge can depart from the 
guidelines provided he or she provides an explanation. The 
guidelines also provide policy statements identifying special 
circumstances when a departure would apply. For example, if a 
victim or victims suffered psychological injury much more 
serious than that normally resulting from commission of the 
offense, the court may increase the sentence above the 
authorized guidelines range. In addition, the guidelines offer 
numerous examples of when a departure would be appropriate.

Prohibited departures
************************

The guidelines identify factors that cannot be taken into 
account when departing from the guidelines range. A judge 
cannot base a sentence on race, sex, national origin, religion, 
and reconsider the weighting of factors, such as acceptance of 
responsibility and role in the offense, that are already 
incorporated into the guidelines.

Characteristics of the offender
*********************************

Chapter 5, part H, discusses some specific characteristics of 
offenders that may not be taken into account at the time of 
sentencing. Referring to the Sentencing Reform Act, according 
to the guidelines manual:

First, the act directs the Commission to ensure that the 
guidelines and policy statements "are entirely neutral" as to 
five characteristics—race, sex, national origin, creed, and 
socioeconomic status. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(d).

Second, the act directs the Commission to consider whether 11 
specific offender characteristics, "among others," have any 
relevance to the nature, extent, place of service, or other 
aspects of an appropriate sentence, and to take them into 
account in the guidelines and policy statements, only to the 
extent that they do have relevance. See 28 U.S.C. § 994(d).

Third, the act directs the Commission to ensure that the 
guidelines and policy statements, in recommending a term of 
imprisonment or length of a term of imprisonment, reflect the 
"general inappropriateness" of considering five of those 
characteristics—education, vocational skills, employment 
record, family ties and responsibilities, and community ties. 
See 28 U.S.C. § 994(e).

Fourth, the act also directs the sentencing court, in 
determining the particular sentence to be imposed, to consider, 
among other factors, "the history and characteristics of the 
defendant." See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(1).

According to the Commission:
*****************************

The Supreme Court has emphasized that the advisory guideline 
system should "continue to move sentencing in Congress’ 
preferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing 
disparities while maintaining flexibility sufficient to 
individualize sentences where necessary. See United States v. 
Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 264-65 (2005). Although the court must 
consider "the history and characteristics of the defendant" 
among other factors, see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), in order to avoid 
unwarranted sentencing disparities the court should not give 
them excessive weight. Generally, the most appropriate use of 
specific offender characteristics is to consider them not as a 
reason for a sentence outside the applicable guideline range 
but for other reasons, such as in determining the sentence 
within the applicable guideline range, the type of sentence 
(e.g., probation or imprisonment) within the sentencing options 
available for the applicable Zone on the Sentencing Table, and 
various other aspects of an appropriate sentence. To avoid 
unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with 
similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct, 
see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6), 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B), the 
guideline range, which reflects the defendant’s criminal 
conduct and the defendant’s criminal history, should continue 
to be "the starting point and the initial benchmark." Gall v. 
United States, 552 U.S. 38, 49 (2007).

Accordingly, the purpose of this part is to provide sentencing 
courts with a framework for addressing specific offender 
characteristics in a reasonably consistent manner. Using such a 
framework in a uniform manner will help "secure nationwide 
consistency" (see Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 49 
(2007)), "avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities" (see 28 
U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B), 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6)), "provide 
certainty and fairness" (see 28 U.S.C. § 991(b)(1)(B)), and 
"promote respect for the law" (see 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(A)).

The Commission identified several offender characteristics 
regarding which sentencing judges may have dissenting views. 
The Commission deemed that age may be relevant but considered 
the situation where the frail may not require prison. Education 
and vocational skills are considered irrelevant, unless they 
are pertinent to the crime. Mental and emotional conditions may 
be relevant but only in extreme circumstances. Similar to age, 
physical condition may be relevant. Drug and alcohol dependence 
is ordinarily not a reason for a departure, unless it 
accomplishes a specific treatment purpose. Employment is 
ordinarily irrelevant. Family ties and responsibilities are not 
ordinarily relevant, although the Commission makes exceptions 
for loss of caretaking and financial support.
