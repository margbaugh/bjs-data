Mortality in Local Jails and State Prisons, 2000-2011 - 
Statistical Tables

Margaret E. Noonan, BJS Statistician

In 2011, 4,238 inmates died while in the custody of local 
jails or state prisons, an increase of 2% or 88 deaths from 
2010. A total of 885 deaths (21%) occurred in local jails. 
Overall, jails reported 33 fewer deaths in 2011 than in 
2010. Heart disease and suicide continued to be the two 
leading causes of death in local jails, accounting for more 
than half (61%) of all jail deaths in 2011. The mortality 
rate in jails (122 deaths per 100,000 inmates) declined 2% 
from 2010 to 2011, continuing a general decline in mortality 
rates that was first observed in 2008. Heart disease and 
suicide mortality rates remained relatively stable between 
2010 and 2011.

Over the 12-year period between 2000 and 2011, suicide 
accounted for an annual average of 41 deaths per 100,000 
jail inmates, while heart disease accounted for 31 deaths 
per 100,000. To account for single-year fluctuations that 
are common in mortality data, 3-year moving averages were 
calculated for selected causes of death in jails and 
prisons. Figures display the most recent year for trend 
estimates based on 3-year moving averages centered on the 
middle year. For example, estimates reported for 2010 
represent the average estimates from 2009 through 2011. The 
3-year moving average for heart disease remained relatively 
stable, varying between 27 and 34 deaths per 100,000 jail 
inmates (figure 1). For suicide, the rate varied between 34 
and 48 deaths per 100,000 inmates. (See Methodology for more 
information on moving averages.)

The majority of jails (81%) reported zero deaths in 2011, 
which was consistent with an annual average of 82% of jails 
reporting zero deaths between 2000 and 2011. Approximately 
13% of jails reported a single death, and 6% of jails 
reported two or more deaths in 2011.

In 2011, deaths in prisons (3,353 deaths) accounted for 
approximately 80% of all deaths in local jails and state 
prisons. Deaths in state prisons increased by 121 from 2010 
to 2011, which accounted for the overall net increase of 
inmate deaths in local jails and state prisons. Cancer and 
heart disease were the two leading causes of death in state 
prisons in 2011, accounting for more than half (56%) of 
deaths in state prisons.

Mortality rates in state prisons have been nearly stable 
since 2001. The mortality rate for both cancer and heart 
disease was 65 deaths per 100,000 prisoners between 2001 and 
2011. Among prisoners, the 3-year moving average mortality 
rate for heart disease remained relatively constant from 
2002 to 2010, while the 3-year moving average mortality rate 
for cancer began to increase in 2008 (figure 2).

The data in this report were developed from the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics’ (BJS) Deaths in Custody Reporting 
Program (DCRP), an annual data collection about inmate 
deaths in local jails and state prisons. The program began 
collecting data from jails in 2000 and from prisons in 2001. 
This report covers deaths in custody occurring in local 
jails and state prisons between 2000 and 2011. Statistical 
tables provide information about the causes and 
circumstances of local jail and state prison inmate deaths 
and present trends by cause of death, selected decedent 
characteristics, and mortality rates for jails and prisons 
inmates by states.

**************************
Mortality in local jails
**************************

Cause of death
***************

* The number of deaths in local jails decreased from 918 
deaths in 2010 to 885 deaths in 2011 (table 1).

* Heart disease accounted for about a quarter (26%) of 
deaths in local jails in 2011 (table 2).

* After an initial decline in 2008, the mortality rate for 
jail inmates has remained relatively unchanged (125 deaths 
per 100,000 inmates in 2010 and 122 per 100,000 in 2011). 
Likewise, the mortality rate showed little variation from 
2000 to 2007, increasing or decreasing between 1% and 3% 
(table 3). 

* The illness-related mortality rate decreased approximately 
10% between 2010 and 2011, driven by a 50% decrease in the 
AIDS-related mortality rate.

* The suicide rate in local jails declined over time, from 
49 suicide deaths per 100,000 inmates in 2001 to 36 per 
100,000 in 2007. Excluding 2008 data, the rate increased 18% 
from 2007 to reach 43 suicides per 100,000 inmates in 2011. 
(See Methodology for more information about 2008 data.)


Decedent characteristics
*************************

* Males accounted for nearly 9 in 10 (87%) deaths in local 
jails in 2011. Whites accounted for more than half (59%) of 
local jail deaths in the same year (table 5).

* Males and females died at nearly equal rates in local 
jails in 2011 (table 6).

* The mortality rate for black inmates (89 per 100,000) in 
2011 was the lowest observed mortality rate among black 
inmates since the DCRP began collecting data in 2000.

* Consistently each year since 2000, the jail mortality rate 
increased with inmates’ age. In 2011, jail inmates age 55 
and older died at a rate (650 deaths per 100,000) that was 
about three times the rate for younger inmates.

* In 2011, more than a third (39%) of deaths occurred within 
the first week of admission to the jail facility.

* Between 2000 and 2011, about half of suicides (48%) and a 
third (32%) of heart disease deaths occurred within the 
first week of admission. More than a fifth of AIDS-related 
deaths (22%) and more than a third of cancer deaths (38%) 
occurred after 6 months of admission (table 7).

* Between 2000 and 2011, male jail inmates were 1.6 times 
more likely to commit suicide than female inmates. Female 
jail inmates were nearly twice as likely as males to die of 
drug or alcohol intoxication (table 8).

Facility characteristics
*************************

* In 2011, 8 in 10 jails (81%) reported zero deaths to the 
DCRP. From 2000 to 2011, an annual average of 82% of jails 
reported zero deaths (table 9).

* About 20% of all jails reported one or more deaths in 
2011. Among these jails, 67% reported a single death. 

* Together, California, Florida, New York, and Texas 
reported about a third of jail deaths in 2011. These states 
also had the largest jail populations, comprising 31% of the 
total jail population (table 10).

* About half of all jail jurisdictions in California, 
Maryland, New Jersey, and West Virginia reported at least 
one death in 2011 (table 13).

Moving averages
****************

* The heart disease mortality rate was generally higher in 
the years prior to 2005 (appendix table 2).

* Among white inmates, the mortality rate for heart disease 
was at least 40 deaths per 100,000 prior to 2007. After a 
period of decline, the rate increased from 37 to 45 deaths 
per 100,000 white inmates between 2010 and 2011.

* Overall, the mortality rate for heart disease among 
inmates age 55 or older declined from 2003 to 2008, then 
increased after 2009. The rate in 2010 (279 per 100,000) was 
still lower than rates observed prior to 2006.

* The suicide rate increased in 2009 and 2010, after small 
declines between 2002 and 2008 (appendix table 4). 

* Between 2006 and 2008, male jail inmates committed suicide 
at a rate that was about twice that of female jail inmates, 
while the suicide rates for male and female jail inmates 
were more similar in 2010.

* From 2000 to 2010, the suicide rate for white inmates was 
at least 3 times higher than the rate for inmates of other 
races or Hispanic origin.

***************************
Mortality in state prisons
***************************

Cause of death
***************

* The number of inmates who died in the custody of state 
prisons increased 4%, from 3,232 deaths in 2010 to 3,353 in 
2011 (table 14).

* In 2011, cancer was the most common cause of death in 
prisons, followed by heart disease, liver disease, 
respiratory disease, and AIDS-related deaths. As with 
previous years, cancer and heart disease accounted for more 
than half (56%) of all prison deaths in 2011 (table 15).

* The illness-related mortality rate among state prisoners 
increased 4% in 2011. This increase was driven by the cancer 
mortality rate, which increased 11% between 2010 (70 per 
100,000) and 2011 (78 per 100,000) (table 16).

* In 2011, the cancer mortality rate in state prisons (78 
per 100,000) exceeded the heart disease mortality rate (65 
per 100,000) for the fourth consecutive year.

* The AIDS-related mortality rate among state prisoners 
declined 22% from 2010 to 2011 and has declined 81% since 
2001.

Decedent characteristics
*************************

* In 2011, male prisoners accounted for more than 96% of 
prison deaths. The number of female inmates dying in state 
prisons has been relatively stable at an annual average of 
133 deaths each year between 2001 and 2011 (table 17).

* White prisoners accounted for about half of prison inmate 
deaths in any single year between 2001 and 2010, and for 57% 
of deaths in 2011. Black inmates accounted for about a third 
of prisoner deaths in any single year between 2001 and 2011, 
and for 31% of deaths in 2011 (table 18).

* Between 2001 and 2011, the female prisoner mortality rate 
fluctuated from 127 to 172 deaths per 100,000 female 
prisoners.  In 2011, the male prisoner mortality rate was 
1.6 times higher than the female prisoner mortality rate 
(table 20).

Cause of death by decedent characteristics
*******************************************

* Mortality rates for cancer, heart disease, liver disease, 
and accidents were about twice the rates for male prisoners 
than for female prisoners (table 22).

* Between 2001 and 2011, black state prisoners (8 per 
100,000) committed suicide at about a third of the rate of 
white state prisoners (25 per 100,000).

* Among both natural and unnatural deaths, the age of 
inmates was strongly associated with high mortality rates:

* Prisoners age 55 and older died of cancer, heart disease, 
and respiratory disease at rates that were at least 5 times 
higher than for any other age group.


* The homicide rate among prisoners age 55 or older was 2 to 
3 times higher than for prisoners ages 18 to 44. The 
accident-related mortality rate for prisoners age 55 or 
older was at least 2.5 times higher than for younger 
inmates.

Deaths by jurisdiction
***********************

* Between 2010 and 2011, more than a third (20 of 50) of 
state departments of correction reported a decrease in the 
number of deaths in state prisons (table 23).

* The mortality rate among federal prisoners decreased 2%, 
from 224 deaths per 100,000 federal prisoners in 2010 to 220 
deaths per 100,000 in 2011 (table 24).

Cause of death by state 
************************

* The average annual mortality rate for state prisoners 
between 2001 and 2011 varied by state from 152 deaths per 
100,000 inmates in 2001 to 450 deaths per 100,000 inmates in 
2011, with a median rate of 243 deaths per 100,000 inmates 
(table 26).

* Mortality rates by cause of death may  not be directly 
comparable between states due to differences in age, sex, 
race, geographic location, or any other characteristic of 
the correctional popluation.

Moving averages
****************

* The cancer mortality rate increased for both male (up 22%) 
and female (up 79%) prisoners from 2002 to 2010. The cancer 
mortality rate for female prisoners showed the greatest 
increase, from 26 deaths per 100,000 in 2002 to 47 deaths 
per 100,000 in 2010 (appendix table 6).

* The cancer mortality rate for white and black prisoners 
steadily increased from 2002 to 2010. The rate for white 
prisoners increased 33%, and the rate for black prisoners 
increased 24% during the period. 

* The liver disease mortality rate for state prisoners 
remained nearly unchanged from 2002 to 2010 (appendix table 
8).

* From 2001 to 2011, black prisoners had the lowest liver 
disease mortality rate (between 13 and 15 deaths per 100,000 
inmates). 

* Suicide rates among state prisoners were relatively stable 
from 2002 to 2010. White inmates committed suicide at a 
higher rate than prisoners of other races or Hispanic 
origin. The suicide rate for white inmates was at least 1.3 
times higher than the rate of Hispanic inmates and 3 times 
higher than the suicide rate of black inmates (appendix 
table 11).

Methodology

Data collection coverage
*************************

The Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP) is an annual 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) data collection. The DCRP 
collects national, state, and incident-level data on persons 
who died while in the physical custody of the 50 state 
departments of corrections or the approximately 2,800 local 
adult jail jurisdictions nationwide. The DCRP began in 2000 
under the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-
297), and it is the only national statistical collection to 
obtain comprehensive information about deaths in adult 
correctional facilities. BJS uses DCRP data to track 
national trends in the number and causes (or manners) of 
deaths occurring in state prison or local jail custody. 

Mortality data measured by the DCRP include decedent 
characteristics, such as sex, race and Hispanic origin, age, 
date of admission, conviction status, admission offense, and 
the location and type of facility (prison or jail) where the 
inmate died. The DCRP also collects data about circumstances 
surrounding the death, including the cause, time and 
location where the death occurred, and information on 
whether an autopsy was conducted and the availability of 
results to the respondent. In cases of deaths due to 
illness, the DCRP collects data on whether the decedent had 
a preexisting medical condition for which he or she received 
medical treatment prior to death. Data on executions are 
excluded from this report but are accessible on the BJS 
website along with the DCRP mortality data. Statistics 
presented in this report are current as of March 1, 2013. 
For more information on mortality in correctional settings, 
see Mortality in Local Jails, 2000–2007, NCJ 222988, BJS 
web, July 2010; Medical Causes of Death in State Prisons, 
2001–2004, NCJ 216340, BJS web, January 2007; and Suicide 
and Homicide in State Prisons and Local Jails, NCJ 210036, 
BJS web, August 2005.

The DCRP data collection instruments are administered 
annually to both state prisons and local jails. Respondents 
provide an aggregate count of the number of deaths that 
occurred during the referenced calendar year. State prison 
respondents provide aggregate counts through the National 
Prisoner Statistics data collection, and local jails provide 
aggregate counts through the Annual Survey of Jails. The 
jail (CJ-9) and prison (NPS-4A) survey instruments used to 
obtain data on each prison and jail death are available on 
the BJS website at www.bjs.gov. 

In addition to the death count, BJS requests jails to 
provide summary statistics about their population and 
admissions. All jails, including those with no deaths to 
report (which includes about 80% of jails in any given year) 
are asked to complete the annual summary survey form. BJS 
obtains a separate report describing the decedent’s 
characteristics and the circumstances surrounding the death 
for each death that occurred in a state prison or local 
jail. State prison and local jail respondents can submit 
individual records on decedents at any time during a 
collection cycle through a BJS web-based collection system.

BJS has modified the survey instruments slightly over time, 
including changes to clarify questions and ease the burden 
on respondents. Several questions were added to capture 
information on any medical treatment that the inmate 
received prior to death. Changes also allowed respondents to 
elaborate on cause of death by adding text boxes to the 
intoxication, suicide, and inmate-involved homicide death 
questions. Previously, these fields had only been available 
for deaths due to illness, accident, homicides not caused by 
other inmates, and other unspecified causes. In addition, 
BJS clarified respondent instructions on the prison forms 
and removed a question collecting the conviction status of 
an inmate after an analysis showed that more than 99% of 
prison inmates were convicted at the time of death. BJS also 
streamlined the survey layout to simplify the progression 
through questions related to autopsies. Rather than 
initially submitting an incomplete instrument that indicated 
pending autopsy results, respondents were only permitted to 
complete the entire survey after autopsy results were 
available. This change reduced follow-up contact and the 
burden on respondents.

Starting in 2001 and annually thereafter, BJS has collected 
DCRP data directly from state prison systems, maintaining a 
100% response rate.

Nonresponse
*************

The jail universe includes all jails currently operating and 
jails that have been contacted for the DCRP but have closed, 
consolidated, or otherwise eliminated operations. This 
universe allows BJS to determine jail participation in the 
DCRP. The most recent jail universe, constructed in 2013, 
identified 2,812 jurisdictions representing 3,247 jail 
facilities. Of these, 2,747 (97.6%) participated in the 
DCRP, a slight decrease from the 98% to 99% participation in 
previous years. 

The congressionally mandated Death in Custody Act expired at 
yearend 2006. Starting in 2007, participation in DCRP became 
voluntary. As a result, some jail juridictions no longer 
report data to the program. Change in deaths over time may 
be affected by this change in reporting.

A jail jurisdiction is a legal entity that has 
responsibility for managing jail facilities. Jail 
jurisdictions typically operate at the county level, in 
which a sheriff’s office or jail administrator manages the 
local facilities. The DCRP data identify the jail facility 
in which a jail inmate dies, but the data are arrayed at the 
jail jurisdiction level. BJS defines a jail as a locally 
operated correctional facility that confines persons before 
or after adjudication for more than 72 hours, excluding 
temporary lockups. Typically, there is one facility per jail 
jurisdiction, but the 2006 Census of Jail Facilities found 
that 15% of jail jurisdictions had multiple facilities under 
a central authority. (See the BJS website for more 
information.)

Determining eligibility for reporting to the DCRP
**************************************************

In the DCRP, custody refers to the holding of an inmate in a 
facility or to the period during which a correctional 
authority maintains a chain of custody over an inmate. For 
instance, if a jail transports an ill inmate to a hospital 
for medical services and that inmate dies while in the chain 
of custody of the jail, that death is counted as a death in 
custody. A death that occurs when an inmate is not in the 
custody of a correctional authority is considered beyond the 
scope of the DCRP. Out-of-scope deaths include inmates on 
escape status or under the supervision of community 
corrections on probation, parole, or home-electronic 
monitoring. BJS instructs both state prison and local jail 
officials to determine whether the inmate was in the 
physical custody of the jurisdiction at the time of death, 
regardless of the reason an inmate was being held. For state 
prisons responding to the survey, inmates in physical 
custody include those held in any private prison facility 
under contract to the responding state’s department of 
corrections or in any of their state-operated facilities, 
including halfway houses, prison camps or farms, training or 
treatment centers, and prison hospitals. 

BJS instructs state prison officials to exclude deaths of 
inmates who were transferred to local jails while still 
serving a prison term because the DCRP obtains information 
about such deaths through the jail reports. Jail inmate 
custody includes inmates who are temporarily out of the jail 
facility but are within the chain of custody of the jail. 
For example, a death in custody would include a jail inmate 
who died after being transferred to an offsite facility that 
cares for critically ill persons. Between 2000 and 2011, the 
DCRP data have shown that more than a third (41%) of jail 
inmate deaths occurred in medical facilities outside of the 
jail facility. 

Custody is further complicated by the dual law enforcement 
and jail administration functions of some sheriffs’ offices. 
As a result, some deaths reported as jail deaths actually 
occurred before the jail had custody of the decedent. BJS 
identifies and excludes from the DCRP these deaths that 
occurred in the process of arrest by using information about 
the circumstances surrounding the death. 

Cause-of-death information
***************************

The instructions for completing the DCRP tell respondents to 
report death information as determined by an autopsy or 
other official medical death investigation. For this 
collection, intoxication deaths, accidents, suicides, and 
homicides are considered discrete causes of death. Although 
there is a distinction between manner and cause of death 
from a medico-legal standpoint, no such distinction is made 
in the DCRP. When reporting a death due to illness, 
accident, suicide, intoxication, or homicide, BJS requests 
that respondents describe the events surrounding these 
deaths. 

Homicides include all types of intentional homicide and 
involuntary manslaughter as ruled by a medical examiner or 
pathologist at autopsy. For example, an inmate may die of 
positional asphyxia (suffocation caused by the position of 
the inmate’s body) while the inmate is being removed from a 
cell. A legal-intervention homicide committed while the 
inmate is trying to escape would also be included. In 
addition, homicides include cases that are ruled a homicide 
at autopsy when events that led to the death occurred prior 
to incarceration. For example, an inmate who was shot in the 
community years prior to incarceration died from 
complications of the gunshot wound while incarcerated.
 
Clinical data specialists convert illness-related death text 
entries into standard medical codes according to the World 
Health Organization’s International Statistical 
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 
Tenth Revision (ICD-10).
 
Other BJS sources of correctional mortality data
*************************************************

BJS collects other data reported to the DCRP on correctional 
mortality and deaths that occur in the process of arrest. 
These other collections include--

* Capital Punishment, which provides data on legal 
executions. Further discussion on executions is available on 
the BJS website.

* The National Prisoner Statistics (NPS), which annually 
collected aggregate counts of deaths in state and federal 
prisons prior to the establishment of the DCRP. Prior to 
2007, the NPS also collected counts of deaths by cause of 
death, including deaths due to execution, illness, AIDS, 
suicide, accident, homicide, and other causes. After 2006, 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons continued to submit the counts 
of deaths by cause of death using the DCRP, but no longer 
provided counts of deaths using the NPS. Further discussion 
of the NPS is available on the BJS website.

* The Census of Jails, conducted every 5 to 6 years, 
provides counts of inmate deaths in local jails. Further 
discussion of the Census of Jail Inmates is available on the 
BJS website.

* The Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC), which 
provides aggregate counts of the number of deaths occurring 
in all known Indian country correctional facilities operated 
by tribal authorities or the U.S. Department of the 
Interior’s Bureau of Indian Affairs. Further discussion of 
the SJIC is available on the BJS website.

* Arrest-Related Deaths (ARD), which obtains data on deaths 
that occurred during the process of arrest. State-level 
respondents provide details of deaths that occurred during 
arrest. Further discussion of ARD is available on the BJS 
website. 

Reported statistics 
********************

Mortality data are shown in statistical tables by type of 
correctional institution (state prisons and local jails) and 
include the number of deaths and mortality rates by year, 
cause of death, selected decedent characteristics, and 
state.

Mortality rates are calculated per 100,000 inmates, with the 
denominators providing estimates of the number of person-
years of exposure in custody in institutional corrections. 
Until 2010, the mortality rate for state prisons was 
calculated as the number of deaths per year divided by the 
midyear state prison population in custody multiplied by 
100,000. Starting in 2011, the rate was calculated using 
yearend custody counts because midyear populations were no 
longer available. Custody counts for state prisons provide 
estimates of person-years for prison populations. BJS uses 
data from the NPS to provide midyear and yearend custody 
counts of prisoners. For more information on the NPS, see 
the BJS website.

The mortality rate in local jails is calculated as the 
number of deaths per year divided by the average daily jail 
inmate population (ADP) multiplied by 100,000. The ADP for 
local jails is defined as the average daily number of jail 
inmates held in a jail jurisdiction during a calendar year, 
from January 1 through December 31. 

The ADP is used as the denominator for jail mortality rates 
to accommodate the high turnover and daily fluctuation in 
local jail populations. Also, the ADP better reflects the 
number of inmate days per year than a 1-day count. Jail 
populations have a higher turnover than prison populations; 
mean stay in local jails is about 21 days, compared to 2 
years for state prisons. 

The jail ADP also reflects the annual number of admissions 
and mean length of stay, and can be expressed as the product 
of these two values. When mean length of stay is expressed 
in years, the ADP is equivalent to the number of person-
years spent by jail inmates during a given year. BJS obtains 
the jail ADP data directly from jails through the DCRP using 
the summary form CJ-9A. Starting in 2002, BJS collected the 
ADP directly from respondents. Prior to 2002, BJS calculated 
the jail ADP by taking the average of the January 1 count 
from the prior year and the December 31 count from the 
reference year, which is an appropriate proxy measure for 
ADP.

Both denominators provide for annualizing mortality rates, 
which are calculated separately by group or by 
characteristic. The annualized mortality rates in state 
prisons and local jails are comparable to annual crude 
mortality rates reported by the National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS). 

The NCHS calculates crude mortality rates as the number of 
events for a period (e.g., a year) divided by the population 
estimate at the midpoint of the period. For general 
population mortality statistics, the NCHS employs the 
midyear population as an approximation to the average 
population exposed to risk of death during any given year. 
For more information, see Siegal, J. & Swanson, D. (2004). 
The Methods and Materials of Demography, Second Edition. San 
Diego, CA: Elsevier Academic Press, 269.

The crude mortality rates reported in the DCRP annual 
statistical tables are not directly comparable to the crude 
mortality rates within the (nonincarcerated) general 
population, and the crude mortality rates in state prisons 
are not directly comparable to those of local jails. The 
composition of the general population (sex, race, and age) 
differs from the population in state prisons and local 
jails. Because mortality is correlated with sex, race, and 
age, the crude mortality rates in state prisons, local 
jails, and the general population should not be compared. 

Individual inmate death records collected annually in the 
death file are included in the national death count. 
Independent jail-specific summary death counts are collected 
on the annual summary form (CJ-9A) and serve as control 
death totals. If the death count in the summary form file is 
greater than the count in the individual inmate death file, 
the summary file count is used as the total in calculating a 
jail mortality rate. For 2011, individual records for jail 
inmate deaths were adjusted to match independent counts of 
deaths occurring in each jail, and the mortality rates were 
adjusted accordingly.

Estimating inmate population Characteristics 
to calculate mortality rates by demographic 
subgroups
*********************************************

BJS does not obtain annual data for all demographic 
characteristics of prison and jail inmates in all 
jurisdictions. BJS uses data from sources other than the 
DCRP to estimate the nationwide sex, race, and age 
composition of state prison and local jail inmate 
populations. These data sources consist primarily of 
periodic surveys of inmates in custody in prisons and jails. 
The inmate characteristic distributions obtained from these 
surveys are applied to denominators (counts of inmates or 
ADP) to estimate the number of inmates in each demographic 
subgroup. 

BJS estimated the demographic distribution of the state 
prison population data from the NPS and National Corrections 
Reporting Program (NCRP) collections. For a discussion on 
the methodology for obtaining estimates of the sex, race, 
and age distributions of state prisoners, see Prisoners in 
2011, NCJ 239808, BJS web, December 2012.

Prior to using the NPS and NCRP to estimate demographic 
distributions, reports of mortality rates for state prison 
inmates used demographic distributions derived from BJS’s 
2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional 
Facilities (SISCF). As a result, state prison mortality 
rates shown in these tables may differ from previously 
published rates. A rate comparison between the two sources 
showed very little difference in the resultant mortality 
rates. In most instances, the rates either matched or nearly 
matched. The rates differed in only three instances: 
Hispanic in 2001, and females and inmates age 55 or older in 
2002. In each instance, the rates calculated using 
population data from the NCRP and NPS were slightly higher 
(less than a 1% increase) than rates calculated using 
population data from the SISCF.

To estimate the distributions of demographic attributes of 
the ADP for inmates, BJS used data from several surveys to 
generate distributions of sex, race, and age, and applied 
these distributions to the ADP. BJS’s Annual Survey of Jails 
(ASJ) provided estimates of the sex distribution of inmates 
for each year of the DCRP collection and applied these to 
each year’s ADP from the DCRP to estimate the ADP of male 
and female jail inmates. Jail Inmates at Midyear 2010 – 
Statistical Tables (NCJ 233431, BJS web, April 2011) 
documents that the distributions of inmate characteristics 
have changed slowly over time. For the most recent 
information on the ASJ, see the BJS website.

To estimate the racial and ethnic distribution of adult jail 
inmates, BJS used data from the Survey of Inmates in Local 
Jails (SILJ) and the National Inmate Survey (NIS) to 
estimate the relative distribution of adults by race and 
Hispanic origin for different periods. Because the SILJ 
(2002) and the NIS (2007 to 2009) are not fielded annually, 
the population estimates were smoothed before being applied 
to DCRP data. BJS used the SILJ estimates to cover the 
period from 2000 to 2004 and the NIS estimates to cover the 
period from 2005 to 2011. In both cases, the percentages 
associated with the distribution of race and Hispanic origin 
were applied to the adult jail ADP.

BJS did not annually collect data on the age distribution of 
jail populations. Rather, BJS obtained estimates of the age 
distribution of jail inmates from periodic surveys of jail 
inmates, including the SILJ in 2002 and the NIS from 2007 to 
2009, which are available on the BJS website. For more 
information about jail inmates in 2002, see Profile of Jail 
Inmates, 2002, NCJ 201932, BJS web, July 2004. 


To estimate the age distribution of the jail inmate 
population, BJS first obtained an estimate of the number of 
jail inmates age 17 or younger from the ASJ. According to 
table 6 in Jail Inmates at Midyear 2011 - Statistical Tables 
(NCJ 237961, BJS web, April 2012) from 2000 through 2011, 
the annual number of jail inmates age 17 or younger ranged 
from 5,900 to 7,600 inmates. By applying the annual 
percentage of jail inmates age 17 or younger to the annual 
average daily jail inmate population, BJS obtained an 
estimate of the ADP of jail inmates age 17 or younger. 

To estimate the age distribution of adult jail inmates, BJS 
used data from the SILJ for 2000 to 2006 and the NIS for 
2007 to 2011 to estimate the relative distribution of adults 
by age category for different periods. The age estimates 
were smoothed to account for gaps in reference years when 
age estimates were available, specifically for 2003, 2006, 
2010, and 2011.

Moving averages 
****************

Moving averages were used to smooth short term 
irregularities and to estimate long term trends. For 
instance, moving averages were computed to examine data 
trends for certain causes of death in jails and prisons 
while smoothing out short-term fluctuations. The data were 
cut into several 3-year overlapping periods spanning all 11 
years of prison data and 12 years of jail data.

The moving averages in this report describe some changes in 
cause-specific mortality rates over time (e.g., whether the 
decline in the AIDS-related mortality rate was steady, or 
whether the increase of suicides in jails was recent). 
Moving averages were not computed for all causes of death in 
custody, because the resultant rates would have been 
unstable and therefore statistically meaningless due to 
small cell sizes.

Random error and suppression 
*****************************

The DCRP data on deaths in state prisons and local jails are 
not subject to sampling error. However, mortality data from 
a complete or near-complete enumeration may be subject to 
random error. Following the methodology of Brillinger and 
NCHS, “the number of deaths that actually occurred may be 
considered as one of a large series of possible results that 
could have arisen under the same set of circumstances” 
(NCHS, 2007). The random variation can be large when the 
number of deaths is small, so caution is warranted when 
interpreting statistics based on small numbers of deaths. 
According to NCHS standards, mortality rates based on fewer 
than 100 deaths per year should be interpreted with caution. 
For more information on vital rates, see Brillinger, D.R. 
(1986). The natural variability of vital rates and 
associated statistics. Biometrics 42:693-734. See also  
National Vital Statistics Reports. Deaths: Final Data for 
2007, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National 
Center for Health Statistics. Retrieved from 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr58/nvsr58_19.pdf.

Continuing to use the NCHS and Brillinger methods, BJS 
quantified random variation by assuming that the appropriate 
underlying probability distribution for the number of deaths 
is a Poisson distribution. This provides for a 
computationally simple, as well as reasonable, approach to 
estimating variances for mortality statistics when the 
probability of dying is low. BJS calculated variances based 
on the assumption of a Poisson process. From these 
variances, BJS calculated relative random error estimates, 
which are comparable to relative standard error in that the 
relative random error is the ratio of random error derived 
from the Poisson variance to the number of deaths. Following 
NCHS, when the relative random error exceeded 30 percent, 
BJS flagged estimated mortality rates due to the instability 
of the rate.

Survey performance issues
**************************

Survey administration and modifications to the survey form 
generated data from 2007 to 2009 that may not be wholly 
compatible with prior DCRP data. In 2012, BJS identified a 
previously undetected data error that mischaracterized over 
600 illness-related deaths as illness-related deaths missing 
detailed cause-of-death information, leading to an inflated 
frequency of prison deaths in reference year 2007 being 
characterized as all other illnesses while simultaneously 
depressing frequencies of known illnesses (e.g., heart 
disease, cancer, or liver disease). The error was identified 
and resolved, correcting the distributions. In 2008, local 
jail officials were unable to provide causes of death for 
21.4% of jail inmate deaths. During 2009, BJS made 
modifications to the collection instruments to improve 
reporting and reduce burden.

* Item nonresponse in 2008 jail data and unknown cause of 
death: An abnormally large number of cases were missing a 
response for cause of death in the 2008 jail file (n=203; 
21.4% of all jail deaths in 2008). This coincided with the 
final year the U.S. Census Bureau acted as the data 
collection agent for the DCRP. In prior years of the DCRP 
jail data collection, an average of 6% of all causes of 
death were classified as other or unknown. For this report, 
BJS categorized all of these 203 jail deaths from 2008 as 
missing data about cause of death.

* 2009 data collection: Prior to fielding the 2009 DCRP 
collection, BJS reviewed the data collection instrument and 
data submission procedures and assessed the communications 
with DCRP respondents with the goal of reducing the burden 
on respondents. The survey was modified to facilitate 
navigation and to encourage online response. The 
modifications led to delays in implementing data collection. 
As a result, death reports were not collected in the year 
the deaths occurred, but were instead collected 
retrospectively during 2010 for the first time. Data 
collection for subsequent years resumed on a normal 
schedule.
