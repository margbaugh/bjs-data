Advance count of executions in 2016
************************************


From January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2016, five states executed 20 inmates, 
which was eight fewer inmates than the number executed in 2015. This was 
the smallest number of executions since 1991 when 14 inmates were executed.

Two states accounted for 80% of the executions during this period: Georgia 
executed nine inmates, and Texas executed seven.

All executions in 2016 were by lethal injection.

No women were executed during this period.

Methodology
**************

Capital punishment information is collected annually as part of the National 
Prisoner Statistics program (NPS-8). This data series is collected in two parts: 
(1) data on persons under sentence of death are obtained from the department of 
corrections in each jurisdiction currently authorizing capital punishment, and 
(2) the status of death penalty statutes is obtained from the Office of the 
Attorney General in each of the 50 states, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the 
District of Columbia, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons for the federal 
government. Data collection forms are available at www.bjs.gov.

NPS-8 covers all persons under sentence of death at any time during the year 
who were held in a state or federal nonmilitary correctional facility. This 
includes capital offenders transferred from prison to mental hospitals and 
those who may have escaped from custody. It excludes persons whose death 
sentences have been overturned by the court, regardless of their current 
incarceration status.

The data in this report may differ from data collected by other organizations 
for several reasons:

* NPS-8 adds inmates to the population under sentence of death not at sentencing 
but at the time they are admitted to a state or federal correctional facility. 

* If inmates entered prison under a death sentence or were reported as being relieved 
of a death sentence in one year but the court had acted in the previous year, the 
counts are adjusted to reflect the dates of court decisions.

* NPS counts are always for the last day of the calendar year and will differ 
from counts for more recent periods.
