Highlights

The rates at which black and white persons
experienced violent victimization were converging
between 1993 and 1998.

*  In 1998, per 1,000 persons age 12 or older in
each racial group, 110 American Indians, 43 blacks,
38 whites, and 22 Asians were victims of violence.

*  In each year from 1993 to 1997, black persons
were victimized at rates significantly greater than
those of whites.  By 1998 black and white persons
were victimized overall at similar rates.

*  The rate of violent victimization of whites fell
29% and of blacks fell 38%, 1993-98.  Over the same
period no measurable change in the victimization
rates of American Indians or Asians occurred.

*  From 1993 to 1998 violent crime in which the
race of the offender was known was largely
intraracial for whites (66%) and blacks (76%).  
For American Indian and Asian victims, violent 
crime was primarily interracial.

*  From 1993 to 1998 higher percentages of black
(36%) and Asian (32%) victims than of white (24%)
and American Indian (28%) victims faced an armed
offender.  Higher percentages of black (18%) and
Asian (14%)  victims than of American Indian (9%)
and white (8%) victims faced an offender with a
firearm.
 
*  48% of the violence against blacks, 42% against
whites, 46% against American Indians, and 41%
against Asians were reported to the police,
1993-98.

* Blacks were disproportionately represented among
homicide victims. In 1998, 4 whites, 23 blacks, and
3 persons of other races (Asians and American
Indians considered together) were murdered per
100,000 persons in each group.

*  On average each year between 1993 and 1998,
homicide rates fell 5% for whites, 7% for blacks,
and 8% for persons of other races.
--------------------------------------------------------

Estimates from the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS) indicate that between 1993 and 1998
compared to people of other races American Indians
sustained violence at the highest per capita rate
(119 victimizations per 1,000 American Indians age
12 or older).  This rate of violent victimization
is about 2 times that experienced by blacks, 2 1/2
times that sustained by whites, and 4 1/2 times
that experienced by Asians.

Between 1993 and 1998 violent victimization rates
declined for whites and blacks.  Because of a
greater decline in black victimization rates
during this period, by 1998 black and white
overall violent crime rates were similar.  Over
the same period, apparent changes in the per
capita violent victimization rates of American
Indians and Asians were not significant.  

Data

Findings about rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
assault come from National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS) data collected by the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS).  Findings about homicide
come from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)
program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI).  

This report presents rates and characteristics of
violent victimization of whites, blacks, American
Indians, and Asians. 
The racial categories are separate from 
Hispanic ethnicity and include Hispanic 
and non-Hispanic persons. (* For information 
about Hispanic and non-Hispanic victimization, 
see Criminal Victimization 1999, Changes 
1998-99, with Trends 1993-99, August 2000, 
NCJ 182734.)  

Violent victimization and race, 
1993-98

American Indians experienced overall violence,
aggravated assault, simple assault, and serious
violent crimes at rates higher than those for
whites, blacks, and Asians, 1993-98.  Asians
sustained overall violence, aggravated assault,
simple assault, and serious violent crimes at per
capita rates lower than all other groups during
the same period.

On average, American Indians (10.8 robberies per
1,000 persons age 12 or older) and blacks (10.6)
were victims of robbery at similar rates, 1993-98. 
These rates were higher than those of whites (4.4)
and Asians (5.7), which, in turn, were similar. 
 
From 1993 to 1998 the average annual rate of rape
or sexual assault was somewhat higher for American
Indians than that for blacks, and significantly
higher for American Indians than that for Asians
and whites.  The rates for rape or sexual assault
for Asians and whites were similar during this
period.

Characteristics of violent crime 
victims, 1993-98

Victimization research consistently demonstrates a
relationship between several demographic attributes
and the rate of victimization.  When examining 
victimization differences by race, it is important 
to account for these factors, which include gender, 
age, ethnicity, income, marital status and location 
of residence.  The patterns that emerge suggest that 
each of these characteristics taken alone does not 
account entirely for the violent victimization rates 
among racial groups.

Gender

Among males, without exception, overall
victimization rates for each racial group differed
significantly from all others. American Indian
males were victims of overall violent crime at a
rate about twice the rate of blacks, 22 times the
rate of whites, and 4 times the rate of Asians.

Rates of aggravated assault against males also
differed among the races, 1993-98.  American
Indians were victims of aggravated assaults at a
rate greater than that of blacks, who were
victimized at a rate greater than that of whites,
who were victimized at a rate greater than that of
Asians.

American Indians and violent crime

For more information about American Indians and
their experiences with violent crime, convictions
and correctional supervision, see American Indians
and Crime, BJS report, February 1999, NCJ 173386. 
Highlights of this report include:

* Indigenous people in the United States belong to
about 550 federally recognized tribes that have a
distinct history and culture and often a separate
language.  

* A higher percentage of American Indian victims
of violent crime than victims of other races
stated the offender was drinking or on drugs,
1992-96.

* About 4% of the American Indian population age 18
or older were under the care, custody, or control
of the criminal justice system on an average day,
1992-96.  By comparison, an estimated 2% of white
adults, 10% of black adults, and less than half of
1% of Asian adults were under correctional
supervision.
--------------------------------

For serious violent crime the same pattern of
differences between the races emerged, with one
exception: Asian and white males had similar per
capita rates, 1993-98.  

Among females, American Indians were victims of
overall violence and serious violence at per capita
rates greater than those of blacks, who were
victimized at rates greater than those of whites,
and whites were victimized at rates greater than
those of Asians.

Apparent differences in rape and sexual assault
rates between American Indian, white, and black
females were not significant.  Asian females had a
rate of rape or sexual assault that was slightly
lower than the rate for American Indian females and
significantly lower than those for white and black
females, 1993-98. 

Age      

Within each age category and with few exceptions,
American Indians experienced overall violent crime
at the highest rate, Asians at the lowest rate, and
blacks and whites at similar rates, 1993-98.  An 
exception was among persons ages 12 to 15 for whom 
apparent differences in victimization rates between 
American Indians, blacks, and whites were not 
significant.

Ethnicity

Ethnicity is defined independently of race. 
Therefore, an individual may be described as
Hispanic or non-Hispanic and of any race examined.

Among Hispanics, American Indians were victims of
overall violence at rates greater than rates for
whites, blacks, and Asians, 1993-98. During the 
same period Hispanic blacks were victimized at 
rates greater than rates for Hispanic whites and 
Asians.  Hispanic Asians and whites were
victimized at similar rates, 1993-98.   

Among non-Hispanics, American Indians were victims
of overall violence at rates greater than those for
whites, blacks, and Asians, 1993-98.  During the
same period blacks were victimized at rates greater
than rates for whites and Asians, and Asians were
victimized at the lowest rates.  The same pattern
existed among non-Hispanics for aggravated assault
rates and for serious violent crime.

Marital status

Among persons who were married and those who never
married, American Indians were victims of overall
violence at rates greater than rates for whites
and blacks, and whites and blacks were victimized
at rates greater than that for Asians, 1993-98.  
American Indians who never married sustained overall 
violence at about twice the per capita rate of whites 
and blacks who never married.  American Indians who 
were divorced or separated were victimized at about 
3 times the rate of divorced or separated Asians 
during this time.

Among widowed persons, blacks experienced almost
twice the rate of overall violence as whites. 
Small sample sizes prevent testing the apparent
differences across races in the widowed category.

As with overall violent crime, American Indians in
most marital categories experienced serious
violent crime at rates greater than those for
persons in other racial categories.  Among those
divorced or separated, American Indians were
victimized at rates slightly greater than rates
for Asians, and significantly greater than rates
for blacks and whites.  Among married persons for
serious violent crime, rates for each racial group
differed significantly from all others.

Place of residence

American Indians experienced the highest rates of
overall and serious violent crimes regardless of
the locality of residence considered.

American Indians in urban areas sustained overall
violence at about 2 times the rate of blacks and
whites and 5 times the rates of Asians.  American
Indians in urban areas experienced serious violence
at about 2 times the rate of blacks, 3 times the
rate of whites, and 5 times the rate of Asians,
1993-98. 

Household income

Generally, when considered by income levels,
American Indians experienced overall violence at
the highest rate, Asians experienced overall
violence at the lowest rate, and blacks and whites
experienced overall violence at similar rates,
1993-98.  Exceptions include those earning between 
$15,000 and $24,999 and over $50,000 annually: 
blacks and American Indians experienced overall 
violence at similar rates. Expressed as rates per 
1,000 persons, blacks were victimized more than 
whites among those earning from $7,500 to $34,999 
annually. 

Fewer racial differences emerge for serious violent
crime.  In general, blacks and American Indians
experienced serious violent crime at similar rates,
and their rates were higher than rates for whites
and Asians.

Owned versus rented residence     
                        
Within the "owned housing" group, American Indians
sustained violence at a rate about twice the per
capita rates for blacks and whites, and 3 1/2 times
the rate for Asians.  Blacks were victimized at 
rates higher than those for whites, and whites 
were victimized overall at rates greater than those 
for Asians.  
 
Within the "rented housing" group, American Indians
sustained violence at about twice the rate for
whites and blacks, and 5 1/2 times the rate for
Asians.  While there was no measurable difference
between the rate of black and white overall
victimization, both groups were victimized at rates
greater than that for Asians, 1993-98.

Victimization trends, 1993-98 
              
The rate of violent victimization against whites
fell 29%, and that of blacks fell 38%, 1993-98.
Over the same period apparent changes in the
victimization rates of American Indians and Asians
were not significant.

For whites, in addition to a decline in rates of
overall violence, rates of specific types of
violence decreased 1993-98:  a 44% decline in rape
and sexual assault rates, a 39% decline
in aggravated assault rates, and a 30% decline in
robbery rates.  

For blacks, the rate of all types of violence
except rape and sexual assault fell 1993-98: a 62%
decrease in robbery rates, a 42% decline in
aggravated assault rates, and 30% decline in
simple assault rates.

The rate at which American Indians sustained
overall violence did not change significantly
between 1993 and 1998; however, the rate at which
American Indians experienced serious violent crime
declined slightly, 1993-98. Declines in rates of
overall and serious violent crime against Asians
between 1993 and 1998 were not significant. 
Because of a lack of sample cases, trends of rates
for specific types of crime against Asians and
American Indians were not examined.  

The rate at which non-Hispanic whites,
non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics (regardless of
race) experienced overall and serious violence
declined between 1993 and 1998. 
Non-Hispanic whites experienced violent
victimization at rates 27% lower  in 1998 than 
in 1993.  Among non-Hispanic blacks violent
victimization rates fell 38% from 1993 to 1998,
and among Hispanics, 45%. 

Declines in victimization rates were more
pronounced for serious violent crime than for
violent crime overall.  Hispanics experienced
serious violent crimes at rates 54% lower in 
1998 than in 1993.  Serious violent victimization 
rates were 36% lower for white non-Hispanics and 
47% lower for black non-Hispanics during this time.

For non-Hispanic American Indians and Asians there
were no measurable changes in overall and serious
violent victimization rates from 1993 to 1998. 

Characteristics of the violent crime event, 
1993-98

Time and location 

The largest percentage of violent crime occurred
in open areas for each racial group. Between 1993 
and 1998, 27% of Asian, 26% of black, 23% of American 
Indian, and 20% of white victims were victimized in 
an open area.    

Blacks were victimized at their homes in
percentages similar to American Indians, and
higher than whites and Asians.  Blacks were
victimized in commercial locations in lower
percentages than other racial groups.  

Whites were victimized in school in higher
percentages (14%) than blacks and American Indians
(11% and 6%) between 1993-98.  American Indians
were victimized in schools in percentages lower
than all other groups. 

Whites, blacks, and Asians were victimized during
the day in similar percentages.  These percentages
are greater than the percentage of American
Indians victimized during the day.  Fifty-two
percent of American Indians were victimized at
night.  Slightly more than 4 in 10 whites (44%),
blacks (44%), and Asians (43%) were victimized at
night between 1993-98.
 
Presence of weapons

All violent crime victims were more likely to face
an unarmed than an armed offender, 1993-98.  Black 
victims (36%) faced an armed offender in percentages 
similar to those for Asians (32%), and in percentages 
higher than those for white (24%) and American 
Indian (28%) victims. 

Black and Asian victims were more likely to face
an offender with a firearm than were white and
American Indian victims.  During this time, 18% of
black victims, 14% of Asian victims, 9% of
American Indian victims, and 8% of white victims
faced an offender with a firearm. 

Injuries and medical treatment

Most victims of violent crime were not injured,
1993-98.  Seventy-seven percent of Asian, 76% 
of white, 71% of black, and 65% of American 
Indians victims were uninjured as a result of 
violence that they sustained. 

Larger percentages of American Indians and blacks
(35% and 29%) were injured from violent crime than
were whites and Asians (24% and 23%), 1993-98.

American Indians were seriously injured in
percentages similar to blacks, slightly higher
than those of Asians, and significantly higher
than those of whites. Serious injuries include
gunshot wounds, knife wounds, rape, internal
injuries, broken bones, and being knocked
unconscious.  

A higher percentage of American Indians received
minor injuries than whites and Asians.  Blacks
sustained  minor injuries in slightly higher
percentages than whites, 1993-98.  Minor injuries
include bruises, cuts,  scratches, black eyes,
swelling, and chipped teeth.

Among injured victims, whites and Asians were less
likely to receive treatment than were blacks and
American Indians.

Reporting victimizations to the police

For blacks and whites between 1993 and 1998,
violence against females is reported to the police
in greater percentages than violence against
males.  There was no difference in the percentage
of violence reported to the police based on the
victim's gender for American Indians and Asians.  

Among male victims, violence was reported in
similar percentages across racial categories. 
Among female victims, violence against blacks
(53%) and American Indians (52%) was reported to
police in similar percentages.  The percentage of
violence against black females reported to the
police was higher than violence against whites
(45%) and Asians (41%).  The percentage of
violence against white and Asian females reported
to the police was similar.

The reporting of the victimization of whites has
increased significantly from 40% to 45% between
1993 and 1998, as determined by a linear trend
test.  Apparent changes, 1993 to 1998, in 
percentage of victimizations reported to police 
were not statistically significant for other racial 
categories.

Victims' race and the reasons for not reporting a
victimization to the police were unrelated,
1993-98.  The primary reason given for not
reporting a victimization to police was that the
incident was a "private or personal matter," that
it was minor involving "no loss," or that it was
"reported to another official."

-------------------------------------
Intimate partner violence, 1993-98

Between 1993 and 1998, an average of 1.1 million
violent crimes were committed against persons by
their current or former spouses, boyfriends, or
girlfriends annually.  An average of 87% of this
violence, termed intimate partner violence, was
committed against women.

Between 1993 and 1998 intimate partner
victimization of women differed by race.  American
Indians were victimized by an intimate at rates
higher than those for all other females -- 23
American Indians per 1,000 persons age 12 or older
compared to 11 blacks, 8 whites, and 2 Asians.  
Black females were victimized at higher rates than
white and Asian females, and white females
experienced violence by an intimate at rates
higher than Asians.

Trends in intimate partner violence 

The rate of intimate partner violence against
white females fell significantly between 1993 and
1998, from 10 victimizations to 8 victimizations
per 1,000 women.  

The apparent decline in the rate of intimate
partner violence against black females as measured
by comparing the 1993 and 1998 rates was not
significant.  Insufficient sample sizes for
American Indian and Asian females prevented
examination of trends.

Note:  Multiple-offender victimizations are
classified by the most intimate relationship
between the victim and one of the offenders.
There were too few cases of Asian and
American Indian females to provide reliable
estimates for each year.
 
Among white males there was no discernible trend
in the occurrence of intimate partner violence. 
The rate in 1998 was similar to the 1993 rate. 
There were too few sample cases for black,
American Indian, and Asian males for estimation of
changes in rates by year. 

Reporting of intimate partner violence 

Intimate partner violence is reported to police in
lower percentages than violent crime in general. 
The percentage of intimate partner violence
against females reported to police did not differ
by the race of the victim, 1993-98.  The only
exception was that 66% of violence by intimates
against black females was reported to police
compared to 51% of violence against white females. 
The percentage of violence against white, Asian
(52%), and American Indian (51%) females reported
between 1993 and 1998 was similar (not shown in
table).

Note:  Multiple-offender victimizations are
classified by the most intimate relationship
between the victim and one of the offenders.
There were too few cases of black, Asian, an
American Indian males to provide reliable
estimates for each year.
 
Reasons for not reporting the victimization were
similar across the victims' racial groups,
1993-98.  Violence by intimates against females
was not reported to police most commonly because
the victim stated it was a "private or personal
matter."  Other commonly stated reasons this
violence was not reported to the police was
because the victim "feared reprisal" and the
victim wished to "protect the offender."

Note:  Percentages may not total to 100% because
respondents could suggest more than one reason. "Other
reason given" include responses such as "police
ineffectiveness or biased,"  "not clear a crime occurred,"
"inconvenient," and "reported to another official."  There
were too few cases of Asians and American Indians to
provide reliable individual year estimates.

Victim-offender characteristics, 
1993-98

Victim-offender relationship and gender

Males were victimized by strangers at
significantly higher percentages than by
nonstrangers regardless of race, 1993-98.  
When the offender was someone known to the
male victim, it was most often a friend or
acquaintance. 

American Indian males were more likely to identify
the offender as an "other relative" than were
males of other races.  "Other relatives" can
include a parent, stepparent, child, stepchild,
brother, sister, or other related person.  Asian
males were victimized by a stranger at higher
percentages, and by a nonstranger at lower
percentages, than other males.  

Victim-offender relationships among females
differed somewhat across racial categories. 
Black, white, and American Indian females were
more likely to be victimized by someone they knew,
1993-98.  Asian females were equally likely to be
victimized by a stranger or a nonstranger during
this time.

Asian females were less likely to be victimized by
a nonstranger, and more likely to be victimized by
a stranger, than other females.  Asian females
were equally likely as American Indian females to
be victimized by an intimate, and less likely than
white or black females to be victimized by an
intimate. Asian females were significantly more
likely to say that the offender was a friend or
acquaintance than were white or black females.

Victim and offender race

Violent crime was primarily intraracial for black
and white victims.  Sixty-six percent of white 
victims and 76% of black victims were victimized 
by an offender of the same race, 1993-98 (when the 
race of the offender was known). 

Violent crime was primarily interracial for
American Indian and Asian victims.  Fifty-eight
percent of the American Indian victims and 35% of
the Asian victims of violence stated the offender
was white. 

Offenders were identified as black by 10% of the
American Indian and 26% of the Asian victims.  A
quarter of American Indian and about a third of
Asian victims were victimized by an offender
described as "other races." Because the NCVS
collects data for offenders whom victims describe
as white, black, and "other race," it is not
possible to report on American Indian or Asian
offenders separately.

Survey methodology

This Special Report presents data on rape, sexual
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple
assault from the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS), and data on homicide from the FBI's
Uniform Crime Reporting Program.  The NCVS gathers
data on crimes against persons age 12 or older,
reported and not reported to the police, from a
nationally representative sample of U.S.
households.  The NCVS provides information about
victims (age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital
status, income, and educational level), offenders
(gender, race, approximate age, and
victim-offender relations) and the nature of the
crime (time and place of occurrence, use of
weapons, nature of injury, and economic
consequences).  

Between 1993 and 1998 approximately 293,400
households and 574,000 individuals age 12 or older
were interviewed.  For the NCVS data presented,
response rates varied between 93% and 96% of
eligible households and between 89% and 92% of
eligible individuals. 

In some instances the sample size used to generate
an estimate is small.  For instance the sample of
Asian males experiencing intimate partner violence
was fewer than ten for every year from 1993
through 1998.  While the estimate is reliable it
is also likely associated with a relatively large
confidence interval and should be viewed with
caution.

Testing trends and annual differences in violent
victimization 

When a statement is made describing the increase
or decrease of a linear trend, it was tested using
a linear trend test.  This test compares the slope
of the trend to a horizontal line that has a slope
of zero, determining whether the slope generated
from a change in an estimate differs from a flat
trend.  

The linear trend test was conducted as a
regression equation with an independent variable
of time and a dependent variable of the
victimization rate.  A regression coefficient (b)
and its corresponding standard error (F) are
computed, and a t-statistic -- the ratio b/F C is
calculated.  If the t-statistic is greater than
1.96 for a two-tailed test (or greater than 1.645
for a one-tailed test), the slope is considered
significantly different from zero.  If the
t-statistic is greater than 1.645 for a two-tailed
test (or 1.28 for a one-tailed test), the slope is
considered slightly different from zero.  If the
t-statistics are less than the critical values,
the analyst must conclude that the change in the
estimate did not differ significantly from zero
and was not statistically significant.

Standard error computations

Comparisons of percentages and rates made in this
report were tested to determine if observed
differences were statistically significant. 
Differences described as higher, lower, or
different passed a hypothesis test at the .05
level of statistical significance (95% confidence
level).  The tested difference was greater than
twice the standard error of that difference.  
For comparisons that were statistically
significant at the 0.10 level (90% confidence
level), "somewhat," "slightly," or "marginally" is
used to note the nature of the difference. 
                   
Caution is required when comparing estimates not
explicitly discussed in this Special Report.  What
may appear to be large differences may not test as
statistically significant at the 95% or the 90%
confidence level.  Significance testing
calculations were conducted at the Bureau of
Justice Statistics using statistical programs 
developed specifically for the NCVS by the U.S. 
Bureau of the Census.  These programs take into 
consideration many aspects of the complex NCVS 
sample design when calculating generalized variance 
estimates.

Definitions

In the NCVS the household respondent identifies
the race of each household member by choosing from
a flashcard.  These categories and their
corresponding race defined in this report follow:

Flashcard category           Report category

White                        White
Black                        Black
American Indian              American Indian
Aleut                        American Indian
Eskimo                       American Indian
Asian (Japanese, Chinese     Asian
Korean, Asian Indian,
Vietnamese, and other
Asian)
Pacific Islander (Filipino   Asian
Hawaiian, Guamanian,
Samoan, and other Asian)

Violent acts covered in this report include
murder, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, and simple assault.  Overall violent
crime is a combination of each type of crime. 
Serious violent crime includes all types except
simple assault: rape/sexual assault, robbery, and
aggravated assault.  Note that for most tables
homicide was not included in the analyses because
data are not available for Asians and American
Indians.  Definitions are as follows:

Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter are defined
as the willful killing of one human being by
another.  

Rape is forced sexual intercourse, including both
psychological coercion and physical force.  Forced
sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or oral
penetration by the offender(s).  This category
includes incidents where the penetration is from a
foreign object such as a bottle.  Also included
are attempted rapes, male and female victims, and
heterosexual and homosexual rape.

Sexual assault covers a wide range of
victimizations distinct from rape or attempted
rape.  These crimes include completed or attempted
attacks generally involving unwanted sexual
contact between the victim and offender.  Sexual
assaults may or may not involve force and include
such things as grabbing or fondling.  Sexual
assault also includes verbal threats. 

Robbery is a completed or attempted theft directly
from a person, of property or cash by force or
threat of force, with or without a weapons, and
with or without an injury.  

Aggravated assault is defined as a completed or
attempted attack with a weapon, regardless of
whether or not an injury occurred, and an attack
without a weapon in which the victim is seriously
injured.  

Simple assault is an attack without a weapon
resulting either in no injury, minor injury (such
as bruises, black eyes, cuts, scratches or
swelling) or an undetermined injury requiring less
than 2 days of hospitalization.  Simple assaults
also include attempted assaults without a weapon.
