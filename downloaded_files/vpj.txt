In 1998 there were an estimated 25,062,400 veterans in the 
United States population, including 225,700 veterans held in 
the Nation's prisons and jails.  Males comprised 95% of all 
veterans and 99% of those veterans in prison and jail.  Among 
adult males in 1998, there were 937 incarcerated veterans per 
100,000 veteran residents, up from 571 per 100,000 in 1985.  
Despite the increase, male veterans were incarcerated at less 
than half the rate of adult male nonveterans (1,971 per 100,000) 
in 1998.

Since 1985 the number of U.S. veterans has declined by nearly 
3 million, an average decline of 1% per year.  The number of 
male veterans dropped from 26,962,000 in 1985 to 23,834,100 in 
1998, while the number of female veterans rose from 1,044,700 
to 1,228,300.  The number in prison or jail rose from 154,600 
in 1985 to 225,700 in 1998, an increase of 46%.  However, 
during this period the number of nonveteran inmates rose 172%.  
Veterans accounted for 12% of all inmates in 1998, down from 
21% in 1985.

These data are based on interviews with national samples of 
inmates.  In responses to the 1997 Survey of Inmates in State 
and Federal Correctional Facilities and the 1996 Survey of Inmates 
in Local Jails, inmates provided information on their military 
service, as well as their criminal history and personal background.

Veterans include all persons with prior 
military service
 
In this BJS Special Report, the term "veteran" is defined as any 
person who has reported prior service in the United States 
Armed Forces, regardless of the type of military discharge.  This 
definition differs from that used by the Department of Veterans 
Affairs (VA) to determine eligibility for various veteran benefit 
programs, as it includes persons not honorably discharged and a 
small number of persons awaiting discharge.  However, VA counts 
of veterans in the U.S. resident population and BJS counts of 
those in prison or jail employ comparable definitions that include 
all types of discharges.

The percentage of veterans in the U.S. population who had not 
been honorably discharged is unknown.  Data from the Defense 
Manpower Data Center indicate that 9.5% of the 217,600 officers 
and enlisted persons discharged from the U.S. Armed Forces during 
fiscal year 1999 were not honorably discharged (including 
dishonorable, bad conduct, other than honorable, and general 
discharges).

Not honorably discharged veterans are found in incarcerated 
populations in higher proportions -- 17% of veterans held in 
State prison, 15% of those in Federal prison, and 14% of those 
in local jails.  Veterans in prison who had not been honorably 
discharged from military service have more serious criminal and 
substance abuse histories than other incarcerated veterans.

Number of U.S. veterans declining; number 
held in prison and jail rising 

In 1998 the veteran population in the United States totaled 25 
million, but the number has been steadily declining.  The Department 
of Veterans Affairs, using data from the decennial census, annual 
discharge data, and mortality rates, reports that the number of male 
veterans has dropped by more than 3 million since 1985.  Veterans 
accounted for 1 in 3 adult male residents in 1985 but declined to 
1 in 4 by 1998.  During the same period, the number of female 
veterans has risen by over 180,000.  Overall, the number of 
veterans has declined nearly 1% per year since 1985.

In BJS surveys of jail and prison inmates conducted since the 
mid-1980's, a declining percentage reported prior military service.  
Veterans accounted for 13% of State prisoners in 1997 and 12% of 
jail inmates in 1996, down from 20% in 1986 and 21% in 1983, 
respectively.  While these percentages declined, the overall size 
of the prison and jail populations rose sharply.  Between 1985 and 
1998, the number of prison and jail inmates grew by over 1 million.  
As a result, the number of incarcerated veterans also rose, from 
154,600 in 1985 to 225,700 in 1998.

Among adult males -- who comprise 95% of all veterans -- the 
incarceration rate of veterans has remained far lower than that 
of nonveterans.  In 1985 there were 571 incarcerated male veterans 
per 100,000 male veteran residents, compared to a rate of 965 per 
100,000 among male nonveterans. In 1998 the rate of male veterans 
had increased to 937 but was still less than half that of 
nonveterans (1,971).

Nearly 60% of incarcerated veterans 
had served in the Army

Veterans in prison and jail had served in all branches of the U.S. 
Armed Forces, including the U.S. Coast Guard and National Guard.  
Although the U.S. Army has accounted for less than 40% of U.S. 
military personnel since 1971, Army veterans made up a majority of 
veterans incarcerated in both State (59%) and Federal (58%) prison, 
as well as local jails (57%).  The Air Force accounted for an average 
of 29% of U.S. military personnel between 1960 and 1996, but Air Force
veterans made up 9% of veterans in State prison, 12% of those in Federal
prison, and 10% of veterans in local jails.  (For details on military
personnel data see Methodology.)

Veterans' mean length of military service was about the same among 
jail inmates (44 months) and State (45 months) and Federal (48 months)
prisoners.  Veterans held in Federal prison were the least likely to 
report less than a year of military service (10%), followed by veterans 
in local jails (14%) and State prison (15%).

1 in 5 incarcerated veterans saw combat duty 
during their service

About equal percentages of veterans in State and Federal prisons 
(20% of each) and local jails (21%) reported seeing combat duty 
during their military service.  A larger percentage of the veterans 
in prison (50% of State and 61% of Federal) had served during a 
period of wartime.

*Veterans may have served during more than one period of wartime.

The reported wartime experience of  incarcerated veterans changed 
after 1991, reflecting the end of the Persian Gulf War and the 
effects of aging among veterans from previous wars and military 
conflicts.  In 1997 Vietnam-era veterans were still the most 
common wartime veterans, accounting for 35% of veterans in State 
prison and 43% of those in Federal prison.  This represented a 
decline from 1991, when Vietnam-era veterans made up 42% and 49% 
of State and Federal prison veterans, respectively.

In 1997 Persian Gulf War-era veterans made up 12% of State and 
13% of Federal prison veterans.  Veterans who served during the 
Korean Conflict era accounted for 3% of State and 5% of Federal 
prison veterans, down from 6% and 9%, respectively in 1991.  One 
percent of both State and Federal prison veterans reported 
military service during World War II.

A majority of veterans in State prison, 
but less than a third of nonveteran inmates, 
were white

Because nearly 95% of veterans are men, virtually all incarcerated 
veterans in 1997 were men.   Among nonveterans women accounted for 
7% of State prisoners, 8% of Federal prisoners, and 11% of local 
jail inmates.  In contrast, women accounted for 1% of the veterans 
in either State or Federal prison, and 2% of veterans in local jails.

Veterans were also more likely than other inmates to be white 
non-Hispanic.  Among State prisoners, over half (53%) of veterans 
were white non-Hispanics, compared to nearly a third (31%) of 
nonveterans.  Among Federal prisoners the percentage of veterans 
who were white (50%) was nearly double that of nonveterans (26%).

In both prisons and jails, black non- Hispanics made up the 
largest share of nonveteran inmates.  Blacks made up 48% of 
the nonveterans in State prison, compared to 37% of veterans.  
The percentage of black inmates varied less by veteran status 
in Federal prison (38% of nonveterans, 35% of veterans) and 
local jails (41% of nonveterans and 37% of veterans).  

The percentage of Hispanics was sharply lower among veterans 
than nonveterans.  In both State and Federal prison, as well 
as local jails, the percentage of Hispanics among veterans was 
less than half that of nonveterans.  Federal prisoners displayed 
the largest difference, with Hispanics accounting for 30% of 
nonveterans and 12% of veterans.

Among State prisoners, the median age of veterans 
was 10 years higher than that of nonveterans

Veterans were much older than other prison and jail inmates.  
Among both State (41 years old) and Federal (43) prisoners, 
the median age of veterans was over age 40, while that of 
nonveterans was age 31 and 35, respectively. Nonveterans (63%) 
were almost 3 times as likely as veterans (23%) to be under 
age 35.  In contrast, 32% of veterans in State prison were 
at least age 45, compared to 10% of nonveterans.  

Veterans were also more likely to have been married than 
nonveterans.  Overall, 71% of veterans and 39% of nonveterans 
in State prison said they had been married at some time in 
their lives.  However, the percentages of veterans (22%) and 
nonveterans (16%) who said they were currently married were 
much more similar. 

Veterans reported much higher levels of completed education 
than other inmates.  Among State prisoners, veterans (32%) were 
about 3 times more likely than nonveterans (11%) to have attended 
college.  Even higher levels of college attendance were reported 
by veterans in local jail (37%) and Federal prison (42%).  
In contrast, 44% of nonveterans in State prison reported that 
they had neither completed high school nor attained a GED, 
compared to 12% of veterans.

Veteran inmates were more likely 
to be violent offenders, less likely 
to be drug offenders 

A majority (55%) of the veterans in State prison were sentenced 
for a violent offense, compared to 46% of nonveterans.  Among 
Federal prisoners fewer than a quarter of veterans (22%) were 
violent offenders, but the percentage was still lower among 
nonveterans (13%).  Veterans in both State (14%) and Federal 
(51%) prison were less likely to be drug offenders than 
nonveterans (22% and 65%, respectively).  

Among State prisoners veterans (18%) were over twice as likely 
as nonveterans (7%) to be sentenced for a sexual assault, including 
rape.  While veterans also had a slightly higher percentage of 
homicide offenders (17%) than nonveterans (13%), they were no more 
likely than other State prisoners to be sentenced for other types 
of violent crime.  In local jails, sexual assault was the only 
violent offense for which a greater share of veterans (6%) than 
nonveterans (3%) was held.  (For further data on sexual assaults 
and military personnel, see box below.)

About equal percentages of veterans and nonveterans in State 
prison were sentenced for property and public-order offenses.  
Among Federal prisoners, veterans had a higher percentage of 
fraud offenders (9%) than nonveterans (4%), but were otherwise 
equally likely to be convicted of property or public-order 
offenses.

Among local jail inmates veterans had a similar percentage of 
both violent (27%) and property (25%) offenders as nonveterans 
(26% and 27%, respectively).  Veterans (17%) in local jails 
were less likely to be drug offenders than nonveterans (23%), 
but more likely to be public-order offenders (31% compared 
to 23%).  

Sex offenders accounted for 1 in 3 prisoners 
held in military correctional facilities 
at yearend 1997

The high prevalence of sex offenders among incarcerated veterans 
is also reflected in data collected on persons still on active 
military duty.  Since 1994, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) 
Corrections Council has annually reported data to the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics regarding persons incarcerated in military 
correctional facilities.  These facilities, administered by the DoD, 
hold inmates whose offenses fell under the Uniform Code of Military 
Justice rather than civilian Federal, State, or local jurisdiction. 
(See Methodology.)

In 1997 sexual assault was the most common offense for which inmates 
were held in military prisons, accounting for nearly a third (31%) 
of all military prisoners.  Sexual assaults have also been the most 
common offense in each year since reporting began. All other violent 
offenses accounted for 21% of military prisoners, followed by drug 
(20%), property (17%), and public-order (2%) offenses.  Another 8% 
of military prisoners were sentenced for military offenses, including 
AWOL, desertion, and insubordination.

Among violent State prisoners, 
over two-thirds of veterans
knew their victims

Among violent State prisoners, veterans (69%) were more likely 
than nonveterans (51%) to have known their victims.  Veterans 
(22%) were twice as likely as other violent State prisoners 
(9%) to have victimized a relative (excluding spouses).  
Veterans (11%) were as likely as nonveterans (9%) to report 
victimizing an intimate, such as a spouse, girlfriend or boyfriend.  
A slightly higher percentage of veterans (32%) than nonveterans 
(27%) reported victimizing friends and acquaintances.  

About two-thirds of violent veterans, and half of other violent 
State prisoners reported victimizing a female.  A majority (54%) 
of veterans, compared to 36% of nonveterans, said that females were 
the only victims of their violent   offense.  About a third (36%) of 
veterans, but a majority of nonveterans (53%) said that only men had 
been the victims of their violent crime.  A tenth of both groups 
reported both male and female victims.  Fewer veterans (34%) than 
nonveterans (44%) reported using a weapon during their violent 
offense.

Veterans (36%) were more likely than nonveterans (20%) to have 
victimized a juvenile (under 18 years old).  In particular, twice 
as many veterans (20%) as nonveterans (9%) reported that their 
youngest victim was a child, age 12 or younger. 
 
Combat veterans in prison were no more 
likely to be violent offenders 
than other veterans

Among veterans in State prison, those who reported seeing combat 
duty during their military service were no more likely to be violent 
offenders than other veterans (55% of both).  Overall, the offense
distribution of   combat veterans showed few differences from that 
of noncombat veterans.  Combat veterans were also as likely to be 
property (19%) or drug (14%) offenders as noncombat veterans (21% 
and 15%, respectively).  

Veterans who had served in the military during the Vietnam War 
era (1964-1973) were more likely (59%) than other veterans in State 
prison (52%) to be violent offenders.  In particular, higher 
percentages of Vietnam-era veterans were sentenced for homicide 
(20%) compared to other veterans (14%).  Vietnam-era veterans (16%) 
were less likely than other veterans (23%) to be property offenders.  
About equal percentages of Vietnam-era veterans  were held for drug 
(15%) or public-order (10%) offenses as other veterans (14% for drug 
and 10% for public-order offenses).    

Among State prisoners, veterans 
had less extensive criminal histories 
than nonveterans

In State prisons veterans had less extensive criminal histories 
than other inmates.  At the time of their arrest, veterans were 
less likely than other State prisoners to be on probation or parole
supervision, bail, pretrial release or other forms of conditional 
release from custody.  About a third of veterans (36%) and half 
of nonveterans (49%) reported some type of criminal justice status 
when arrested.

Veterans in State prison were less likely than nonveterans to 
be recidivists (those inmates with a history of probation or 
incarceration sentences prior to their current confinement).  
Nearly a third of veterans were first-time offenders, while about 
a quarter of other prisoners did not report a prior sentence.  
Veterans in State prison were also less likely to have lengthy 
criminal records.  Offenders with at least three prior probation 
or incarceration sentences accounted for 37% of veterans, and 44% 
of the nonveterans in State prison.

In both local jails and Federal prisons, the criminal histories 
of veterans and nonveterans were more similar.  An equal percentage 
(27%) of both veterans and other local jail inmates were first-time 
offenders, without prior sentences.  Veterans (45%) were also as 
likely as other jail inmates (44%) to report three or more prior 
sentences.

In Federal prison veterans (60%) were as likely as nonveterans 
(61%) to report a prior sentence.  About 30% of both veterans and 
other Federal prisoners reported three or more prior probation or
incarceration sentences. 

Criminal histories of combat 
veterans were less serious than 
other veterans in prison

Veterans who had seen combat during their military service (29%) 
were less likely to have a criminal justice status when arrested 
than other veterans   (38%).  Forty percent of combat veterans were 
first-time offenders, compared to 27% of noncombat veterans.  Combat 
veterans (39%) were also less likely to be violent recidivists than 
other veterans (46%).

Overall, the criminal histories reported by Vietnam-era veterans 
in State prison were similar to those of other veterans. Similar 
percentages of Vietnam-era veterans (29%) and other veterans (31%) 
were first-time offenders.  Vietnam-era veterans (29%) were less 
likely than other veterans in State prison (40%) to have a criminal 
justice status at the time of their arrest.  
 
Veterans' sentences averaged 
3 years longer than other State 
prisoners

On average veterans were serving longer prison sentences than 
other inmates.  Among State prisoners, the mean maximum sentence 
length of veterans (191 months) was 3 years longer than that of 
nonveterans (152 months).  Veterans (26%) were more likely to 
report sentences of 20 or more years than nonveterans (20%), as 
well as life or death sentences (11% of veterans, 7% of 
nonveterans).  

These differences may reflect the higher percentage of violent 
offenders among veterans.  Since violent crimes carry longer 
sentences, veterans should be expected to have longer sentences 
than nonveterans.  In addition, veterans reported longer sentences 
than other prisoners with the same offenses.

Among violent offenders in State prison, the mean sentence length 
reported by veterans (264 months) was about 4 years longer than 
that of nonveterans (214 months).  In particular, veterans 
convicted of homicide (406 months) and robbery (267 months) 
reported mean sentence lengths that were over 6 years longer 
than those of nonveterans (328 months and 193 months, respectively).  

Among nonviolent offenders the sentences of veterans and nonveterans 
were more similar.  The mean drug offense sentence for veterans 
(118 months) was about a year longer than that of nonveterans 
(107 months). For both property and public-order offenders, the mean 
sentences reported by veterans (123 and 86 months, respectively) were 
7 months longer than those of nonveterans (116 and 79 months, 
respectively).

Among Federal prisoners, there was less variation in sentence 
lengths.  On average the sentences reported by veterans (135 months) 
were less than a year longer than those reported by nonveterans 
(124 months).  The percentages of veterans reporting sentences of 
20 or more years (15%), as well as life or death sentences (5%), 
were similar to nonveterans (13% and 3%, respectively).  The total 
time expected to be served by veterans (109 months) and nonveterans 
(103 months) varied by only 6 months.

Jail sentences showed no variation by veteran status.  The mean 
sentence lengths reported by veterans (13 months) and nonveterans 
(12 months) were nearly equal.  Veterans (8 months) and nonveterans 
(9 months) also expected to serve equal amounts of jail time prior 
to release.  

Veterans were less likely than other inmates 
to report using drugs in the month before 
their current offense

Among State prisoners, veterans (79%) were less likely than 
nonveterans (84%) to report past drug use.  The difference in drug 
use in the month before the offense was greater (45% of veterans, 
58% of nonveterans). In particular, fewer veterans (27%) than 
nonveterans (41%) reported marijuana use during this period.  
Veterans (26%) were also less likely than nonveterans (34%) to 
have been under the influence of drugs while committing their 
offense. 

In Federal prisons, veterans were as likely as other inmates (73% 
of both) to report past drug use.  Veterans (40%) were less likely 
than nonveterans (46%) to have used drugs in the month before the 
offense.  In local jails, veterans (81%) also reported levels of 
prior drug use similar to nonveterans (83%), but lower levels (44%) 
of drug use in the month prior to the offense than nonveterans (50%).  
At the time of the offense, veterans in both Federal prison (21%) 
and local jail (29%) were about as likely as nonveterans (23% Federal, 
32% local jails) to have been under the influence of drugs.

Among both State and Federal prisoners, as well as local jail 
inmates, the percentage of veterans who reported prior drug use was 
equal to, or lower than the percentage of nonveterans.  However, in 
all three groups, the percentage of veterans who reported past use
of specific drug types was often higher than that of nonveterans.  
For example, while veterans (81%) were about as likely as other jail 
inmates (83%) to report any prior drug use, veterans were more 
likely to have used heroin or other opiates (31%), depressants (38%),
stimulants (42%), and hallucinogens (38%) than nonveterans (23%, 29%, 
32%, and 31%, respectively).  These findings suggest that among past 
drug users in prisons and jails, veterans were more likely than 
nonveterans to have used multiple types of drugs.  

Veterans were also more likely to have used intravenous (IV) drugs 
than nonveterans.  Among both State and Federal prisoners, as well 
as jail inmates, a higher percentage of veterans than nonveterans 
reported prior IV drug use.   Veterans in State prison (25%) or 
local jails (24%) were the most likely to report prior IV drug use, 
followed by veterans in Federal prison (17%).  Among nonveterans, 
State prisoners (19%) reported the highest level of IV drug use, 
followed by local jail (16%) and Federal inmates (11%).

Less than a third of incarcerated 
combat veterans used drugs in the 
month before their offense

Veterans in State prison who saw combat during their military 
service were less likely to report prior drug use (69%) than 
noncombat veterans (82%).  Fewer than a third (30%) of combat 
veterans reported drug use in the month before their offense, 
compared to half (49%) of other veterans.  About a quarter of 
both combat (23%) and other veterans (25%) reported prior use 
of IV drugs.   

In their reports of prior drug abuse, Vietnam-era veterans varied 
little from other veterans in State prison.  Vietnam-era veterans 
(77%) were about as likely as other veterans (80%) to report ever 
using drugs, and slightly less likely to report drug use in the 
month before the offense (41%, compared to 47% of other veterans).  
However, a third (32%) of Vietnam-era veterans reported prior IV 
drug use.  Other veterans in State prison (20%) were no more 
likely than nonveterans (19%) to report prior IV drug use.

Reports of prior alcohol abuse and 
dependence were higher among 
veteran inmates

Veterans were more likely than other prison and jail inmates to 
report a variety of alcohol abuse indicators.  According to the 
CAGE diagnostic instrument, 31% of veterans in State prison and 
35% of those in local jails reported experiences that are consistent 
with a history of alcohol abuse or dependence.  Nonveterans in both 
State prison (24%) and local jail (25%) were less likely to report 
these signs of alcohol dependence.  Overall, fewer Federal prisoners 
were alcohol dependent, but reports were higher among veterans (21%) 
than nonveterans (15%).

CAGE is an acronym for the four questions used by the diagnostic 
instrument to assess alcohol dependence and abuse. Respondents are 
asked if they have ever attempted to (C)ut back on drinking; ever 
been (A)nnoyed by others' criticism of their drinking; ever felt 
(G)uilty about their drinking; and ever needed a drink first thing 
in the morning as an (E)ye opener or to steady the nerves.  The CAGE
instrument determines a person's likelihood of alcohol abuse by 
the number of positive responses to these questions.  (For additional
information on the CAGE instrument, see Methodology.)

A consistently higher percentage of veterans also reported engaging 
in troubled behaviors associated with past alcohol abuse.  Veterans 
in both State (59%) and Federal (55%) prison were more likely 
to report driving drunk in the past than nonveterans (45% and 41%,
respectively).  About half (48%) of veterans, but less than a third 
(30%) of nonveterans in local jails reported a previous alcohol-
related arrest.  Veterans in local jails were also more likely to 
report alcohol-related physical fights (45%) than nonveterans (35%).  
Prior binge drinking incidents -- consuming as much as a fifth of 
liquor in 1 day -- were reported by 49% of veterans, compared to 
39% of other jail inmates.

According to the CAGE diagnostic questionnaire, similar percentages 
of Vietnam-era (33%) and other veterans (30%) reported signs of 
alcohol dependence.  Vietnam-era veterans were also equally likely 
to report alcohol-related physical fights (41%) and binge-drinking 
incidents (46%) as other veterans (40% and 44%, respectively).   
Drunk driving reports were slightly higher among Vietnam-era 
veterans (63%) than other veterans (57%) in State prison.

Similar percentages of combat (28%) and noncombat (31%) veterans 
reported signs of alcohol dependence.  Combat veterans in State 
prison were about as likely to report a prior alcohol-related arrest 
(35%) or a binge-drinking experience (42%) as other veterans (38% and 
45%, respectively).  

Incarcerated veterans and nonveterans 
reported equal participation in substance 
abuse treatment 

Veterans' substance abuse treatment histories were similiar to 
those of other inmates.  Since their admission, veterans in both 
State (34%) and Federal (30%) prisons reported similar levels of 
participation in substance abuse treatment or programs as 
nonveterans (32% and 28%, respectively).  Veterans in local jails 
]also reported the same level of participation as other inmates 
(10% of both) in substance abuse treatment or programs since 
admission. 

Veterans received the same types of treatment as nonveterans.  
Among State prisoners 12% of both groups said they had received 
professional treatment, such as a residential facility or counseling, 
while similar percentages (29% of veterans, 27% of nonveterans) 
reported taking part in programs such as self-help groups and 
education programs.  Veterans (59%) were also as likely as other 
State prisoners (56%) to report participation in substance abuse 
treatment or other programs at some time in their past.   

Incarcerated veterans were more likely 
to report a mental illness

From responses to survey questions regarding their mental health, 
a higher percentage of veterans reported a mental illness than 
nonveteran inmates.   Inmates were considered to be mentally ill 
if they met one of the following two criteria: they reported a 
current mental or emotional condition, or they reported an 
overnight stay in a mental hospital or treatment program.  

The varying rates of mental illness by veteran status were most 
evident in the local jail and Federal prison populations.  Among 
jail inmates, 25% of veterans were identified as mentally ill, 
compared to 15% of nonveterans.  Reports of mental illness were 
much lower in Federal prison, but the percentage of veterans 
reporting an indicator of mental illness (13%) was about twice that 
of nonveterans (6%).  In State prison, the reported rates of mental 
illness among veterans (19%) and nonveterans (16%) were more similar.        

Among State prisoners, veterans who had seen combat duty during 
their service (22%) reported similar rates of mental illness as 
noncombat veterans (19%).  Veterans who served during the Vietnam 
War era were also as likely as other veterans (19% of both) to 
report mental illness.

  Yes                      21.9%

Reported levels of employment and 
income were higher among veteran 
inmates

Prior to their arrest, veteran inmates were more likely to be 
employed than nonveterans.  Veterans in both State prisons (78%) 
and local jails (72%) reported higher levels of employment in the 
month before their arrest than nonveterans (67% and 63%, respectively).  
In particular, veterans (69% of State, 59% of local) were more likely 
to be working full-time prior to their arrest than nonveterans (54% 
of State, 48% of local).  Among Federal prisoners, 72% of both groups 
had been employed prior to their arrest, but a greater share of 
veterans (65%) were employed full-time than nonveterans (59%).
   
The personal income of veterans in the month before their arrest 
was also higher than that of other inmates.  Among State prisoners, 
53% of veterans reported an income of at least $1,000 in the month 
prior to arrest, compared to 41% of nonveterans.  About half of veterans 
in local jails, compared to nearly a third of nonveterans, reported 
an income of at least $1,000. Veterans in both State prison (13%) 
and local jail (16%) were also less likely to report the lowest incomes 
(under $200) than nonveterans (20% and 25%, respectively).  

While overall veterans reported higher incomes, the percentage of 
inmates reporting the highest incomes (at least $5,000) was nearly 
equal for veterans (8% of State, 16% of Federal, and 4% of local) 
and nonveterans (8%, 14%, and 3%, respectively).

Incarcerated veterans were as likely 
as nonveterans to have been 
homeless when arrested

In both State and Federal prisons, as well as local jails, veterans and
nonveterans reported living in similar types of housing prior to their
arrests.  Among State prisoners, about half of both veterans (52%) and
nonveterans (53%) reported living in a house, and about a third of both 
(30% of veterans, 34% of nonveterans) said they had lived in an apartment. 
Similar percentages of veterans and other State prisoners reported 
living in each type of housing prior to their arrest, including other
correctional facilities (2% of each) and group homes or institutions 
(1% of each).

Veterans were no more likely to be homeless at the time of their arrest 
than other inmates.  Among both State (2% of each) and Federal 
(1% of each) prisoners, equal percentages of veterans and nonveterans 
reported living on the street or in a homeless shelter prior to their 
arrest.  The percentage of veterans in prison (12% of State and  6% of
Federal) reporting homelessness in the year prior to arrest was also 
similar to that of nonveterans (10% of State and 4% of Federal).   

Veterans who had not been honorably 
discharged had more serious criminal 
and substance abuse histories

In their current offenses, honorably and not honorably discharged 
veterans in State prison showed few differences. For example, 
nearly equal percentages of honorably (55%) and not honorably (56%) 
discharged veterans were serving a sentence for a violent offense.  In
addition, 35% of both honorable and not honorable discharges were on 
some type of criminal justice status at the time of their current arrest.

Among State prisoners, veterans not honorably discharged reported 
more serious criminal histories than honorably discharged veterans.  
Violent recidivists accounted for 52% of veterans not honorably 
discharged, compared to 42% of honorable discharges.  A higher 
percentage of veterans not honorably discharged (43%) also reported 
at least three prior sentences, compared to those with honorable 
discharges (36%).

Incarcerated veterans not honorably discharged also reported higher 
levels of prior substance abuse.  A majority of these veterans (57%) 
reported drug use in the month before their offense, compared to 43% 
of honorable discharges. About a third (32%) of veterans not honorably
discharged, but nearly a quarter (23%) of honorable discharges, 
reported prior intravenous drug use. Veterans not honorably discharged 
also reported a higher incidence of alcohol dependence (36%) than 
honorable discharges (30%).

While honorably discharged veterans reported lower levels of substance 
abuse, they did report a slightly higher incidence of mental illness 
(19%) than veterans not honorably discharged (16%).

Methodology

Data in this report are based on personal interviews conducted 
through the 1997 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional
Facilities and the 1996 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails.  Detailed
descriptions of the methodology and sample design of each survey 
can be found in the following: Substance Abuse and Treatment, State 
and Federal Prisoners, 1997 (NCJ 172871); and Profile of Jail 
Inmates, 1996 (NCJ 164629).  

Accuracy of the estimates

The accuracy of the estimates in this report depends on two 
types of error: sampling and nonsampling.  Sampling error is 
the variation that may occur by chance because a sample rather 
a complete enumeration of the population was conducted.  Nonsampling 
error can be attributed to many sources, such as nonresponses, 
differences in the interpretation of questions among inmates,
recall difficulties, and processing errors.  The sampling error, 
as measured by an estimated standard error, varies by the size of 
the estimate and the size of the base population.  Estimates of the 
standard errors for selected characteristics have been calculated for 
each survey (see appendix tables).  These standard errors may be used 
to construct confidence intervals around percentages.  For example, 
the 95% confidence interval around the percentage of veterans in State 
prison who were identified as mentally ill is approximately 19.3% plus 
or minus 1.96 times 1.22% (or 21.7% to 16.9%).

These standard errors may also be used to test the statistical 
significance of the difference between two sample statistics by pooling 
the standard errors of the two sample estimates.  For example, the 
standard error of the difference between veterans and other State 
prisoners who used intravenous (IV) drugs would be 1.40% 
(or the square root of the sum of the squared standard errors
for each group).  The 95% confidence interval around the 
difference would be 1.96 times 1.40 (or 2.74%).  Since the difference 
of 5.1% (24.5% minus 19.4%) is greater than 2.74%, the difference 
would be considered statistically significant.

Estimates of the veteran population

This report includes incarceration rates for veterans and nonveterans 
in the U.S. population.  These rates were calculated using projections 
of the veteran population that were generated by the U.S. Department of
Veteran Affairs' National Center for Veteran Analysis and Statistics.  
These veteran population projections are based on 1980 and 1990 decennial
census data on prior military service and discharge data from the U.S.
Department of Defense (DoD).  For more information on the veteran 
population, see K. Sorensen and T. Feild, Statistical  Brief: 
Projections of the U.S. Veteran Population: 1990 to 2010, U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs, May 1994.

Historical statistics on active 
duty military personnel

The DoD annually reports the number of active duty military personnel 
in each branch of service, as well as the DoD total.  For this report 
these historical data were used to calculate the percentage of active 
duty military personnel attributed to each branch of service at the end 
of the fiscal year, 1950 to 1998.  These DoD data are available for the 
years 1950 to 1995 in Table 580, Statistical Abstract of the United 
States, 1998, p. 364.  Data for later years were obtained from the  
following DoD website: http://web1. whs.osd.mil/mmid/military/history/
milhist.htm 

Military prison statistics

In 1994 the DoD Corrections Council established an annual military 
confinement report.  The council, comprised of representatives from 
each branch of military service, adopted a standardized questionnaire 
with a common set of definitions.  With the Corrections Council, the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics produced a series of tables that provide a
unified profile of persons in the custody of U.S. military authorities.  
(For more information, see Correctional Populations in the United States,
1995, NCJ 163916 and Correctional Populations in the United States, 
1996, NCJ 170013.)     

CAGE diagnostic instrument 
for alcohol dependence

The CAGE questionnaire is a diagnostic instrument for detecting a 
person's history of alcohol abuse or dependence.  In a clinical test 
involving hospital admissions, three or more positive responses to 
the four CAGE questions carried a .99 predictive value for alcohol 
abuse or dependence.  For data on the relationship of CAGE to other 
alcohol abuse indicators, see Substance Abuse and Treatment, State 
and Federal Prisoners, 1997, (NCJ 172871).  For further information 
on the predictive values of the CAGE instrument, see the article 
"Screening for Alcohol Abuse Using the CAGE Questionnaire" by B. Bush
and others, The American Journal of Medicine, Vol. 82, February 1987,
pp.231-35.
