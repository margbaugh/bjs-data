Highlights

More than 700 State and local law enforcement
agencies that employed 100 or more full-time
sworn personnel and assigned 50 or more of these
officers to respond to calls for service
provided data in response to the 1999 Law
Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) survey.  Subject areas
covered by the survey include personnel,
community policing,operations, computers and
information systems, and written policies.



Included among these agencies are 487 municipal
police departments, 182 sheriffs' departments
and offices, 31 county police departments, and
the 49 primary State law enforcement agencies
operating in each State except Hawaii.
Collectively, these agencies employed about
402,000 full-time sworn personnel, including
218,000 officers assigned to respond to calls
for service.

Personnel

On average, larger municipal police departments
employed 23 full-time officers per 10,000
residents.  Larger county police and sheriffs'
departments employed an average of 14 and 13
officers per 10,000 residents, respectively. 
Primary State law enforcement agencies employed
an average of 2 officers per 10,000 residents.   

From 1996 to 1999 the median agency increase in
number of full-time sworn personnel was higher
among sheriffs' departments (12%) than for
county (7%), municipal (4%), or State (3%)
police agencies.   

About 9 in 10 sworn personnel in State,
municipal, and county police agencies worked in
field operations.  About 3 in 4 State officers
were regularly assigned to respond to calls for
service compared to about 3 in 5 municipal and
county police officers.  
 
On average, a smaller percentage of sheriffs'
officers worked in field operations (58%) and
responded to calls for service (41%)because more
of these officers were assigned to jail-related
(25%) or court-related (9%) duties.  

Community policing

In 1999, nearly two-thirds of county (66%) and
municipal (62%)police agencies with 100 or more
officers had a formally written community
policing plan, as did nearly half of sheriffs'
departments (46%).   For each type of local
agency, the percentage with a written plan was
higher than in 1997.  In both years, nearly a
third of State police agencies had a written
plan.

Nearly all larger county (97%) and  municipal
(95%) police departments had full-time community
policing officers, as did 88% of sheriffs'
departments.   About half of State police
agencies had them.  For all types of agencies,
these percentages represented substantial
increases over 1997. 

In 1999, larger local law enforcement agencies
had a total of about 59,000 full-time sworn
personnel serving as community policing
officers.   This was about 5 times as many as
was reported in 1997.

In more than four-fifths of county (87%) and
municipal (81%)police departments with 100 or
more officers, all new officer recruits received
community policing training.  This was true in
about three-fifths of sheriffs' departments and
just over half of State police agencies.  For
each type of agency, these percentages were
higher than in 1997. 

A large majority of the municipal police (92%),
sheriffs' (82%),and county police (79%)
departments trained at least some of their
in-service officers in community policing.  Most
State police agencies (62%) did so as well.  For
municipal police, sheriffs' departments,  and
State police agencies these percentages were
higher than in 1997.

During the 12-month period ending June 30, 1999,
a majority of local law enforcement agencies
with 100 or more officers trained citizens in
community policing (72%), formed problem-solving
partnerships through written agreements (60%),
and actively encouraged patrol officers to
become involved in problem-solving projects that
utilized community policing concepts (64%).

Nearly all larger local law enforcement agencies
met with community groups during the 12-month
period ending June 30, 1999, as did 78% of State
agencies.  Local police agencies were most
likely to meet with neighborhood associations
(96%), school groups (88%), and business groups
(84%).  

During the 12-month period ending June 30,1999,
most larger local law enforcement agencies
surveyed citizens (57%) on issues such as their
satisfaction with police services (51%) and
their perceptions of crime problems (45%).  

About a third of State and local law enforcement
agencies with 100 or more officers provided
citizens with routine access to crime statistics
or crime maps over the Internet, more than twice
the proportion that did so in 1997.

Operations

From 1997 to 1999, the percentage of larger
local law enforcement agencies using routine
bicycle patrol increased from 62% to 79%, and
the percentage using foot patrol units on a
routine basis increased from 44% to 62%. 

Almost all of the Nation's larger county  police
(97%), municipal police (94%), and sheriffs'
(90%) departments participated in an enhanced
9-1-1 system in 1999, as did about half of State
agencies.  From 1997 to 1999, the percentage of
larger local law enforcement agencies with
enhanced 9-1-1 increased from 83% to 93%.  

Nearly all local law enforcement agencies with
100 or more officers were responsible for
investigating serious violent and property
crimes occurring in their jurisdiction, as were
about half of State agencies.  Local agencies
were more likely than State agencies to be the
lead investigative agency for computer-related
(74% versus 43%), and environmental (39% versus
22%) crimes.

About half of State agencies performed
investigative support functions such as
fingerprint processing (55%), crime lab
services (53%), and ballistics testing (43%). 
Local agencies were more likely than State
agencies to handle fingerprint processing (81%),
but less likely to provide crime lab services
(38%) or ballistics testing (16%).

Nearly all State and local agencies with 100 or
more officers were responsible for traffic law
enforcement and accident investigation.  About
four-fifths had traffic direction and control
duties.  A majority of local agencies were
responsible for parking enforcement (77%) and
school crossing (60%) services.

Most State (73%) and local (87%) agencies with
100 or more officers performed special weapons
and tactics (SWAT) operations.   A majority of
sheriffs' (76%) and county (58%)police
departments also handled search and rescue
operations. County police (61%) were the most
likely to handle bomb disposal, although about
half of State police and sheriffs' departments
performed this function as well.  

Nearly all sheriffs' departments and offices
with 100 or more officers performed
court-related functions such as executing
arrest warrants, providing court security and
serving civil process.  Ninety percent of these
agencies also operated at least one jail.

Nearly 4 in 5 State and local law enforcement
agencies dispatched calls for service, and a
majority of State (82%) and county (68%) police
agencies operated a training academy.  

Computers and information systems 

More than 90% of State police agencies used some
type of mobile computer or  terminal in 1999, as
did 76% of larger local law enforcement
agencies.  These percentages were similar to
those reported in 1997.

From 1997 to 1999, the percentage of State and
local agencies employing 100 or more officers
that provided in-field computer access to prior
calls for service information, criminal
histories, driving records, and vehicle records
increased slightly.  In 1999 more than half of
these agencies provided at least some patrol
officers with direct access via in-field
computer to information on wanted suspects and
driving records. 

In 1999, 82% of the Nation's larger State and
local law enforcement agencies primarily used
paper reports to transmit field report data to
their central information system, down from
86% in 1997.  Alternative methods included the
use of telephone lines, computer media, data
devices, and wireless transmission. 

A higher percentage of larger local law
enforcement agencies were using computerized
geocoding and mapping data in 1999 than
in 1997.  Increases were reported in the use of
geocoding and mapping of data for crime
incidents (from 49% to 64%), calls for
service (44% to 57%), and arrests (36% to 45%). 

Increased use of computerized formats for
information storage was observed in 1999
compared with 1997.   Increases among local
agencies by information type included alarms
(87% in 1999, 74% in 1997); arrests (98%, 93%);
criminal histories (83%, 78%); evidence (89%,
81%); field interviews (75%, 66%); incident
reports (93%, 88%); stolen property (87%, 75%);
traffic accidents (82%, 73%); traffic citations
(77%, 67%); vehicle registration (47%, 30%;
warrants (85%, 77%). 

Written policy directives

For most subject areas covered by the LEMAS 
survey, a higher percentage of agencies had a
written policy covering that topic in 1999 than
in 1997.  For example, 86% of local agencies had
a written policy covering discretionary arrest
power in 1999 compared to 73% in 1997; and 90%
had a policy on maximum work hours allowed for
officers in 1999 compared to 68% in 1997.


Foreword

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) began the
Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) program in 1987 with a
nationwide survey of State and local law
enforcement agencies.  Updated versions of the
survey were completed in 1990, 1993, and 1997. 
The current volume presents 1999 data
provided by 700 local and 49 State local law
enforcement agencies employing 100 or more
full-time officers. Data on personnel,
operations, computers and information systems,
and written policies are presented.  

As in 1997, this volume also includes a
community policing section based on survey
questions developed by the Office of Community
Oriented Policing Services (COPS).  An outgrowth
of the ongoing collaboration between BJS and
COPS, the 1999 LEMAS survey is expected to be
instrumental in assessing the state of
law enforcement, specifically community
policing, in the United States.  Funding for its
administration was provided by COPS.

Since the advent of the 1994 Violent Crime Act,
COPS has been tasked with funding 100,000 new
officers by the year 2000 and advancing
community policing nationwide.  Towards this
end, the COPS Office created numerous grant
programs to hire additional police officers and
to promote the practice of community policing. 
The inclusion of community policing questions in
the 1997 and 1999 LEMAS surveys is but one step
in assessing the potential impact these programs
have on law enforcement agencies across the
country.

We are pleased to present the results of the
1999 LEMAS survey, and are confident that the
information gleaned from these data will help
further our knowledge of law enforcement as it
exists today.  We hope the results of the survey
will provide law enforcement agencies an
opportunity to assess their progress in
community policing relative to that of
comparable jurisdictions. In closing, we
gratefully acknowledge the participation of
those agencies that have given us a glimpse into
their law enforcement practices and hope that
this information will be of use to them
and the communities they serve.

Introduction

The 1999 Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey
included all State and local agencies
employing 100 or more full-time sworn personnel
as reported in a BJS census of State and local
law enforcement agencies conducted in 1996.  The
survey also included a nationally representative
sample of agencies that employed fewer than 100
officers.  These smaller agencies are covered in
separate BJS reports.

The 1999 LEMAS questionnaire was mailed to the
same agencies that received the 1997 version. 
The initial mailing of the 1999 form was
conducted in July 1999.  The reference date for
all personnel-related questions was the pay
period that included June 30, 1999.  For other
questions it was June 30, 1999 unless otherwise
indicated.  The data were collected by the
Bureau of the Census for BJS.

A total of 3,319 agencies received the 1999
LEMAS questionnaire,and 3,246 (97.8%) responded. 
Of the 895 agencies with 100 or more officers
that received the survey, 883 (98.6%) responded.
This was the fifth survey in the LEMAS program
with previous data collections occurring in
1987, 1990, 1993, and 1997.  

Overview of this volume

This volume presents individual agency data for
749 larger State and local law enforcement
agencies that responded to the 1999 LEMAS
survey.  Agencies with special geographic
jurisdictions such as university campuses,
public school districts, transportation systems,
parks and recreation facilities, airports,
waterways, public housing, or State government
buildings are excluded.  Agencies with special
enforcement responsibilities such as natural
resource and conservation laws, alcohol control
laws, or agricultural laws are also excluded. 

The volume includes the 49 primary State law
enforcement agencies operating in each State
except Hawaii.  (The Hawaii Department of Public
Safety primarily performs court-related duties).

General purpose local law enforcement agencies
that responded to the LEMAS survey are included
as long as they met the following
criteria: 

     1.  Employment of 100 or more full-time
sworn officers as of June 1996 (reference month
for the 1996 agency census).
     2.  Employment of 100 or more full-time
sworn officers as of June 1999 (reference month
for the 1999 LEMAS survey.
     3.  Employment of 50 or more full-time
uniformed sworn officers with regular assigned
duties that included responding to calls for
service as of June 1999.

A total of 700 local law enforcement agencies
are included. This includes 31 county police
departments, 487 municipal police departments,
and 182 sheriffs' departments and offices. 
Local agencies from every State except North
Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming are included. 
These States had no local agencies that
met the above requirements for inclusion.   

Organization of data tables 

A summary of the number and type of agencies
from each State is in table A.

Table B lists the local law enforcement agencies
employing 1,000 or more full-time sworn
personnel that included 500 or more uniformed
officers whose regular assigned duties included
responding to calls for service.  These are the
agencies with the largest number of sworn
personnel providing direct law enforcement
services.

Table C presents summary data, by type of
agency, for the variables that are included in
the individual agency tables that follow.  The
reader should refer to the notes in the
corresponding individual data agency tables when
using data from table C.

Following the 3 summary data tables are tables
containing individual data for State and local
law enforcement agencies with 100 or more
officers.  The 19 tables for local agencies are
presented first as tables 1a through 19a. 
Following the local agency tables are tables 1b
through 19b covering the State agencies.  

Local agencies are listed alphabetically by
State and county. Within each county, the county
sheriffs' department or county police department
is listed first, if applicable.  These are
followed, in alphabetical order, by the
municipal police agencies operating within that
county.  

The reader should refer to the note following
each table for the explanation of symbols and
codes as well as other important information.  
A triple dash ("---") is used in all tables to
indicate that a particular data item was not
provided by an agency.
