On June 29, 2001, a total of 68 jails, 
confinement facilities, detention centers, 
or other correctional facilities were super-
vising 2,030 persons in Indian country, an 
increase of 10% from the previous year. 
At midyear 2000, 1,853 persons were under 
the supervision of jails in Indian country.

Indian country facilities held in custody
1,912 inmates at midyear 2001, up from
1,775 at midyear 2000. Jail authorities also
supervised 118 offenders under community
supervision programs.  New admissions to
jail increased from 7,151 in June 2000 to
9,697 in June 2001, a 36% increase.  

The 68 facilities had a rated capacity to
hold 2,101 persons, up 1% since 2000. On
June 29, 2001, the jails were operating at
91% of capacity, up from 86% at midyear
2000.  On their peak day in June 2001, the
68 jails were operating at 126% of capacity,
up from 118% in 2000.  The number of inmates 
in custody on the peak day in June has 
increased 15% since 1998.  Sixteen jails 
indicated plans that will increase capacity 
by 623 beds when all changes have been 
completed.  

These data are based on the 2001 Survey
of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC).  The
survey includes all jails, confinement
facilities, detention centers, and other
correctional facilities located in Indian
country and operated by tribal authorities 
or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). The
survey gathers information on the number
of persons in custody, the number under 
community supervision, offender
characteristics, and facility capacity.  

Tribes retain jurisdiction over many
crimes by American Indians and Alaska 
Natives in Indian country

Thirty-three States contain around 300
Indian land areas or reservations. 
Generally, the local governing authority 
on Indian lands is a tribal government 
or council.  Jurisdiction over crimes in 
Indian country depends on several factors,
including the identity of the victim and 
the offender, the severity of the crime, 
and where the crime was committed. (See 
box on this page.)  Tribal authority to 
sentence offenders is limited to 1 year 
of imprisonment and a $5,000 fine or both 
(25 U.S.C. sec. 1302(7)). 

Locally-operated city or county jails held
over 3 times as many American Indians as
jails in Indian country. (American Indians 
in this report includes Alaska Natives.)  
At midyear 2001, local jails held an 
estimated 6,000 American Indians, some of 
whom may have been adjudicated by a tribal
criminal justice system and housed in 
jails under contract with tribal governments. 
Overall, State, Federal, local, and tribal
authorities were supervising 49,673 American 
Indians. Most were under community supervision 
(28,387).

A total of 21,286, American Indians were in
custody at midyear 2001, most of whom were 
held in State prison (11,419).

On April 1, 2000, 2,475,956 American
Indians and Alaska Natives lived in the
Unites States (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000
Census of Population and Housing, Table
DP-1).  American Indians account for under
1% of the U.S. resident population and
around 1% of those in custody of jails or
prisons.

At midyear 2001, the rate of incarceration
for American Indians was about 19% higher 
than the overall national rate. Federal and 
State prison and jail authorities held 849 
American Indians per 100,000 Indians, 
compared to 690 persons of all races per 
100,000 U.S. residents.

Indian country jail population 
rose 8%

At midyear 2001, jails in Indian country
supervised 2,030 persons, up from 1,853 in
2000. Nearly all (1,912) were held in jails,
with an additional 118 persons being
supervised in the community. The number
of inmates in custody increased 8% from
the previous year, when 1,775 inmates
were being housed.  Persons under
community supervision  increased 51%
(118 in 2001 compared to 78 in 2000).  
The number of persons required to perform
community service rose from 18 in 2000 to
39 in 2001.  Persons sentenced to day
reporting increased from 3 in 2000 to 21 
in 2001.

a table).

Nearly half of inmate population 
held in 10 jails

On June 29, 2001, the largest 10 jails in
Indian country housed 878 inmates. 
Combined, the 10 facilities had a rated
capacity to hold 617 inmates, or  29% of
the total rated capacity of all facilities 
in Indian country.  Sixty-seven percent (584)
of the inmates in the 10 largest jails were
confined in 7 facilities in Arizona.

(15) operating above 150% of capacity on
their most crowded day in June since
introducing the survey in 1998.  Arizona 
(6) had the most facilities above 150% of
capacity, followed by Montana (4), New
Mexico (4), South Dakota (4), North Dakota
(2), and Oregon (1).

Pine Ridge Correctional Facility in South
Dakota reported the highest occupancy
rate on their peak day in June (764%), up
from 391% in 2000.  It housed 168 inmates
on the peak day in day in June 2001, with 
a rated capacity to hold 22 inmates. Three
other facilities reported operating at over
300%:  Medicine Root Detention Center in
South Dakota (333%), Tohono O'odham
Detention Center in Arizona (329%), and
Fort Belknap Police Department in Montana 
(325%).

Small facilities reported the

Seven facilities with a rated capacity to
hold fewer than 10 inmates reported the
highest occupancy rates (173%) on their
peak day in June 2001.  Occupancy was
168% of rated capacity in jails rated to 
hold 10 to 24 inmates, 127% in jails rated 
to hold 25 to 49, and 99% of  capacity for
those rated to hold 50 or more inmates.

Facilities under court order or consent
decree highest  in 3 years

Thirteen jails were under court order or
consent decree to limit the number of
inmates they can house, up from 11 in
2000. Ten of those facilities were under
multiple court orders or consent decrees. 
Sixteen jails expect to increase capacity 
by 623 beds when all planned changes have
been completed.

Nine new jails will be added to Indian
country, five facilities will be replaced, 
and one will be expanded.

These plans have been funded under the
Correctional Facilities on Tribal Lands
Discretionary Grant Program, which is
administered by the U.S. Department of
Justice, Office of Justice Programs.  In
addition, 17 jails report plans for facility
changes in the next 3 years that have final
administrative approval, even though
necessary funds have not been authorized.

Methodology

"Indian country" is a statutory term that
includes the following:  all lands within an
Indian reservation; dependent Indian
communities; and Indian trust allotments
(18 U.S.C. sec. 1151).  Courts interpret
sec. 1151 to include all lands held in trust
for tribes or their members.  See United
States v. Roberts. 185 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir.
1999).  Tribal authority to imprison Indian
offenders is limited to 1 year per offense 
by statute (25 U.S.C. sec. 1302).

Tribal law enforcement agencies act as first
responders to both felony and misdemeanor 
crimes.  For most of Indian country, the 
Federal Government provides felony law 
enforcement concerning crimes by or against 
Indians.  Certain areas of Indian country are 
under Public Law 83-280, as amended. P.L. 
280 conferred jurisdiction on certain States 
over "Indian country" and suspended enforcement 
of the Major Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. sec. 1153)
and the General Crimes Act (18 U.S.C.
sec. 1152) in those areas.  Indian tribes
retain concurrent jurisdiction to enforce
laws in Indian country where P.L. 280
applies.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS)
conducted the Survey of Jails in Indian
Country (SJIC) to describe all adult and
juvenile jail facilities and detention 
centers in Indian country.  For purposes 
of this report, Indian country includes
reservations, pueblos, rancherias, and
other appropriate areas (18 U.S.C. sec.
1151). The reference date for the survey
was June 29, 2001.  

The SJIC was initiated in 1998 as a
component of the Annual Survey of Jails
(ASJ). The ASJ is conducted in each of
the years between the Census of Jails. 
The 2001 ASJ consisted of a sample survey 
of 878 local jail jurisdictions, a survey 
of the Nation's 47 multi-jurisdictional
facilities, and a survey of the 68 
facilities in Indian country. (For sampling 
information, see Prison and Jails Inmates 
at Midyear 2001, BJS Bulletin, April 2002, 
NCJ 191702.)

In 1998 the Office of Law Enforcement
Services, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA),
U.S. Department of the Interior, provided 
a complete list of 74 Indian country jail
facilities.  The list included detention
centers, jails, and other correctional
facilities, operated by tribal authorities 
or the BIA.  Since 1998, 2 facilities were
abandoned, 3 were closed, and 2 were
combined into 1 facility, resulting in 68
surveyed facilities.  The facilities are 
in 18 States and are affiliated with 53 
tribes.  

Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires.  
Through follow-up phone calls and facsimiles, 
the survey achieved a 100% response rate. In 
addition, construction plans for facilities 
funded under the Correctional Facilities on 
Tribal Lands Discretionary Grant Program 
were obtained from the Corrections Program
Office, Office of Justice Programs.
