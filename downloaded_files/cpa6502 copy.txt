According to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), persons age 65 
or older generally experienced victimizations at much lower rates than younger
groups of people from 1993 through 2002.  

For the period 1993-2002 the elderly experienced nonfatal violent crime at a
rate 1/20th that of young persons (4 per 1,000 age 65 or older versus 82
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12-24). Violent crimes include rape,
sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assaults.

Households headed by persons age 65 or older experienced property crimes at 
a rate about a fourth of that for households headed by persons under age 25
(93 per 1,000 households versus 406 per 1,000).

Purse snatching/pocket picking (personal larceny) was the only measured crime
for which the elderly were victimized at about the same rates as most other
age groups. Persons age 12-24 were the only group with higher rates of
personal larceny than the elderly.

Although persons age 65 or older generally experienced lower victimization
rates, when they were victimized they were most often the victims of property
crimes, which include household burglary, motor vehicle theft and theft.
Property crimes accounted for 92% of victimizations affecting persons or
households headed by someone 65 or older and 88% of victimizations against
persons or households headed by persons age 50-64. In comparison, violent
crimes comprised more than half the victimizations experienced by persons 
age 12-24.

Compared to younger victims of personal crimes (rape/sexual assault, robbery,
assault, and purse snatching/pocket picking), elderly victims were
disproportionately victimized by thefts of their purses or wallets About 1 in
5 of personal crimes against the elderly were thefts compared to about 1 in 33
for persons age 12-49.

Trends in violent and property crimes, 1993-2002

Nonfatal violence generally declined for most age groups between 1993 and
2002. The elderly had the lowest rates of any age group for nonfatal violence
during this period. In recent years all rates have remained stable, after
declining in earlier years. Rates for persons age 50-64 were stable during
some of the years in which there were declines for younger age groups.

Murder, which is measured by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform
Crime Reports, declined slightly for the elderly between 1993 and 1998.
Since 1998 murder rates have remained stable for this age group. Persons age
65 or older had lower rates of murder than other age groups every year 
between 1993 and 2002. 

Property crime victimizations declined for households headed by all age
groups between 1993 and 2002. For persons age 65 or older, property crime
rates in 2002 were less than half that of the rates in 1993 (63 per 1,000
households versus 133 per 1,000).

Violent victimization characteristics, 1993-2002

Compared to younger persons, the elderly are less likely to be victims of
violence, but when victimized, persons age 65 or older  --
*  were equally likely to face offenders with weapons (30% versus 26%)
*  were more likely to offer no resistance (45% versus 29%)
*  were equally likely to receive serious injuries (3% for both groups).

Offenders in violent crimes, 1993-2002

Persons age 65 or older, when compared with those age 12-64, --
*  were somewhat more likely to face offenders who were strangers to
them (53% versus 46%)
*  were more likely to face offenders age 30 or older (48% versus 30%)
*  were equally likely to face male offenders (about 79% versus 76%).

When and where crimes occurred and reporting 
of crimes to police 

Lower percentages of crimes against persons age 65 or older were committed 
at night compared to crimes against younger persons. About a fourth of 
violent crimes against the elderly were committed at night, compared to 
almost half of all violence against persons age 12-64. Similar differences
existed for personal larceny (15% versus 34%) and property crime (21% versus
29%).

About 46% of violent crimes and about 67% of property crimes against persons
or households headed by persons age 65 or older occurred at or near their
homes. The elderly were more likely than those age 12-64 to face these crimes
while in or near their homes. Purse snatching/pocket picking rarely occurred
near home for either persons age 65 or older or those under age 65 (5% versus
6%).

Compared to younger victims, persons age 65 or older were more likely to
report violence (53% versus 44%) and purse snatching/pocket picking
(42% versus 32%) to the police. Slightly over a third of all households,
regardless of the age of the household head, reported property crimes.

Methodology

This report presents data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).
This survey obtains information about criminal victimizations and incidents
from an ongoing, nationally representative sample of households in the United
States. 

Information about murder was obtained from the Uniform Crime Reports sponsored
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Data were obtained from Supplemental
Homicide Reports covering the period of 1993 through 2002.

Some crimes of concern are not within the scope of the NCVS. The NCVS is a
household-based survey. It does not interview persons living in institutions,
so that it cannot measure victimization of the elderly who reside in such
settings. The NCVS does not measure most types of fraud. Questions concerning
identity theft were added to the questionnaire in July 2004 and Will be
analyzed in future reports when data become available.

NCVS data are useful for providing a comprehensive overview of the entire
elderly population within the United States. Within this population, however,
there are people with particular vulnerabilities whose victimization may be
under reported or outside of the scope of the crimes measured by this survey.
Other types of studies targeted at specific groups, such as elderly people 
in nursing homes, are needed to complement the data available through NCVS.

Computation of standard errors

The comparisons made in this report were tested to determine whether the
observed differences between groups were statistically significant. Except
where otherwise noted comparisons mentioned in this report passed a 
hypothesis test at the .05 level of statistical significance (or the 95%
confidence level).

One should use caution when comparing estimates not discussed in the text. 
Seemingly large differences may not be statistically significant at the 95% 
or even the 90% confidence level.
