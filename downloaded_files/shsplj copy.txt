Highlights
                
State prison, local jail suicide rates 
have fallen sharply since the 1980's
     
*  In 2002 the suicide rate in local jails (47 per 
100,000 inmates) was over 3 times the rate in State 
prisons (14 per 100,000 inmates).

*  The suicide rate in the Nation's 50 largest jail
systems (29 per  100,000 inmates) was half that of
other jails (57 per 100,000).

*  Violent offenders in both local jails (92 per 
100,000)and State prisons (19 per 100,000) had 
suicide rates over twice as high as those of 
nonviolent offenders (31 and 9 per 100,000 
respectively).

Homicide rates in State prisons dropped
93% from 1980 to 2002

*  Homicide rates were similar in local jails (3 per
100,000) and State prisons (4 per 100,000).

*  67% of homicide victims in State prisons had served
at least 2 years; 37% had served 5 years.

*  Violent offenders were the victims of most State
prison homicides (61%), and their jail homicide rate 
(5 per 100,000) was over twice that of nonviolent 
offenders (2 per 100,000).
------------------------------------------------

Data from new Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) data
collections offer the first opportunity to analyze the
personal characteristics, current offenses, and
environmental factors surrounding inmate deaths in
local jails and State prisons nationwide.

To implement the Death in Custody Reporting Act of
2000 (PL 106-297), BJS began collecting inmate death
records from all local jails in 2000 and expanded
reporting to include State prisons in 2001. In this 
first report from the Deaths in Custody Reporting 
Program, data from 2000 to 2002 highlight inmate and 
facility characteristics related to high risks of 
suicide and homicide.  

Jail suicide rates declined steadily from 129 per 
100,000 inmates in 1983 to 47 per 100,000 in 2002. 
In 1983 suicide accounted for the majority of jail 
deaths (56%), but by 2002, the most common cause of 
jail deaths was natural causes (including AIDS)(52%), 
well ahead of suicides (32%). Suicide rates in State 
prison fell from 34 per 100,000 in 1980 to 16 per 
100,000 in 1990, and have since stabilized.

State prison homicide rates dipped sharply from 1980
(54 per 100,000) to 1990 (8 per 100,000). By 2002
prison homicide rates had declined further, down to 4
per 100,000. Homicide rates in local jails were more
stable, declining slightly from 5 per 100,000 in 1983 
to 3 per 100,000 in 2002.

------------------------------------------
The Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 

The passage of the Death in Custody Reporting Act 
of 2000 (DICRA, PL 106-297) dramatically altered
programs collecting data on inmate deaths. Prior 
to the act, BJS conducted annual counts of State
prisoner deaths. Counts of jail inmate deaths were
collected in the Census of Jails, which is conducted
every 5 or 6 years. For both populations, death 
counts were obtained by gender and by general cause
categories, such as illness/natural causes, AIDS,
suicide, and homicide. These aggregate counts of
deaths did not allow for analysis of individual 
death cases.

DICRA was attached as a grant requirement of the
Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing
(VOI/TIS) incentive grant program. Beginning in 1996,
these grants provided over $2.5 billion to all 50 States
and U.S. Territories for expanding prison capacity to
house violent offenders for longer periods. Each State
receiving VOI/TIS funds was required under DICRA to
report:

"on a quarterly basis, information regarding the death 
of any person who is in the process of arrest, is en 
route to be incarcerated, or is incarcerated at a
municipal or county jail, State prison, or other local 
or State correctional facility (including any juvenile 
facility) that, at a minimum, includes  --
(A) the name, gender, race, ethnicity, and age of 
the deceased; 
(B) the date, time, and location of death; and 
(C) a brief description of the circumstances 
surrounding the death."

BJS developed a new series of collections to meet the
mandates of the act. Aggregate counts of deaths were
replaced by detailed, individual inmate death records,
collected every 3 months from over 3,000 jail
jurisdictions, 50 State prison systems, juvenile
correctional authorities in all 50 States, and roughly
18,000 State and local law enforcement agencies
nationwide. These new data collections were phased in
over 4 years, with local jails reporting in 2000, 
followed by State prisons in 2001 and State juvenile 
authorities in 2002. A network of statewide law 
enforcement reporters began submitting arrest-related 
death records to BJS in 2003.

With these new collections, BJS has enhanced both the
frequency and scope of its data on inmate mortality. 
Among other improvements, BJS now collects information 
on specific medical causes of death, as determined by 
a coroner or medical examiner. BJS replaced a general 
category of "illness/natural causes," with specific 
categories of medical conditions related to mortality, 
such as cancer, heart disease, and hepatitis C. A 
detailed analysis of these fatal medical conditions
will be the focus of the next report from this data
collection series.

--------------------------------------------------
Long term trends show sleep declines in rates of State
prisoner homicide and local jail inmates suicide

Over the past two decades, State prison and local jail
inmate mortality rates have displayed some dynamic
changes. Suicide was the leading cause of death among
jail inmates in 1983 (129 per 100,000 inmates); by 1993
that rate had been cut by more than half (54 per 100,000
inmates), and illness/natural cause (67 per 100,000) 
had become the most common cause of jail deaths. By 2002
the jail suicide rate (47 per 100,000) had fallen to 
nearly a third of the 1983 rate. Rates of death from
AIDS-related causes in jails also declined; the 2002 
rate (8 per 100,000) was less than half of the 1988 rate 
(20 per 100,000). As a result of these reductions, the 
overall mortality rate in local jails dropped 37% 
between 1983 and 2002.

State prison suicide rates have historically been much
lower than those of jails, but these also dropped 
sharply from 34 per 100,000 in 1980 to 14 per 100,000 
inmates in 2002. Even more dramatic was the decline in
homicide deaths, from 54 per 100,000 inmates in 1980
to 8 per 100,000 inmates in 1990, and to 4 per 100,000
inmates in 2002. With the introduction of new therapies
during the 1990's, AIDS-related mortality rates in State
prison fell rapidly from 100 per 100,000 inmates in 1995
to 15 per 100,000 inmates 5 years later. Overall State
prisoner mortality rates have grown slightly (6%) since
1980, mostly due to illness/natural causes (up 
40% since 1980).
------------------------------------------

Nationwide, 337 State prisoners 
committed suicide during 2001-02

Suicide and homicide accounted for a combined 7% 
of all State prisoner deaths during 2001-02. The 
average annual suicide rate of State prisoners 
(14 suicides per 100,000 prisoners) was a third 
of that of local jail inmates (48).  

Prison suicide rates showed wide variation at the 
State level. New Hampshire, Nebraska, and North
Dakota all reported no suicide deaths during the 
2-year period. Another six States had suicide rates 
of 5 per 100,000 prisoners or lower. Thirteen 
States had suicide rates of at least 25 per 100,000 
prisoners, led by South Dakota (71), Utah (49), 
Vermont, Alaska, and Arkansas (each with 36).

In most State prison systems, suicides were rare 
events. Only 9 States reported as many as 10 
prisoner suicides during this period, with 42% of 
all suicides taking place in four States. California 
(52), Texas (49), New York (21), and Illinois (20) 
reported 142 of the Nation's 337 State prisoner 
suicides. About half of all States (24)recorded 3 
or fewer suicides. 

87 State prisoners became victims 
of homicide over 2 years

Most States did not have any prisoner homicides in 
the course of a year.  During 2001, 31 States 
reported no prison homicides; 29 States did not 
report a homicide during 2002. Three States reported 
43% of all homicides -- California (21), Texas (10), 
and Maryland (6). No other State reported more than 
5 homicides during 2001-02.

Homicide rates were low in most States, and 5 had 
a rate of at least 10 homicides per 100,000 
prisoners, led by South Dakota (34) and New Mexico 
(17). However, even in these 5 States, a combined 
total of 13 homicides were reported over 2 years.

Suicide rate in the Nation's 50 
largest jail jurisdictions half 
that of all other jails

There are over 3,300 local jails operated by county 
and municipal jurisdictions nationwide. Jails typically
hold unsentenced offenders, those sentenced to less
than a year, and offenders sentenced to longer terms
who are awaiting transfer to State prison. As a result,
almost every State prisoner has been through a period
of jail confinement.

Over a 3-year period (2000-02), the Nation's 50 largest
jail jurisdictions reported a total of 1,037 
deaths from all causes. This death count 
represented a higher overall mortality rate (167 
per 100,000 inmates in the average daily 
population) than other jails (140 per 100,000).  

Mortality rates varied widely among the top 50
jurisdictions. Twelve of these 50 jurisdictions 
had overall mortality rates of fewer than 100 
deaths per 100,000 inmates, led by Suffolk County, 
Massachusetts (29), Orange County, California (42), 
and Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (52). 
Another 16 of the top 50 jurisdictions had rates of 
200 or more deaths per 100,000 inmates, led by 
Baltimore City, Maryland (381), Jacksonville City, 
Florida (341), and Davidson County, Tennessee (291).

The 50 largest jail jurisdictions collectively had 
a comparatively low prevalence of suicide. Inmate
suicides accounted for 17% of all deaths in these 50
largest jurisdictions but were the cause of 41% of 
the deaths in all other jails. The suicide rate of 
the 50 largest jurisdictions (29 per 100,000) was 
half that of all other jails (57).

Eight of the top 50 jurisdictions reported no suicides
during 2000-02, and another 4 jurisdictions had a
suicide rate of 10 per 100,000 or less. Ten of these
jurisdictions also had suicide rates of at least 50 
per 100,000 inmates, led by Clark County, Nevada 
(107), Wayne County, Michigan (97), and Baltimore 
City, Maryland (88).

During 2002 the Nation's smallest jails had 
a suicide rate 5 times that of the largest 
jails 

On an average day in 2002, over 40% of the nation's
jails housed fewer than 50 inmates, while 2% of all 
jails held at least 1,500 inmates. Rates of inmate 
suicide were closely related to jail size, with the 
smallest facilities recording the highest suicide 
rates.  

The Nation's largest jail facilities recorded the 
lowest suicide rates (32 per 100,000 inmates). The 
suicide rate rose steadily as jail size decreased and 
was over 5 times higher (177 per 100,000) in jails 
holding fewer than 50 inmates. However, given their 
small populations, these jails accounted for 14% of 
all jail suicides.

Jail suicide rates drop by over 90% 
when based on "at-risk" population 

BJS has usually based jail mortality rates on the 
average daily population  of inmates (an ADP of 
under 700,000). A more sensitive measure of jail 
mortality would reflect the far larger number of 
persons admitted into these facilities over the 
entire year (nearly 13 million). All of these 
persons admitted are at risk of dying while held 
in jail. 
 
Past attempts to collect admission data for a whole 
year were unsuccessful, because many jail information
systems do not keep cumulative counts of admissions.
As part of the new Deaths in Custody records, BJS
collected annual admission data, which can be used 
to calculate an at-risk measure of mortality for the 
Nation's largest jails.

While the 50 jurisdictions had an average daily
population of 207,471 over the 3-year period, these
same jails had an average of 2,827,133 admissions
each year. As a result, the at-risk mortality rates 
of these jurisdictions are far lower. The ADP rate 
of overall mortality in the top 50 jurisdictions 
(167 per 100,000)was 15 times the at-risk rate(11). 
The ADP-based suicide rate for these 50 jurisdictions 
(29 per 100,000)was 14 times the at-risk suicide rate 
for these facilities (2 per 100,000).

Males and white inmates had the highest 
rates of suicide in jails

Among local jail inmates, mortality rates varied 
across demographic subgroups. In terms of deaths from 
all causes, male inmates had a higher death rate 
(150 per 100,000 inmates) than females (130). Gender 
was a stronger factor in suicide rates: males (50 per 
100,000)were 56% more likely to commit suicide than 
female jail inmates (32). The homicide rate of male 
jail inmates was low (3 per 100,000) and female 
inmates did not experience a single homicide during 
2000-02. 
 
The most common cause of death among jail inmates
was illness (48% of all jail deaths during 2000-02). 
As a result, the overall mortality rates of jail 
inmates steadily rose with age. Among jail inmates age 
18-24, the mortality rate was 60 per 100,000; this rate 
was 3 times higher for inmates age 35-44 (179), and 
over 11 times higher for inmates age 55 or older (694). 
The only exception to this pattern was the death rate 
of jail inmates under age 18 (138 per 100,000), who 
made up less than 2% of all jail deaths.

Jail suicide rates also increased with inmate age.
Inmates age 18-24 were the least likely to commit
suicide (38 suicides per 100,000 inmates); this rate
increased 24% for inmates age 25-34 (47), and 39% for
inmates age 35-44 (53). The oldest inmates, age 55 or
older, had the highest rate of suicide (58 per 100,000)
among adult inmates. 

The youngest jail inmates were the exception to this
pattern; jail inmates under 18 had the highest suicide
rate in local jails (101 per 100,000). Given their 
relatively small numbers, inmates under the age of 
18 committed 35 of the 918 jail suicides recorded 
nationwide over 3 years. 

Inmate age did not have any clear relationship to 
jail homicide rates, which were no higher than 7 
per 100,000 inmates for all age groups. Both the 
youngest (under 18) and oldest (55 or older)
inmates had no homicide deaths during 2000-02.  

White jail inmates 6 times more 
likely to commit suicide than black 
inmates and 3 times more likely than 
Hispanic inmates

Mortality rates displayed substantial differences 
by race and ethnicity. Death rates from all causes 
for both black (118 per 100,000 inmates) and Hispanic 
(98) jail inmates were at least 20% below the overall 
jail inmate mortality rate (148). But the death 
rate of white jail inmates (219 per 100,000) was 86% 
higher than that of black inmates and over twice as 
high as the rate for Hispanic inmates.  

Differences across racial/ethnic categories were more
pronounced in jail inmate suicide rates. The suicide
rate of white jail inmates (96 per 100,000 inmates) 
was more than triple that of Hispanic inmates(30) and
was 6 times the suicide rate for black inmates(16).
White inmates accounted for nearly three-quarters of 
all jail inmate suicides during 2000-02.

Unlike the overall mortality and suicide rates, 
homicide rates were not related to race/ethnicity. 
White, black and Hispanic jail inmates were all 
equally likely to be victims of a homicide (3 
deaths per 100,000 inmates).

State prisoners age 45 or older made 
up 17% of inmates but 66% of deaths

Just as in local jails, male State prisoners had 
higher overall mortality rates than female prisoners. 
While this difference was modest in local jails(the 
male death rate was 15% higher), males (251 deaths 
per 100,000 prisoners) were 79% more likely than 
females (140)to die in State prison during 2001-02.

In contrast, male and female suicide rates in State
prisons were similar (14 suicides per 100,000 males,
compared to 10 per 100,000 females). In local jails 
men were over 50% more likely than women to commit
suicide.  

The increase in mortality rates seen in older jail 
inmates was also evident among older State prisoners. 
The overall death rate was lowest for State prisoners 
age 18-24 (34 per 100,000). The death rate was over 5
times higher for State prisoners age 35-44 (182) and
nearly 17 times higher for prisoners age 45-54 (571).
The mortality rate of the oldest prisoners, age 55 or
older, was highest (2,019 -- or 59 times higher than 
the rate for prisoners age 18-24).

Deaths attributed to "illness/natural cause" made up
80% of all State prison deaths reported during 2001
-02. Two-thirds of all State prison deaths involved 
inmates age 45 or older, though such inmates 
represented 17% of all State prisoners held during 
2001-02.

Despite the close relationship between age and the
overall mortality rates in State prison, inmate age 
was not related to suicide rates. State prisoner 
suicide rates ranged from 13 to 14 suicides per 
100,000 prisoners for every age group over 18. The 
suicide rate of State prisoners under 18 was 4 times 
higher (52 per 100,000), but this age group accounted 
for less than 0.3% of State prisoners and had 3 
suicides nationwide over 2 years. By comparison, 
116 prisoners age 25-34 committed suicide during 
2001-02. 

Age also showed no relationship to State prison
homicide rates, with all age groups over age 18
recording a homicide rate of either 3 or 4 per 
100,000 inmates. No reported homicides involved 
State prisoners under age 18 during 2001-02.

Black inmates had the lowest suicide 
and homicide rates in State prisons 

As in local jails, white inmates had the highest 
overall mortality rate (327 deaths per 100,000 
prisoners). While the mortality rate of white jail 
inmates was 86% higher than that of blacks and 123% 
higher than that of Hispanics, the differences in 
State prison were smaller. White State prisoners 
were 35% more likely than Hispanic inmates (243 
per 100,000) and 58% more likely than black 
prisoners (207)to die during 2001-02. 

White inmates had the highest suicide rate of all 
State prisoners (22 suicides per 100,000 inmates). 
This rate was 22% higher than the Hispanic suicide 
rate (18 per 100,000). By comparison, white inmates 
in local jails were 3 times more likely than 
Hispanics to commit suicide. Black inmates had the 
lowest suicide rate of all State prisoners (8 per 
100,000). Blacks were about a third as likely as 
whites to commit suicide in State prison and less 
than half as likely as Hispanics.

Homicide rates were less than 10 per 100,000 State
prisoners for all racial/ethnic groups during 2001-
02. Hispanic inmates were the most likely to be 
killed in State prisons (7 homicides per 100,000 
inmates), which was over 3 times the homicide rate 
of black inmates (2 per 100,000). The homicide rate 
for white inmates (5)almost matched the rate for all 
State prisoners (4).

Violent offenders committed suicide 
at nearly triple the rate of nonviolent 
offenders in jails

The death rate of violent offenders in local 
jails (212 per 100,000) was 75% higher than 
that of nonviolent offenders (121), but this 
difference was larger in cases of suicide. 

The suicide rate of violent jail inmates (92 
per 100,000)was nearly triple that of nonviolent 
offenders (31). Kidnaping offenders had the 
highest suicide rate (275), followed by those 
inmates held for rape (252) or homicide (182).  

Among all nonviolent offenders, only probation/
parole violators had a suicide rate of at least 
100 per 100,000 (118). Drug offenders were found 
to have the lowest rates of mortality, particularly 
suicide. Drug offenders were the only  group that 
had fewer than 100 deaths from all causes per 
100,000 jail inmates (92). The suicide rate of 
drug offenders (18 per 100,000) was the lowest 
among offender groups. Violent offenders (92)
were 5 times more likely to commit suicide than 
drug offenders, and public-order offenders were 
more than twice as likely to commit suicide (42).   

Local jails had an average of fewer 
than 20 inmate homicides each year

Over 3 years (2000-02), there were 59 jail inmate
homicides reported nationwide, resulting in a rate 
of 3 jail inmate homicide deaths per 100,000 inmates. 
Violent offenders were the most likely to be killed 
in local jail (5 homicides per 100,000 inmates), 
followed by property and public-order offenders (3 
for both). Drug offenders (1 per 100,000) had the 
lowest homicide victimization rate of all offenders.

Kidnaping offenders had the highest rate of jail 
inmate homicide (15 per 100,000 inmates -- 5 
times the rate for all inmates), followed by inmates 
held for rape (9) and violation of parole/ probation 
(7). But even among these offenders with the highest 
homicide rates, a combined total of eight homicides 
took place nationwide over this 3-year period.

Drug offenders had the lowest 
suicide and homicide rates of 
all State prisoners 

State prison mortality rates showed similar patterns 
by offense type. Violent offenders not only had the
highest overall mortality rate (312 deaths per 100,000
prisoners), they were the only State prisoners with a
death rate of at least 200 per 100,000 prisoners held.
Property and public-order offenders each had a rate 
of 184 deaths per 100,000, followed by drug offenders
(166).

Compared to violent offenders in local jails (92 
suicides per 100,000 inmates), the suicide rate of 
violent offenders in State prison (19 per 100,000) 
was much lower. But among State prisoners, violent 
offenders were more than twice as likely to commit 
suicide as nonviolent offenders (9 per 100,000).

Kidnapers had the highest suicide rate (36 per 100,000
prisoners), followed by offenders held for homicide (29),
sexual assault (23), and assault (20). Among nonviolent
offenders, probation/parole violators had the highest
suicide rates (18 per 100,000), followed by offenders
held for arson (16), burglary (14), and obstruction of
justice (14). Drug offenders recorded the lowest suicide
rates of all State prisoners (6 per 100,000 inmates).

The rate of homicide in State prison was 4 per 100,000
prisoners, and varied little across offense types. 
Three types of offenders had as many as 10 homicides 
per 100,000 prisoners -- arsonists (16), kidnapers (15), 
and probation/parole violators (12). Among these three
categories with the highest homicide rates, the number
of homicides was small, with a total of nine prisoners
killed over 2 years. 

State prisoners convicted of fraud and driving while
intoxicated had the lowest rate of homicide, with 
zero homicides reported for 2001-02.     
   
Nearly half of jail suicides occurred 
in the first week of custody

Jail inmate suicides were heavily concentrated in 
the first week spent in custody. Forty-eight percent 
of all jail suicides during 2000-02 took place 
during the inmate's first week following admission. 
In particular, almost a quarter of all jail suicides 
took place either on the date of admission to jail 
(14%) or the following day (9%).

The frequency of jail suicides slowed after the initial
week, with the second week of custody accounting for
10% of jail suicides. The next 2 weeks in custody 
(days 15 to 30) accounted for even fewer suicides(8%).
Despite this early concentration of suicides, more
suicides took place after the 60th day in jail(24%) 
than during the first 2 days (23%).

The median time served in jail prior to committing
suicide was just over 1 week (9 days), but this 
period of time varied across demographic and criminal 
offense categories. Females spent less than half as
much time as males in jail prior to committing suicide
(median time served: 4 days for females and 10 days for
males). The median length of time served by Hispanic
inmates prior to suicide (23 days) was over twice as 
long as the time for white inmates (9 days) and nearly 
4 times longer than that for black inmates (6 days). 

Of all offender groups, public-order offenders spent 
the shortest time in custody prior to committing 
suicide; half of their suicides took place in the first 
3 days of custody. Property and drug offenders each had 
a median time served of about a week (7 and 8 days, 
respectively)prior to suicide. Violent offenders spent 
the longest time in custody prior to suicide; half of 
their suicides took place after spending 3 weeks in 
jail (20 days).

7% of State prison suicides took 
place during the first month

In State prison, suicides were less concentrated 
around admission. Sixty-five percent of jail 
suicides occurred in the first 30 days, but 7% of 
prison suicides took place during the first month. 
Most State prison suicides (65%)took place after 
the inmate's first year of confinement, and 33% 
took place after the inmate had served at least 5 
years in prison.  

The median time served in State prison prior to a 
suicide (30 months) was over 100 times longer than 
in local jails (9 days). Male (30 months) and female 
(29 months)State prisoners spent almost identical 
amounts of time in prison before committing suicide.  
However, race was related to the length of time 
served prior to suicide. Half of all suicides by 
white inmates occurred in the first 21 months of 
custody, while the corresponding figures for black 
(40 months) and Hispanic inmates (49 months)were 
twice as long.

Violent State prisoners spent more time in custody 
prior to suicide than other offenders(median time 
served was 45 months). Drug offenders were the only 
other offender group who served a median of at least 
a year in State prison prior to their suicides (18 
months), followed by property (10 months) and 
public-order offenders(9 months).

At least 80% of suicides in prison 
and jail occurred in the inmate's 
cell; time of day not a factor 

The vast majority of both local jail (80%) and State
prison (87%) inmate suicides took place within the
inmate's cell or room. Temporary holding areas
(lockups) were the next most common location of
suicide events (10% in jails, 4% in prisons). Common
areas such as cafeterias, libraries, and recreational
areas were the scene of very few suicides (6% in jails,
3% in State prisons), as were areas outside of the
correctional facility (2% of jail suicides, 3% percent 
of prison suicides).    

Suicide events in both local jails and State prisons
showed little relationship to the time of day. Aside 
from morning hours (20% of jail suicides), the 
frequency of suicides in other parts of the day varied 
from 24% (during afternoon hours) to 28% (evening and 
overnight hours). Similar data were reported for 
suicides in State prisons. Twenty percent of State 
prisoner suicides took place in the morning, with all 
other times of day varying from 25% (evening and 
overnight hours) to 30% (afternoon hours).  

In both local jails (94%) and State prisons (89%), 
the majority of suicide events were followed up 
by the performance of an autopsy or post-mortem 
examination by a medical examiner or county 
coroner.

Most jail homicides occurred at least 2 
weeks after admission

During 2000-02 the number of homicides in the more
than 3,000 jail jurisdictions nationwide had an 
average of fewer than 20 each year. In State prisons, 
which held nearly 1.2 million inmates nationwide, 
there were fewer than 50 homicides each year during 
2001-02.  

These homicide counts resulted in a rate of less 
than 5 homicides per 100,000 inmates in both State 
prison (4 per 100,000) and local jail (3 per 100,000 
inmates, based on ADP). In the 50 largest jails 
nationwide, the at-risk rate of homicide averaged 
0.4 per 100,000 inmates held during the year.   

Unlike suicides, homicides in local jails were 
not concentrated in the first few days following 
admission. Twelve percent occurred in the first 
2 days in custody, but 54% took place after the 
inmate had served at least 2 weeks in jail. The 
median length of time served prior to a homicide 
death (29 days) was triple that of suicide deaths 
in local jails (9 days). 

Two-thirds of homicide victims in 
State prison had served at least 2 
years in prison; nearly 40% had 
served 5 years or more

The initial months following admission to prison
accounted for a small percentage of State prisoner
homicides. One percent of prison homicides took 
place during the victim's first month in prison, 
and less than a tenth of homicide victims had 
served fewer than 6 months (8%). A fifth of 
homicides involved State prisoners who had served 
less than a year. 
  
Among the 5,824 total prisoner deaths reported
nationwide during 2001-02, fewer than 20 were
homicides of a first-year inmate. Sixty-seven 
percent of State prison homicide victims had spent 
at least 2 years in prison, while 37% had served 
at least 5 years. The median time served in State 
prison by homicide victims was 44 months. Hispanic 
homicide victims (with a median time served of 22 
months) were killed after serving less than half as 
much time as white (46 months) or black (55 months) 
prisoners.

Public-order offenders were the most likely to be 
killed early in their prison terms, with a median 
time served of just under 2 years (23 months). The 
median term served by both drug (40 months) and 
property (45 months)offenders was about twice as 
high. Violent offenders had the longest amount of 
time served in prison prior to being killed, with 
a median term of almost 5 years (55 months). 

Prison suicides took place almost exclusively inside 
the deceased's cell or room (87%); no other location
accounted for even 5% of suicide events. However, over
a quarter of all prison homicides (29%) took place in
common areas within prisons, such as cafeterias,
libraries, workshops, and recreational yards. A small
percentage of homicide events took place in either a
temporary holding area or a location  outside of the
prison facility (3% for each). Prisoners' cells or 
rooms (61%) were the most likely scene of a homicide 
in State prison.  

State prison homicides were over 3 times more likely 
to occur during the morning (39% of homicides) than
between midnight and 6 a.m. (11%).

Nearly all State prison homicides (92%) resulted in 
an autopsy or post-mortem exam of the deceased. All 
but 8 of 87 prisoner homicides during the 2-year period 
were committed by other inmates (91%). Of those "other
homicide" events, most involved escape attempts or
cases in which assailant identity was not established.
Homicide rate of U.S. residents, when standardized,
10 times the rate of jail inmates in 2002

According to rates compiled by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Resident
population experienced 6 homicides and 11 suicides per
100,000 residents. The homicide rates for both State
prisoners (4) and jail inmates (3) were lower than that
for the U.S. population. Suicide rates for both State
prisoners (14) and jail inmates (47) were higher than 
the rate for the resident population. However, reliable
comparisons of such rates require closer analysis.

The demographic compositions of inmate populations
do not reflect those of the U.S. resident population. 
In 2002 the U.S. population was 51% female, 81% white,
and 22% age 55 or older; by comparison, the State
prison population was 6% female, 50% white, and 4%
age 55 or older.  

The suicide and homicide rates of these demographic
subgroups vary substantially. For example, the homicide
rate of black males age 18-24 in the resident population
(108 per 100,000) was over 8 times that for white males 
of the same age (13). As a result, the differing rates 
of death seen in the general population and correctional 
facilities reflect differences in demographic makeup as 
much as differences in the relative safety of these 
environments.

To improve the comparison of mortality risks, the
resident population rates can be standardized by age,
race, and gender to match the proportions seen in
prisons and jails. The resulting rates estimate what 
the resident population mortality rates would be if 
the U.S. resident population had the same demographic
composition as prisons and jails. 

Standardized to match the State prison population, 
the resident population had a homicide rate (35 per
100,000) nearly 9 times the rate of homicide in 
State prisons (4). Standardizing to match local jail
demographics yields a greater difference the resident
rate (32 per 100,000) being nearly 11 times higher 
than the rate in jails (3).

State prisoners had a higher rate of suicide (14 per
100,000) than the overall resident population (11). 
Once standardized to match the State prisoner 
population, the U.S. resident rate of suicide (18) 
exceeded that of State prisoners in 2002.  

The standardized resident suicide rate (17 per 100,000)
was less than half of the jail suicide rate based on ADP
(47). However, an at-risk rate of jail suicide would be 
a more appropriate comparison, but not all jails reported
the needed admission data. Based on the at-risk measure 
of suicide for the top 50 jail jurisdictions, an at-risk 
jail suicide rate for all jails would likely be less 
than a tenth of the ADP measure. (See page 5.)

Methodology

BJS phased in data collection activity under the Death 
in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (PL 106-297), with the
first collection of death records covering only local 
jail facilities. The 2000 jail collection covered the 
entire calendar year (the act became law in October of 
2000), while subsequent collections were done on the 
quarterly basis required by the act.  

BJS requires a quarterly report from all jails which 
had an inmate death during the period. All jails were
instructed to complete an annual summary of death
reports and population counts (to allow for calculation 
of death rates). 

Jail response rates for all 3 years were over 99%. In
2000, 3,063 jurisdictions responded, and 9 refused, for
a response rate of 99.7%. Data for 2001 was submitted
by 3,049 jurisdictions, with 2 refusals, for a response
rate of 99.9%. In 2002, data were submitted by 3,030
jurisdictions and refused by 6, for a response rate of
99.8%.

Quarterly collection of State prison inmate death records
began in 2001. These records were collected from State
departments of corrections, rather than from each prison
facility.  For all years, BJS has had 100% participation
from all 50 State prison systems. Data were also
collected from the District of Columbia for 2001 in which
it still operated a prison system, prior to transferring
sentenced felons to the custody of the Federal Bureau
of Prisons. 

Copies of all questionnaires collected under the 
Deaths in Custody series can be found on the BJS 
website at <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/quest.htm>.
 
Standardized U.S. resident death rates

Homicide and suicide rates for specific age, race, and
gender groups within the U.S. population can be queried
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
online injury mortality reports
http://webappa.cdc.gov/sasweb/ncipc/mortrate.html>.
For example, the 2002 suicide rate for white females,
age 35-44, was 7.8 per 100,000. These rates were then
standardized to match the characteristics of State
prison and local jail populations by weighting the 
rates by the proportion of all inmates represented by 
that subgroup. The sum of all of the weighted subgroup 
rates provides the standardized rate for the resident
population.

Population proportions for these gender, race and age
subgroups of inmates were derived from the National 
Corrections Reporting Program (for State prisoners) 
and the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails(for 
jail inmates).

Population bases for mortality rates

Annual mortality rates were based on different
population counts:

1. For prisons the custody population on June 30 
of each year
2. For local jails the average daily population in 
each calendar year. Estimates of the population at 
risk for the largest jail jurisdictions combined 
the population on January 1 and admissions during 
the year.
