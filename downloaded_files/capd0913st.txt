Crime Against Persons with Disabilities, 2009–2013 - 
Statistical Tables

Erika Harrell, Ph.D., BJS Statistician

The rate of violent victimization against persons with 
disabilities (36 per 1,000) was more than twice the age-
adjusted rate for persons without disabilities (14 per 
1,000) in 2013. Persons with disabilities experienced 1.3 
million violent victimizations, accounting for 21% of all 
violent victimizations (figure 1). Nonfatal violent crimes 
include rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, 
and simple assault.

The findings in this report are based on the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National Crime Victimization 
Survey (NCVS), a household survey that collects data on U.S. 
residents age 12 or older (excluding those living in 
institutions). The NCVS adopted survey questions from the 
U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) to 
identify crime victims with disabilities. The NCVS defines 
disability as the product of interactions among individuals’ 
bodies; their physical, emotional, and mental health; and 
the physical and social environment in which they live, 
work, or play. Disability exists where this interaction 
results in limitations of activities and restrictions to 
full participation at school, at work, at home, or in the 
community. Disabilities are classified according to six 
limitations: hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-
care, and independent living.

Data from the ACS were used to estimate age-adjusted 
victimization rates for persons without disabilities. Unless 
stated as age-adjusted, findings are unadjusted. For this 
report, victimization rates were generated by using the ACS 
population estimates for persons with disabilities. The 
Methodology further details data sources, computational 
procedures, and data limitations.

The statistical tables in this report detail the level and 
rates of nonfatal violent victimization against persons with 
and without disabilities, describe the types of 
disabilities, and compare victim characteristics. They also 
include information on the crime incident, such as time of 
the crime, police notification of the crime, and information 
on victim services. With the exception of figure 1, all 
estimates are based on 2-year rolling averages centered on 
the most recent year. For example, estimates reported for 
2013 represent the average estimates for 2012 and 2013. This 
method improves the reliability and stability of estimate 
comparisons over time.

*************************************
Violent crime by victim’s age 
and disability status
*************************************

* In 2013, for each age group measured except for persons 
age 65 or older, the rate of violent victimization against 
persons with disabilities was at least double the rate for 
those without disabilities (table 1). Among persons age 65 
or older, there was no statistically significant difference 
in the rate of violent victimization by disability status (4 
per 1,000).

* Except for persons ages 50 to 64 with disabilities, there 
was no statistically significant difference in the 2012 and 
2013 rates of violent victimization against persons with 
disabilities for each of the age groups measured. Among 
persons ages 50 to 64 with disabilities, the rate of violent 
victimization increased from 2012 (28 per 1,000) to 2013 (42 
per 1,000).

******************************************

********************************
The use of age-adjusted rates
********************************

The differences in age distributions between the two 
populations must be taken into account when making direct 
comparisons of the violent victimization rate between 
persons with and without disabilities. The age distribution 
of persons with disabilities differs considerably from that 
of persons without disabilities, and violent crime 
victimization rates vary significantly with age. According 
to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS), 
persons with disabilities are generally older than persons 
without disabilities. For example, about 42% of persons with 
disabilities were age 65 or older in 2013, compared to 12% 
of persons without disabilities (appendix table 18). The age 
adjustment standardizes the rate of violence to show what 
the rate would be if persons without disabilities had the 
same age distribution as persons with disabilities.

********************************************

*************************************
Violent crime by type of crime
*************************************

* The rate of violent victimization against persons with 
disabilities (36 per 1,000) was more than twice the age-
adjusted rate for persons without disabilities (14 per 
1,000) in 2013 (table 2).

* In 2013, the rate of serious violent victimization for 
persons with disabilities (14 per 1,000) was more than three 
times higher than the age-adjusted rate for persons without 
disabilities (4 per 1,000).

* The rate of simple assault against persons with 
disabilities (22 per 1,000) was more than twice the age-
adjusted rate for persons without disabilities in 2013 (10 
per 1,000).

* No statistically significant difference was found in the 
2009, 2012, and 2013 rates of violent crime against persons 
with disabilities. The same pattern was found in the age-
adjusted rates of violent crime against persons without 
disabilities.

* The rate of aggravated assault against persons with 
disabilities increased from 4 per 1,000 in 2009 to 7 per 
1,000 in 2013.

* There was no statistically significant difference found in 
the 2009 and 2013 rates of rape or sexual assault, robbery, 
and simple assault against persons with disabilities.

* Serious violence (rape or sexual assault, robbery, or 
aggravated assault) in 2013 accounted for a greater 
percentage of violence against persons with disabilities 
(39%) than violence against persons without disabilities 
(29%) (not shown).

* In 2013, 24% of violent crime victims with disabilities 
believed they were targeted due to their disability, an 
increase from 2009 (13%) (not shown).

*************************************
Violent crime rates by sex, race, 
and Hispanic origin 
*************************************

Sex
******

* In 2013, for both males and females, the rate of violent 
victimization was higher for persons with disabilities than 
the age-adjusted rate for those without disabilities (table 
3).

* The unadjusted rate of violent victimization against males 
with disabilities was 37 per 1,000 in 2013, compared to the 
age-adjusted rate  of 16 per 1,000 for males without 
disabilities.

* For females with disabilities, the rate of violence was 35 
per 1,000 in 2013, compared to 12 per 1,000 females without 
disabilities.

* In 2013, no statistically significant difference was found 
in the rate of violent victimization against males with 
disabilities (37 per 1,000) and females with disabilities 
(35 per 1,000). However, among persons without disabilities, 
males (16 per 1,000) had a higher age-adjusted rate than 
females (12 per 1,000).

* The rate of violence against males with disabilities 
increased from 26 per 1,000 to 37 per 1,000 from 2009 to 
2013. No statistically significant difference was found for 
females over the same period.

* For males and females with disabilities, there was no 
statistically significant difference in the 2012 and 2013 
rates of violent victimization.

Race and Hispanic origin
****************************

* For each racial group measured except for blacks, persons 
with disabilities had higher age-adjusted violent 
victimization rates than the age-adjusted rates of persons 
without disabilities in 2013.

* Among blacks, the apparent difference in the rates of 
violent victimization by disability status in 2013 was not 
statistically significant.

* Except for whites, there was no statistically significant 
difference in the 2009 and 2013 rates of violent 
victimization among persons with disabilities for each 
racial group examined.

* The rate of violent victimization against whites with 
disabilities increased from 28 per 1,000 in 2009 to 38 per 
1,000 in 2013.

* In 2013, among persons with disabilities, whites (38 per 
1,000) and blacks (31 per 1,000) had higher rates of violent 
victimization than persons of other races (15 per 1,000).

* There was no difference found in the unadjusted and age-
adjusted rates of violent victimization against persons of 
Hispanic origin with and without disabilities in 2013.

* Among both Hispanics and non-Hispanics, persons with 
disabilities had a higher unadjusted rate of violent 
victimization than the age-adjusted rate for persons without 
disabilities in 2013.

Types of disability
*********************

* In 2013, persons with cognitive disabilities (67 per 
1,000)had the highest rate of violent victimization among 
all disability types measured (table 4). This was similar to 
previous years.

* In 2013, persons with hearing disabilities (17 per 1,000) 
had the lowest rate of violent victimization among the 
disability types examined.

* Persons with hearing (8 per 1,000), vision (12 per 1,000), 
and self-care (9 per 1,000) disabilities had similar rates 
of serious violent victimization in 2013 (table 5).

* The 2013 rate of simple assault against persons with 
cognitive disabilities (42 per 1,000) was at least twice 
that of any other disability type measured (table 6).

* Among both males and females, those with cognitive 
disabilities had the highest rate of violent victimization 
among the disability types measured in 2013 (table 7).

* In 2013, among males, those with ambulatory disabilities 
(38 per 1,000) had a slightly higher rate of violent 
victimization than those with self-care disabilities (24 per 
1,000).  Among females, those with ambulatory and self-care 
disabilities had similar violent victimization rates (28 per 
1,000 each).

Violent crime by number of disability types
********************************************

* About 51% of violence against persons with disabilities 
involved victims with multiple disability types in 2013, 
similar to the percentage found in 2012 (52%), and up 
slightly from 2009 (41%) (table 8).

* The percentage of serious violence against persons with 
disabilities involving persons with multiple disabilities 
has increased slightly from 37% in 2009 to 51% in 2013.

* In 2013, there was no statistically significant difference 
in the rates of violent victimization in persons with a 
single disability type (35 per 1,000) and persons with 
multiple disability types (37 per 1,000) (table 9).	

* Persons with a single disability type had a slightly lower 
rate of rape and sexual assault (1 per 1,000) than those 
with multiple disability types (3 per 1,000) in 2013.

* The 2013 rate of robbery victimization was slightly higher 
in persons with a single disability type (7 per 1,000) than 
in persons with multiple disability types (4 per 1,000).

* The 2013 rates of aggravated and simple assault did not 
differ by the number of disability types.

* After slightly declining in 2010 and 2011, the rate of 
violence against persons with a single disability type 
increased to a similar level found in 2009 (33 per 1,000 in 
2009 compared to 35 per 1,000 in 2013).

* The rate of violent victimization against persons with 
multiple disability types increased from 2009 (24 per 1,000) 
to 2012 (37 per 1,000) and remained steady through 2013.

Victim–offender relationship
********************************

* A lower percentage of violence against persons with 
disabilities was committed by strangers (31%) than against 
persons without disabilities (39%) in 2013 (table 10).

* The percentage of violence against persons with 
disabilities committed by intimate partners declined from 
2009 (22%) to 2011 (14%) and remained steady through 2013 
(15%).

* In 2013, 41% of violence against persons with disabilities 
was committed by persons they knew well or by casual 
acquaintances, compared to 35% of violence against persons 
without disabilities.

Time of crime
***************

* For violent crime victims with and without disabilities, a 
higher percentage of the violence occurred during daytime (6 
a.m.–6 p.m.) than during nighttime (6 p.m.–6 a.m.) (table 
11).

* The percentage of violence against persons with 
disabilities that occurred during the daytime did not 
significantly change during the study period.

* In 2013, 58% of violent crime against persons with 
disabilities occurred during the daytime, compared to 53% of 
violence against persons without disabilities.

Police reporting
*******************

* In 2013, 48% of violence against persons with disabilities 
was reported to police, compared to 44% for persons without 
disabilities (table 12).

* During the study period, the percentage of violent crime 
against persons with disabilities that was reported to 
police did not change significantly.

* In 2013, there was no statistically significant difference 
by victim disability status in the percentage of violence 
reported to police.

 * In 2013, there was no statistically significant 
difference between the percentages of violence against 
persons with single disability types (46%) and persons with 
multiple disability types (49%) being reported to police.

* The percentage of violence against persons with multiple 
disability types that was reported to the police dropped 
from 61% in 2009 to 44% in 2012 and remained steady in 2013 
(49%).

* In every year studied, the majority of violent crime 
against persons with disabilities that was reported to 
police was done so by the victim (table 13). This was 
similar to violent crime victims without disabilities.

* The percentage of violent crime against persons with 
disabilities that was reported by the victim declined from 
71% in 2009 to 58% in 2013.

* While the percentage of violence against persons with 
disabilities that was reported by other household members 
and someone official did not change from 2009 to 2013, the 
percentage of violence reported by someone else increased 
from 11% in 2009 to 23% in 2013.

* In 2013, the most common reason why violent crimes against 
persons with disabilities were not reported to police was 
because they were dealt with in another way (44%) (table 
14).

* In 2013, for each reason for not reporting crime to police 
that was measured, the percentages were similar by victim 
disability status.

* The percentage of violent crime victims with disabilities 
whose crimes were not reported to police because they were 
not important enough to the victim increased slightly from 
13% in 2009 to 21% in 2013.

Victim services
*****************

* In 2013, violent crime victims with disabilities (12%) 
were somewhat more likely than those without disabilities 
(8%) to receive assistance from victim services agencies 
(table 15). 

* Except for 2010, the percentage of violent crime against 
persons with disabilities in which the victim received 
assistance from victim services agencies was slightly higher 
than for those without disabilities in each year studied.

* During the study period, the percentage of violent crime 
victims with disabilities who received assistance from 
victim services agencies did not change significantly 
(between 11% and 15%).

Methodology
******************

Survey coverage
*****************

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an ongoing 
data collection conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The NCVS is a self-
report survey in which interviewed persons are asked about 
the number and characteristics of victimizations they 
experienced during the prior 6 months. The NCVS collects 
information on nonfatal personal crimes (rape or sexual 
assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and 
personal larceny) and household property crimes (burglary, 
motor vehicle theft, and other theft) both reported and not 
reported to police. In addition to providing annual level 
and change estimates on criminal victimization, the NCVS is 
the primary source of information on the nature of criminal 
victimization incidents.

Survey respondents provide information about themselves 
(e.g., age, sex, race and Hispanic origin, marital status, 
education level, and income) and whether they experienced a 
victimization. The NCVS collects information for each 
victimization incident about the offender (e.g., age, race 
and Hispanic origin, sex, and victim–offender relationship), 
characteristics of the crime (including time and place of 
occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic 
consequences), whether the crime was reported to police, 
reasons the crime was or was not reported, and victims’ 
experiences with the criminal justice system.

The NCVS is administered to persons age 12 or older from a 
nationally representative sample of households in the United 
States. The NCVS defines a household as a group of members 
who all reside at a sampled address. Persons are considered 
household members when the sampled address is their usual 
place of residence at the time of the interview and when 
they have no usual place of residence elsewhere. Once 
selected, households remain in the sample for 3 years, and 
eligible persons in these households are interviewed every 
6 months either in person or over the phone, for a total of 
seven interviews.

All first interviews are conducted in person with subsequent 
interviews conducted either in person or by phone. New 
households rotate into the sample on an ongoing basis to 
replace outgoing households that have been in the sample 
for the 3-year period. The sample includes persons living 
in group quarters (such as dormitories, rooming houses, and 
religious group dwellings) and excludes persons living in 
military barracks and institutional settings (such as 
correctional or hospital facilities) and persons who are 
homeless.

In 2007, the NCVS adopted questions from the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) to measure the rate 
of victimization against people with disabilities. The NCVS 
does not identify persons in the general population with 
disabilities. The ACS Subcommittee on Disability Questions 
developed the disability questions based on questions used 
in the 2000 Decennial Census and earlier versions of the 
ACS. The questions identify persons who may require 
assistance to maintain their independence, be at risk for 
discrimination, or lack opportunities available to the 
general population because of limitations related to a 
prolonged (i.e., 6 months or longer) sensory, physical, 
mental, or emotional condition. More information about the 
ACS and the disability questions is available on the U.S. 
Census Bureau website at http://www.census.gov/acs/www/.

Changes to the disability questions 
in the NCVS and ACS in 2008
****************************************

In 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau changed some of the 
disability questions on the ACS. The question about sensory 
disability was separated into two questions about blindness 
and deafness, and the questions about physical disability 
asked only about serious difficulty walking or climbing 
stairs. Also, questions on employment disability and going 
outside of the home were eliminated in 2008. Census Bureau 
analysis of 2007 and 2008 ACS disability data revealed 
significant conceptual and measurement differences between 
the 2007 and 2008 disability questions. The Census Bureau 
concluded that data users should not compare the 2007 
estimates of the population with disabilities and those of 
later years. Because the 2007 and 2008 NCVS disability 
questions mirrored the ACS, estimates of victimization of 
people with disabilities from the 2007 and 2008 NCVS should 
not be compared. As a result, the 2007 disability data are 
not presented in this report. Further explanation about 
incomparability of the 2007 and 2008 ACS disability data is 
available at 
http://www.census.gov/acs/www/Downloads/methodology/content_
test/P4_Disability.pdf.

Definitions of disability types
*********************************

Disabilities are classified according to six limitations: 
hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and 
independent living.

* Hearing limitation entails deafness or serious 
difficulty hearing.

* Vision limitation is blindness or serious difficulty 
seeing, even when wearing glasses.

* Cognitive limitation includes serious difficulty in 
concentrating, remembering, or making decisions 
because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition.

* Ambulatory limitation is difficulty walking or 
climbing stairs.

* Self-care limitation is a condition that causes difficulty 
dressing or bathing.

* Independent living limitation is a physical, mental, or 
emotional condition that impedes doing errands alone, such 
as visiting a doctor or shopping.

Disability questions included in 
the NCVS from 2008 through 2013
*********************************

Questions 169a through 173

169a. Are you deaf or do you have serious difficulty 
hearing?

169b. Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing 
even when wearing glasses?

170a. Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, 
do you have serious difficulty--

* concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?
* walking or climbing stairs?

* dressing or bathing?

170b. Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, 
do you have difficulty doing errands alone, such as visiting 
a doctor’s office or shopping?

171. Is “Yes” marked in any of 169a–170b? (That is, has the 
respondent indicated that he/she has a health condition or 
disability?)

172. During the incident you just told me about, do you have 
reason to suspect you were victimized because of your health 
condition(s), impairment(s), or disability(ies)?

173. What health conditions, impairments, or disabilities do 
you believe caused you to be targeted for this incident?

In the ACS, persons ages 12 to 14 are not asked about having 
an independent living disability and are therefore not 
included in the populations with independent living 
disabilities. Even though crime victims ages 12 to 14 
receive this question in the NCVS (question 170b), victims 
ages 12 to 14 who respond affirmatively are excluded from 
rates of violent victimization against persons with an 
independent living disability in order to match the age 
limitations for having an independent living disability in 
the ACS (age 15 or older). In this report, rates of violence 
against persons with an independent living disability are 
per 1,000 persons age 15 or older, compared to rates per 
1,000 persons age 12 or older for other disability types. 
Also, violent crime victims ages 12 to 14 who report in the 
NCVS that they have an independent living disability and no 
other disability are classified as not having a disability 
to be compatible with age limits on disability definitions 
in the ACS.

Limitations of the estimates
*********************************

The NCVS was designed to measure the incidence of criminal 
victimization against the U.S. civilian household 
population, excluding persons who live in institutions and 
the homeless. In this report, institutions refer to adult 
correctional facilities, juvenile facilities, nursing or 
skilled nursing facilities, inpatient hospice facilities, 
residential schools for people with disabilities, and 
hospitals with patients who have no usual home elsewhere. 
The measures of crime against persons with disabilities (as 
measured by the NCVS) cover only people with disabilities 
who are living among the general population in household 
settings. Subsequently, there is some coverage error in 
using just the noninstitutionalized population. For example, 
according to the ACS, about 96% of the 1.3 million people 
age 65 or older living in institutions had disabilities in 
2013 (not shown). Because persons in these facilities would 
not be covered in the NCVS, estimates of violence against 
these persons are not counted. The lack of information from 
the institutions will result in an undercount of violence 
against persons with disabilities.

Certain aspects of the NCVS design can also contribute to an 
underestimation of the level or type of violence against 
persons with disabilities. For example, the survey 
instruments, modes of interview, and interviewing protocols 
used in the NCVS may not be suited for interviewing people 
who have difficulty communicating, especially by telephone. 
Some people have disabilities that limit their verbal 
communication and use technology to enhance their ability to 
communicate, but many people do not have access to such 
technology.

Proxy interviews may also lead to an underestimate of 
violence against persons with disabilities. The survey 
requires direct interviews with eligible respondents and 
allows the use of proxy interviews with a caregiver or other 
eligible party in a limited set of circumstances. A proxy 
interview is allowed when a respondent is physically or 
mentally incapable of responding. The survey restrictions on 
proxy interviews were instituted because someone else may 
not know about the victimization experiences of the 
respondent, and because the person providing the information 
via proxy may be the perpetrator of the abuse or violence 
experienced by the respondent. Because proxy respondents may 
be more likely to omit crime incidents or may not know some 
details about reported incidents, the number or types of 
crimes against persons with disabilities may be 
underestimated. In 2013, information about 2% of violent 
crime incidents against persons with disabilities was 
obtained from proxy interviews. In addition, 80% of the 
reports of violent incidents against persons with 
disabilities obtained through proxy interviews were for 
simple assault, compared to about 62% of reports of violent 
incidents against persons with disabilities obtained through 
nonproxy interviews (not shown).

Disability population in the United States
********************************************

According to the ACS, about 14% of the U.S. population age 
12 or older living outside of institutions in 2013 had a 
disability. Characteristics of the population with and 
without disabilities are compared in appendix table 18. In 
2013, among noninstitutionalized persons with disabilities, 
48% were male and 52% were female. Whites accounted for 
about 77% of the population with disabilities, blacks 
accounted for 14%, and persons of two or more races 
accounted for 2%. About 11% were Hispanic. About 42% of the 
population with disabilities was age 65 or older, compared 
to about 12% of the population without disabilities. The 
2013 ACS population estimates of persons by disability 
status were generated from Public Use Microdata Sample 
(PUMS) data.

Public Use Microdata Sample data
************************************

To generate populations by disability status for 2008 
through 2010, the U.S. Census Bureau generated these 
estimates for the BJS from the full, confidential ACS 
dataset. Due to budgetary restrictions, PUMS data from the 
Census Bureau’s ACS were used to calculate populations by 
disability status for 2011 through 2013. The ACS PUMS 
dataset is a sample of population and housing unit records 
from the ACS. Usually, the PUMS files include only about 
two-thirds of the cases contained in the larger confidential 
dataset. The ACS PUMS files include the actual responses 
collected in ACS questionnaires, although some responses 
have been edited to protect the confidentiality of 
respondents. The ACS PUMS file included sample weights for 
each person and housing unit, which were applied to the 
individual records to expand the sample to estimate totals 
and percentages of the full population. For more information 
on PUMS data from the Census Bureau, see 
http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/public_use_
microdata_sample/.

Direct standardization
**************************

The method used to generate age-adjusted rates of violent 
victimization of persons without disabilities presented in 
this report was direct standardization with the population 
with disabilities as the standard population ***FOOTNOTE 1: 
For more information on direct standardization, see Curtin, 
L.R. & Klein, R.J. (1995). Direct standardization (age-
adjusted death rates). Healthy People 2000: Statistical 
Notes, 6 Revised. Available at 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt06rv.pdf.*** Age-
adjusted standardization eliminates the problem of different 
age distributions between and within groups. In general, 
persons with disabilities are an older population than 
persons without disabilities. Because crime rates vary by 
age, direct standardization produces age-adjusted rates for 
persons without disabilities that would occur if the 
population without disabilities had the same age 
distribution as the population with disabilities.
 
The violent victimization rate, age-adjusted using direct 
standardization (Rd) is calculated as--

Rd = Σ  (wa * ra) 

Where

Rd = age-adjusted rate of violent victimization of the 
population without disabilities calculated using direct 
standardization 

wa = weight calculated from the population with disabilities 
for age-group a 

ra = unadjusted rate of violent victimization of persons 
without disabilities in age-group a 

d = direct standardization.

The weight (wa) for age-group a is calculated as— 

wa = na / N 

where

wa = weight calculated from the population with disabilities 
for age-group a 

na = number of persons in age-group a in the population with 
disabilities

N = total number of persons in the population with 
disabilities.

This method produces rates of violent victimization as if 
the population of interest had the same age distribution as 
the population with disabilities. To use this method to 
calculate the violent victimization rate of persons without 
disabilities, ra would represent the unadjusted violent 
victimization rate against persons without disabilities in 
age-group a.

Change in direct standardization calculations
***********************************************

In previous BJS reports about crimes against persons with 
disabilities, several different methods have been used to 
calculate age-adjusted rates. More specifically, changes in 
the standard population were made. Over the years, the 
population without disabilities and the 2000 U.S. standard 
population generated by the U.S. Census Bureau have both 
been used as the standard population in calculating age-
adjusted rates for persons with and without disabilities. 
Each time a change was made to the standard population, 
rates for all years were recalculated using the new standard 
population. This resulted in previous years having different 
rates from earlier reports. 

In this report, BJS changed the calculation of victimization 
rates by disability status. For each year, unadjusted rates 
were calculated for persons with disabilities. For persons 
without disabilities, rates were age adjusted to the 
population of with disabilities for that year. For example, 
the 2012–2013 rate of violent victimization against persons 
with disabilities was unadjusted. The 2012–2013 rate of 
violent victimization for persons without disabilities was 
age adjusted using the 2012–2013 population with 
disabilities as the standard population.

Nonresponse and weighting adjustments
*****************************************

In 2013, about 90,630 households and 160,040 persons age 12 
or older were interviewed for the NCVS. Each household was 
interviewed twice during the year. The response rate was 84% 
for households and 88% for eligible persons. Victimizations 
that occurred outside of the United States were excluded 
from this report. In 2013, less than 1% of the unweighted 
victimizations occurred outside of the United States and 
were excluded from the analyses.

Estimates in this report use data from the 2008 to 2013 NCVS 
data files weighted to produce annual estimates for persons 
age 12 or older living in U.S. households. Because the NCVS 
relies on a sample rather than a census of the entire U.S. 
population, weights are designed to inflate sample point 
estimates to known population totals and to compensate for 
survey nonresponse and other aspects of the sample design.

The NCVS data files include both household and person 
weights. The household weight is commonly used to calculate 
estimates of property crimes, such as motor vehicle theft or 
burglary, which are identified with the household. Person 
weights provide an estimate of the population represented by 
each person in the sample. Person weights are most 
frequently used to compute estimates of crime victimizations 
of persons in the total population. After proper adjustment, 
both household and person weights are also used to form the 
denominator in calculations of crime rates.

The victimization weights used in this analysis account for 
the number of persons present during an incident and for 
repeat victims of when a series of incidents occurs. The 
weight counts a series of incidents as the actual number of 
incidents reported by the victim, up to a maximum of 10 
incidents. Series victimizations are victimizations that are 
similar in type but occur with such frequency that a victim 
is unable to recall each individual event or to describe 
each event in detail. Survey procedures allow NCVS 
interviewers to identify and classify these similar 
victimizations as series victimizations and collect detailed 
information on only the most recent incident in the series. 
In 2013, series incidents accounted for about 1% of all 
victimizations and 4% of all violent victimizations. The 
approach to weighting series incidents as the number of 
incidents up to a maximum of 10 produces more reliable 
estimates of crime levels, while the cap at 10 minimizes the 
effect of extreme outliers on the rates. Additional 
information on the series enumeration is detailed in the 
report Methods for Counting High Frequency Repeat 
Victimizations in the National Crime Victimization Survey 
(NCJ 237308, BJS web, April 2012).

Standard error computations for counts, 
percentages, and unadjusted rates
*****************************************

When national estimates are derived from a sample, as is the 
case with the NCVS, caution must be taken when comparing one 
estimate to another or when comparing estimates over time. 
Although one estimate may be larger than another, estimates 
based on a sample have some degree of sampling error. The 
sampling error of an estimate depends on several factors, 
including the amount of variation in the responses, the size 
of the sample, and the size of the subgroup for which the 
estimate is computed. When the sampling error around the 
estimates is taken into consideration, the estimates that 
appear different may not be statistically different.
One measure of the sampling error associated with an 
estimate is the standard error. The standard error can vary 
from one estimate to the next. In general, for a given 
metric, an estimate with a smaller standard error provides a 
more reliable approximation of the true value than an 
estimate with a larger standard error. Estimates with 
relatively large standard errors are associated with less 
precision and reliability and should be interpreted with 
caution.

To generate standard errors around numbers and estimates 
from the NCVS, the Census Bureau produces generalized 
variance function (GVF) parameters for BJS. The GVFs take 
into account aspects of the NCVS complex sample design and 
represent the curve fitted to a selection of individual 
standard errors based on the Jackknife Repeated Replication 
technique. The GVF parameters were used to generate standard 
errors for each point estimate (such as counts, percentages, 
and rates) in the report. For estimates, standard errors 
were based on the ratio of the sums of victimizations and 
respondents across years.

BJS conducted tests to determine whether differences in 
estimated numbers, percentages, and unadjusted rates in this 
report were statistically significant once sampling error 
was taken into account. Using statistical programs developed 
specifically for the NCVS, all comparisons in the text were 
tested for significance. The primary test procedure was the 
Student’s t-statistic, which tests the difference between 
two sample estimates. Differences described as higher, 
lower, or different passed a test at the 0.05 level of 
statistical significance (95% confidence level). Differences 
described as somewhat, slightly, or marginally different, or 
with some indication of difference, passed a test at the 
0.10 level of statistical significance (90% confidence 
level). Caution is required when comparing estimates not 
explicitly discussed in this report.

Data users can use the estimates and the standard errors of 
the estimates provided in this report to generate a 
confidence interval around the estimate as a measure of the 
margin of error. The following example illustrates how 
standard errors can be used to generate confidence 
intervals:

According to the NCVS, during 2012 and 2013, 50.3% of simple 
assault against persons with disabilities involved victims 
with multiple disability types (see table 8). Using the 
GVFs, BJS determined that the estimate has a standard error 
of 3.9% (see appendix table 10). A confidence interval 
around the estimate was generated by multiplying the 
standard errors by ±1.96 (the t-score of a normal, two-
tailed distribution that excludes 2.5% at either end of the 
distribution). 

Therefore, the confidence interval around the 50.3% estimate 
from 2012 and 2013 is 50.3% + 3.9% x ± 1.96 (or 42.6% to 
58.1%). In other words, if different samples using the same 
procedures were taken from the U.S. population during 2012 
and 2013, 95% of the time the percentage of violent crimes 
against persons with disabilities in which the victim had 
multiple disability types would fall between 42.6% and 
58.1%.

In this report, a coefficient of variation (CV), 
representing the ratio of the standard error to the 
estimate, was also calculated for all estimates. CVs provide 
a measure of reliability and a means for comparing the 
precision of estimates across measures with differing levels 
or metrics. In cases where the CV was greater than 50%, or 
the unweighted sample had 10 or fewer cases, the estimate 
was noted with a “!” symbol (Interpret data with caution. 
Estimate based on 10 or fewer sample cases, or coefficient 
of variation is greater than 50%.)

Standard error computations and statistical 
significance for age-adjusted rates
*****************************************

Due to the complexity in generating age-adjusted rates of 
violent crime, other methods were used to compute standard 
errors and determine statistical significance ***FOOTNOTE 2
For more information on computing standard errors for 
age-adjusted rates, see Anderson, R.N., & Rosenberg, H.M. 
(1998). Age standardization of death rates: Implementation 
of the year 2000 standard. National Vital Statistics Reports, 
47 (3). Available at 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr47/nvs47_03.pdf.***
The standard error for age-adjusted rates was calculated as--

	Sd = √Σ (wa2 * va)     

Where

Sd = standard error for an age-adjusted weight that was 
computed using direct standardization	

wa = weight calculated from the population with disabilities 
for age-group a

va = variance calculated age-group-specific rate using 
information from the generalized variance function (GVF) 
parameters that the Census Bureau produced for the NCVS.

To calculate statistical significance among two age-adjusted 
rates, the standard errors for the two rates were calculated 
using the formula above. A Student’s t-statistic also was 
calculated, which tests the difference between two sample 
estimates. Differences described as higher, lower, or 
different passed a test at the 0.05 level of statistical 
significance (95% confidence level). Differences described 
as somewhat, slightly, or marginally different, or with some 
indication of difference, passed a test at the 0.10 level of 
statistical significance (90% confidence level). 

Property crime
******************

Measuring property crime against households with persons 
with disabilities is difficult using the National Crime 
Victimization Survey (NCVS) due to the nature of capturing 
property crimes and the placement of the disability 
questions on the NCVS incident form (NCVS-2). In the NCVS, 
only the household respondent is asked about property crimes 
for the entire household. If the household has experienced a 
property crime, the household respondent is asked about 
various characteristics defined in the NCVS-2, including 
their disability status. The household respondent is not 
asked about the disability status of anyone else in the 
household. If the household respondent does not report 
having a disability, the NCVS cannot be used to determine if 
anyone else in the household has a disability. As a result, 
property crime by disability status in not included in this 
report.

Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness 
Act (Public Law 105-301), 1998
*******************************************

The Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act mandates 
that the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) include 
statistics on crimes against people with disabilities and 
the characteristics of these victims. The act was designed 
“to increase public awareness of the plight of victims of 
crime with developmental disabilities, to collect data to 
measure the magnitude of the problem, and to develop 
strategies to address the safety and justice needs of 
victims of crime with developmental disabilities.” Section 5 
of the act directed the Department of Justice to include 
statistics relating to “the nature of crimes against people 
with developmental disabilities; and the specific 
characteristics of the victims of those crimes” in the NCVS. 
This report is a part of the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ 
(BJS) series on crime against people with disabilities. More 
information can be found on the BJS website.
