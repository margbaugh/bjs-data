In 1992 offenders armed with handguns committed a record 931,000
violent crimes.  Handgun crimes accounted for  about 13% of all
violent crimes.  As measured by the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS), the rate of nonfatal handgun victimizations in
1992--4.5 crimes per 1,000 people age 12 or older--supplanted the
record of 4.0 per 1,000 in 1982.  

On average in 1987-92 about 83,000 crime victims per year used a
firearm to defend themselves or their property.  Three-fourths of
the victims who used a firearm for defense did so during a violent
crime; a fourth, during a theft, household burglary, or motor
vehicle theft.

For 1987-92 victims reported an annual average of about 341,000
incidents of firearm theft.  Because the NCVS asks for types but
not a count of items stolen, the annual total of firearms stolen
probably exceeded the number of incidents.

*Rate per 1,000 persons age 12 or older in each age category. 
Rates do not include murder or nonnegligent manslaughter committed
with handguns.  The totals include persons of other races not shown
separately.

Violent crime rates

Unlike the record rate of handgun crimes in 1992, the overall rates
for violent crimes were well below the 1981 peaks. (Except where
noted, this brief excludes homicides, which NCVS does not measure.) 
The total 1992 rate for rape, robbery, and aggravated and simple
assault was 35 per 1,000 persons, compared to 39 per 1,000 in 1981. 
The 1992 rate of 17 per 1,000 for the more serious violent crimes
(rape, robbery, and aggravated assault)*was also less than the 20
per 1,000 in 1981.

Most likely victims of handgun crime

*Males were twice as likely as females to be victims of handgun
crimes, and blacks 3 times as likely as whites.

*Young black males continued to be the population subgroup most
vulnerable to handgun crime victimization.

For males age 16-19--
    The rate for blacks (40 per 1,000 persons)
    was 4 times that of whites (10 per 1,000).
For males age 20-24--
    The rate for blacks (29 per 1,000)
    was 3 times that of whites (9 per 1,000).

When offenders fired at victims

*Offenders fired their weapon in 17% of all nonfatal handgun crimes
(or about 2% of all violent crimes).  In 3% of all handgun crimes,
the victim was wounded.  The offender shot at but missed the victim
in 14% of all handgun crimes.  Victims did not report if offenders
had tried to hit the victim or missed intentionally.

Self-defense with firearms

*38% of the victims defending themselves with a firearm attacked
the offender, and the others threatened the offender with the
weapon.

*A fifth of the victims defending themselves with a firearm
suffered an injury, compared to almost half of those who defended
themselves with weapons other than a firearm or who had no weapon. 
Care should be used in interpreting these data because many aspects
of crimes--including victim and offender characteristics, crime
circumstances, and offender intent--contribute to the victims'
injury outcomes.

*In most cases victims who used firearms to defend themselves or
their property were confronted by offenders who were either unarmed
or armed with weapons other than firearms.  On average between 1987
and 1992, about 35% (or 22,000 per year) of the violent crime
victims defending themselves with a firearm faced an offender who
also had a firearm.  (Because the NCVS collects victimization data
on police officers, its estimates of the use of firearms for
self-defense are likely to include police use of firearms. 
Questionnaire revisions introduced in January 1993 will permit
separate consideration of police and civilian firearm cases.)

Theft of firearms 

*Although most thefts of firearms (64%) occurred during household
burglaries, a significant percentage (32%) occurred during
larcenies.  Loss of firearms through larceny was as likely to occur
away from the victim's home as at or near the home.  In 53% of the
firearm thefts, handguns were stolen.

341,000 incidents of firearm theft occurred per year, 1987-92

                       Average annual number 
                       of victimizations in which
