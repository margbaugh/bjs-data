During 2010, the number of adults under community
supervision declined by 1.3% from 4,954,600 at the beginning
of the year to 4,887,900 at yearend (figure 1). The community
supervision population includes adults on probation and
adults on parole or any other post-prison supervision. (See
text box on page 2.) This represented the second consecutive
decline in the number of adults under community supervision.

The probation population decreased  by 1.7%, which was also
the second consecutive year of decline. The parole
population increased by 0.3%. At yearend 2010, about 1 in 48
adults in the U.S. were under community supervision.

Data in this report were collected through the Bureau of
Justice Statistics'(BJS) Annual Probation Survey and
Annual Parole Survey. Both surveys began in 1980 and collect
data from U.S. probation and parole agencies that supervise
adults. (See text box at the bottom of the page.) In these
data, adults are persons subject to the jurisdiction of an
adult trial court or corrections agency. Juveniles prosecuted
as adults in a criminal court are considered adults.
Respondents are asked to report the number of adults on
probation or parole at the beginning and end of each
reporting year, the number entering and exiting supervision
during the reporting year, characteristics of the populations
at yearend, and other information. The reporting methods
for some probation and parole agencies have changed over
time. (See Methodology.) See appendix tables for
additional 2010 data by jurisdiction.

***********************************************
HIGHLIGHTS

* The number of adult offenders under community
supervision declined by 66,700 during 2010 to reach
4,887,900 offenders at yearend 2010.

* The overall decline in the community supervision
population was due to a 1.7% decline in the probation
population along with a 0.3% increase in the parole
population.

* At yearend 2010, about 4,055,500 adults were on
probation, and during 2010 more than 4.4 million adults
moved onto or off probation.

* Probation entries (2,190,200) declined for the third
consecutive year and probation exits (2,261,300)
declined for the first time since 2006.

* Almost two-thirds (65%) of probationers completed their
terms of supervision or were discharged early during
2010, the same percentage as in 2009.

* The rate of incarceration among probationers at risk of
violating their conditions in 2010 (5.7%) remained at
about the same level observed in 2000 (5.5%).

* At yearend 2010, an estimated 840,700 adults were on
parole, and about 1.1 million offenders moved onto or
off parole during the year. Both parole entries (down
0.5%) and exits (down 1.8%) declined during 2010.

* The state parole population declined by 0.3% during
2010. The number of adults on supervised release in the
federal system increased by 4.9%, which contributed to
the increase in the U.S. parole population.

* The percentage of parolees who completed their terms
or were discharged early during 2010 (52%) was slightly
higher than the level observed for 2009 (51%).

* Among parolees at risk of violating the conditions of their
supervision, about 13% were reincarcerated during 2010, down
from about 16% reincarcerated during 2000.

Community supervision population dropped to the 2004 level

The number of offenders under community supervision during
2010 decreased by 66,700, dropping to slightly fewer than 4.9
million at yearend 2010 (appendix table 1). This was below
the yearend 2004 level.

The probation population declined for the second consecutive
year, reaching about 4.1 million by yearend 2010, a level not
observed since 2003 (figure 2; appendix table 2). Since
probationers account for about 83% of the adults under
community supervision, small percentage changes in the number
of probationers can largely determine the overall growth in
the community supervision population. The decrease (down
69,500) in the probation population during 2010 accounted for
all of the decline in the community supervision population.
The number on parole increased by nearly 2,900 during the
year to reach about 840,700 (figure 3; appendix table 12).

********************************************************
BJS definition of probation and parole

Probation is a court-ordered period of correctional
supervision in the community, generally as an alternative to
incarceration. In some cases, probation can be a combined
sentence of incarceration followed by a period of community
supervision.

Parole is a period of conditional supervised release in the
community following a prison term. It includes parolees
released through discretionary or mandatory supervised
release from prison, those released through other types of
post-custody conditional supervision, and those sentenced to
a term of supervised release.
********************************************************

The decline in the community supervision population from 2008
to 2010 followed the longer-term trend of declining growth
rates in the population. During the 1980s, the number of
adults under community supervision grew by an average of 8.9%
per year, increasing from 1,338,500 offenders at yearend 1980
to 2,977,300 at yearend 1989. The rate of growth in the
community supervision population slowed to about 3.0% per
year on average during the 1990s.***Footnote 1 A portion of
the increase in the probation component of the community
supervision population was due to the expanded coverage
of probation agencies. See Methodology for a discussion on
calculating the growth rate to account for the expanded
coverage of probation.*** Prior to the decline observed
during 2009, the number of offenders under community
supervision increased an average of 1.4% each year, from
4,565,100 at yearend 2000 to 5,095,200 by yearend 2008. Since
2008, this population declined 0.9% during 2009 and 1.3%
during 2010.

The growth in the probation population followed a similar
overall trend, as probationers make up the majority
(83%) of offenders under community supervision. During the
1980s, the probation population increased from 1,118,097
probationers at yearend 1980 to 2,520,479 by yearend 1989.
The 9.0% average rate of growth observed per year during the
1980s was greater than the 3.0% average annual growth rate
observed during the 1990s, when the population increased from
2,670,234 probationers at yearend 1990 to 3,772,773 at
yearend 1999. Growth in the probation population slowed to an
average of about 1.3% per year between 2000 and 2008. After
2008, the number of probationers declined 0.9% during
2009 and 1.7% during 2010.

The parole population also grew more slowly during the 2000s
than during the 1980s and 1990s. Growth in this population
slowed further during 2009 and 2010. Through the 1980s,
the number of parolees increased by an average of about 8.1%
per year, increasing from 220,438 parolees at yearend 1980 to
456,797 by yearend 1989. The growth rate in the parole
population dropped to 3.3% per year between 1990 and 1999.
The rate of growth in the parole population slowed to 1.7%
per year between 2000 and 2008 before declining 0.7% during
2009. The population increased slightly (0.3%) again in 2010.

Rate of offenders under community supervision at yearend 2010
dropped below the 2000 level 

The community supervision rate declined steadily after
reaching a peak of 2,234 probationers or parolees per 100,000
U.S. adult residents at yearend 2007. From 2008 to 2010, the
rate dropped from 2,201 per 100,000 U.S. adult residents to
2,074 offenders per 100,000 (or 1 in every 48 adults in the
U.S.), a rate lower than was observed in 2000 (table 1). The
majority (62%) of the decline in the community supervision
rate from 2007 to 2010 was attributed to the decline in the
number of adults under community supervision. About 38% of
the decline in the community supervision rate was attributed
to the increase in the U.S. adult resident population since
2007 (not shown in table).***Footnote 2 See Methodology for
information about the method used to decompose the decline in
the community supervision rate from 2007 to 2010.***

The changes observed in the supervision rate of probationers
from 2007 to 2010 were similar to the changes observed in the
community supervision rate. About 1,873 probationers per
100,000 U.S. adult residents were under supervision at
yearend 2007. This rate dropped to 1,721 probationers per
100,000 (or 1 in every 58 adults in the U.S.) in 2010, a
rate lower than was observed in 2000. About two-thirds of the
decline in the probationer supervision rate came from the
decrease in the number of adults on probation. About a third
of the decline in the probationer supervision rate came from
the increase in the U.S. adult resident population.

The parolee supervision rate peaked at yearend 2007 with 360
parolees per 100,000 U.S. adult residents. The rate declined
to 358 parolees per 100,000 U.S. adult residents by yearend
2008 and to 351 per 100,000 by yearend 2009. As the parole
population increased slowly during 2010, the parolee rate
increased to 357 parolees per 100,000 U.S. adult residents
(or 1 in every 280 adults in the U.S.). However, the number
of parolees per 100,000 U.S. adult residents was smaller at
yearend 2010 compared to the rate observed in 2007. All of
the decline in the parolee rate observed between 2007 and
2010 was attributed to the increase in the U.S. adult
resident population during that period.

Five states accounted for more than half of the decline in
the probation population

The probation population declined by 69,519 probationers
during 2010, reaching 4,055,514 at yearend. Thirty three
states reported declines in their probation population during
2010, amounting to a total decrease of 99,195 probationers
(table 2). Declines in California, Florida, Minnesota, Texas,
and Maryland accounted for 54% of the total decrease among
states whose probation population declined during 2010.
California (down 18,854 probationers) and Florida (down
11,228) accounted for almost a third of 
the decrease. 

Nineteen jurisdictions Including the District of Columbia and
the federal system--reported increases in their probation
population during 2010, amounting to a total increase of
29,676 probationers. More than half of this increase occurred
in Pennsylvania (up 7,968), Alabama (up 3,312), Georgia (up
3,273), and Arizona (up 2,667).

Entries onto probation were down for the third consecutive
year; exits declined for the first time since 2006 
 
Movements onto and off probation declined during 2010, as
both the number of entries and exits declined during the
year. Exits from probation exceeded the number of entries, as
entries onto probation (down 4.5%) declined at a faster rate
than exits (down 2.8%) during the year. This marked the
third consecutive year of a decrease in the number of entries
to probation and the first decline in exits since 2006.

More than 4.4 million combined movements onto and off
probation supervision occurred during 2010, with the
probation population decreasing by about 69,500 
probationers. *** Footnote 3 The change of about 69,500
probationers was calculated as the difference between the
probation population at the start (on January 1) and end (on
December 31) of 2010, and may be different from the change
calculated as the difference between entries and exits. See
Methodology for more details.***

As entries onto and exits from probation diverge, a larger
change is observed in the probation population while
convergence of entries and exits leads to smaller
changes in the population. During 2010, entries and exits
diverged. This was the second consecutive year in which exits
from probation (2,261,300) exceeded entries (2,190,200)
(figure 4). As entries onto probation declined at a faster
rate than exits from probation during 2010, the second
consecutive decrease in the probation population was
observed.

Offenders on probation completed their supervision terms at
about the same rate in 2010 as in 2009

The rate at which probationers exit supervision--the number
that exit probation divided by the average probation
population at the start and end of the year--provides an
indication of how quickly the population turns over and an
indirect measure of the average time an offender can expect
to spend on probation. About 55 probationers per 100 exited
supervision during 2010 (table 3). This rate has not
changed since 2008. Mean length of stay on probation remained
stable between 2008 (22.0 months) and 2010 (21.7 months).
***Footnote 4 Mean length of stay is calculated as the
inverse of the exit rate times 12 months. See Methodology for
more details.***

Since 2006, the rate of turnover in the probation population
has remained relatively stable, as indicated by small
increases in the probationer exit rate between 2006 (53 per
100) and 2008 (55 per 100) and the lack of change since 2008.

Turnover due to probationers completing the terms of their
supervision, either through a full-term completion or
an early discharge, remained steady from 2009 through 2010
(36 per 100 probationers in each year).

This finding was consistent with the stability observed in
the percentage of probationers who were discharged
after completing the terms of their supervision. Of the
estimated 2,261,300 probationers who exited supervision
during 2010, about 65% were discharged after completing the
terms of their supervision or receiving an early discharge,
unchanged from 2009 (65%) (table 4). Between 2006 (58%) and
2009 (65%), the percentage of probationers who completed
their terms and were discharged increased as exits from
probation increased during this period.

Rate of incarceration among probationers remained steady
during the last year 

During 2010, the rate of incarceration during the year
remained at the 2009 level (5.7% each year) (figure 5). The
rate at which all adults on probation during the year can be
incarcerated is defined as the ratio of the number of
probationers who are discharged during the year as the result
of incarceration to the number of probationers who could have
been incarcerated at any point during the year. The number
who could have been incarcerated equals the sum of the start
of the year population plus entries onto probation. This pool
is defined as those at risk of incarceration. *** Footnote 5
See Methodology for a discussion about the at-risk measure of
incarceration.***The stability in the rate of incarceration,
including  incarceration for a new offense, a revocation, or
other reasons, among probationers during 2010 was consistent
with the relative stability observed since 2000 (5.5%).

Most characteristics of probationers were unchanged during
2010  

Most of the characteristics of the probation population
remained unchanged during 2010 as the population declined.
About three quarters of probationers were male at yearend
2010, while about a quarter were female (appendix table 5).
More than half of the probation population was white, while
30% was black and 13% was Hispanic.

Half of the probation population was under supervision for a
felony at yearend 2010. About 47% were supervised for a
misdemeanor and another 2% were supervised for other
infractions.***Footnote 6 Detail may not sum to total due to
rounding.***

At yearend 2010, property offenders represented 28% of the
probation population and drug offenders represented 26%.
About 19% of probationers were supervised for a violent
offense, including 3% for a domestic violence offense, 3% for
a sex offense, and 12% for other violent offenses. Another
18% of probationers were supervised for a public-order
offense, including 15% for driving while intoxicated or under
the influence and 3% for other traffic offenses.

U.S. parole population rose during 2010; state parole
population dropped for the second consecutive year 

The U.S. parole population increased by 2,858 parolees during
2010, reaching 840,676 at yearend. The 0.3% growth in the
U.S. parole population masked a decline of 0.3% (down 2,096)
in the number of parolees under state authority during 2010.
This marked the second consecutive year that the state
parole population decreased (down 1.5% or 10,758 parolees in
2009).

The increase of 4,954 in the number of offenders on
supervised release reported by the federal system during
2010 was the largest increase in the number of parolees
observed in the nation (table 5). This marked the third
consecutive year that the federal system reported the largest
increase in the number of parolees in the U.S. Since 2008 (up
7.9%), the rate of growth in the federal population has
slowed (up 5.4% in 2009 and up 4.9% in 2010) (not shown in
table).

In 2010, 19 states reported declines in their parole
populations totaling 14,706 parolees. Two states, Illinois
and Ohio, accounted for about two-thirds of the total
decrease. In 31 states and the District of Columbia, the
parole populations increased by a total of 12,610 parolees.
Four states, Louisiana, Kentucky, Georgia, and Mississippi,
accounted for more than half of the total increase.    

Entries to parole exceeded exits during 2010 as exits dropped
at a greater rate than entries 

Both the number of adult offenders entering parole (565,300)
and exiting parole (562,500) declined during 2010 (figure 6).
The decline in entries to parole was consistent with the
decrease observed in the number of prisoners released from
state or federal jurisdiction during the year, including a
decrease in the number of prisoners conditionally released to
community supervision. (See Prisoners in 2010, BJS Web, NCJ
236096, forthcoming.)

More than 1.1 million combined movements onto and off parole
supervision occurred during 2010, with the parole population
increasing by about 2,900 parolees. While both parole entries
and exits declined during 2010, the rate of decline in exits
(down 1.8%) was faster than the rate of decline in entries
(down 0.5%), resulting in fewer exits from parole compared to
the number of parolees that entered supervision. This led to
an increase in the U.S. parole population during 2010.

Mandatory releases from prison were a smaller portion of
entries to parole in 2010 compared to 2009

About 51% of parolees who entered supervision during 2010
entered through a mandatory release from prison, down from
53% in 2009 (figure 7). While the portion of all types of
entries to parole have fluctuated slightly over time since
2000, mandatory releases to parole have remained the
most common type.

While mandatory releases to parole declined during the
previous year, parolees who entered supervision through a
discretionary release by a parole board comprised a slightly
larger portion of entries to parole during 2010 (28%)
compared to 2009 (27%). Parolees who had their parole
reinstated also accounted for a slightly larger share
of parole entries during 2010 (9%) compared to 2009 (8%).

During 2010, another 9% of parolees entered through a term of
supervised release, up slightly from 8% in 2010.*** Footnote
7 The estimates of term of supervised release reflect only
data reported by the federal system. See Methodology for more
details.*** About 3% of parolees entered through another type
of sentence during 2010, unchanged from 2009.

*****************************************************
Type of post-prison supervision in the federal system

The BJS definition of parole in this report includes all
types of post-prison supervision in the federal system,
including a term of supervised release, mandatory release,
parole, special parole, and military parole. In the federal
system, a term of supervised release is a sentence to a fixed
period of supervision in the community that follows a
sentence to a period of incarceration in federal prison. Both
are ordered at the time of sentencing by a federal judge.

Of the 47,873 offenders released from federal prison to post-
prison supervision during 2010, as reported to BJS through
the Annual Parole Survey, the large majority (46,684 or 98%)
were released to supervision through a term of supervised
release, while fewer offenders were released through a
discretionary (628) or mandatory (515) release from federal
prison and even fewer had their original post-prison
supervision sentence reinstated (46). Similarly, of the
105,552 federal offenders on some form of post-prison
supervision at yearend 2010, the large majority were
sentenced to a term of supervised release in the community
(103,423 or 98%) while fewer were supervised after a
discretionary (1,989) or mandatory (140) release from federal
prison. See appendix tables 13 and 21 for detailed data and
Methodology for more details.
*****************************************************

Parole completion rate increased during 2010, continuing a
trend observed since 2006 Between 2009 (70 per 100 parolees)
and 2010 (67 per 100), the turnover rate of the parole
population declined to the level observed in 2006 (67 per
100) (table 6). The mean length of stay remained relatively
constant between 2006 (18.0 months) and 2010  (17.9). ***
Footnote 8 Mean length of stay is calculated as the inverse
of the exit rate times 12 months. See Methodology for
more details.*** 

Contributing to the decline in the turnover of the parole
population was a decline in the rate of parolees that exited
supervision and returned to parolees) and 2010 (22 per 100).
This decline continued a trend that has been observed since
2006 (26 per 100). 

In 2010, 35 per 100 parolees completed the terms of their
supervision or received an early discharge compared to 29 per
100 parolees in 2006. This finding was consistent with the
increase between 2006 and 2010 in the percentage of parolees
who completed the terms of their supervision and were
discharged. Of the estimated 562,500 parolees that exited
supervision during 2010, about 52% completed their terms or
received an early discharge, up slightly from 51% of parole
exits during 2009 and 45% of parole exits during 2006 (table
7).

Rate of reincarceration among parolees declined during 2010

During 2010, about 13% of all parolees who were at risk of
reincarceration were incarcerated. This was down from about
16% reincarcerated during 2000 (figure 8). The rate at which
all offenders on parole during the year could be incarcerated
is defined as the ratio of the number of parolees who were
discharged during the year as a result of incarceration to
the number of parolees who could have been incarcerated at
any point during the year. The number who could have been
incarcerated equals the sum at the start of the year
population plus entries onto parole during the year. This
pool is defined as those at risk of incarceration.

Contributing to the overall decline in the rate of
reincarceration was a corresponding decrease in the rate at
which parolees returned to incarceration as the result of a
revocation between 2000 (12%) and 2010 (9%). The rate at
which parolees returned to incarceration for a new offense
remained stable at about 4% between 2009 and 2010.

Most characteristics of parolees were unchanged during 2010

Most of the characteristics of the parole population remained
unchanged during 2010. The parole population was
predominantly male (88%) at yearend 2010 (appendix table 15).
White parolees represented 42% of the parole population,
while black (39%) and Hispanic (18%) parolees represented a
smaller share.

At yearend 2010, the large majority (95%) of the parole
population had been sentenced to incarceration for more
than one year. The most common type of offense in which
parolees were under supervision was a drug offense (35%).
Twenty-seven percent of the population was on parole after
serving a sentence for a violent offense, including 8% for
a sex offense and 19% for other violent for a property
offense.

While most of the characteristics of the parole population
remained unchanged, some changes were observed during 2010.
Active supervision requires parolees to report regularly to a
parole authority in person, by mail, or by telephone. This
type of supervision decreased as a percentage of all
parolees, from 85% in 2009 to 82% in 2010. A corresponding
increase in the percentage of parolees on inactive status,
excluded from regular reporting but still on parole, was
observed between 2009(4%) and 2010 (7%).

Most of the change in active and inactive parole supervision
status can be attributed to changes in the status of parolees
supervised in California. While California's parole 
population experienced a small decrease between yearend 2009
(106,035) and 2010 (105,133), California reported fewer
parolees on active status in 2010 (89,178) compared to 2009
(106,035) (appendix table 18). A corresponding increase in
the number of parolees on inactive status was observed in
California during the last year (0 in 2009 to 15,955 in
2010). This change was related to a California law that went
into effect in January 2010 that required parolees who meet
specific criteria to be placed on non-revocable parole.
These parolees on non-revocable parole meet BJS's definition
of inactive status because they are excluded from regular
reporting but are still on parole.*** Footnote 9 See Parole:
Explanatory notes about California for more details.***

Methodology

The Bureau of Justice Statistics' (BJS) Annual Probation
Survey and Annual Parole Survey began in 1980 and collect
data from probation and parole agencies in the U.S. that
supervise adults. In these data, adults are persons subject
to the jurisdiction of an adult court or correctional agency.
Juveniles prosecuted as adults in a criminal court are
considered adults. Juveniles under the jurisdiction of a
juvenile court or correctional agency are excluded from
these data. The National Criminal Justice Information and
Statistics Service of the Law Enforcement Assistance
Administration, BJS's predecessor agency, began a statistical
series on parole in 1976 and on probation in 1979.

The two surveys collect data on the total number of adults
supervised in the community on January 1 and December 31 each
year, the number of adults who enter and exit supervision
during the reporting year, and characteristics of the
population at yearend. See appendix tables for detailed data.

Both surveys cover all 50 states, the District of Columbia,
and the federal system. BJS depends on the voluntary
participation of state central reporters and separate state,
county, and court agencies for these data.

In 2010 the U.S. Census Bureau served as BJS's collection
agent for the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
Data for the federal system were provided directly to BJS
from the Office of Probation and Pretrial Services,
Administrative Office of the United States Courts through the
Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP).

Probation

The 2010 Annual Probation Survey was sent to 465 respondents:
34 central state reporters, including the state probation
agency in Pennsylvania, which also provided data for the 65
counties in Pennsylvania; 429 separate state, county, or
court agencies; the District of Columbia; and the federal
system. States with multiple reporters were Alabama (3),
Arizona (2), Colorado (8), Florida (41), Georgia (2), Idaho
(2), Kentucky (3), Michigan (134), Missouri (2), Montana (4),
New Mexico (2), Ohio (187), Oklahoma (3), Tennessee (3),
Washington (31), and West Virginia (2).

One locality in Michigan and one locality in Ohio did not
provide data for the 2010 collection. For the locality
in Ohio, the agency's December 31, 2008, population, which
was the last population count provided by this agency, was
used to estimate the January 1 and December 31, 2010,
populations. For the locality in Michigan, the agency's
December 31, 2009, population was used to estimate the
agency's January 1 and December 31, 2010, populations.

Parole

The 2010 Annual Parole Survey was sent to 55 respondents: 51
central state reporters, including the state parole agency in
Pennsylvania, which also provided data for the 65 counties in
Pennsylvania; one municipal agency in Alabama; the District
of Columbia, the federal system through BJS's FJSP; and the
Division of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) within the California
Department of Correction and Rehabilitation. DJJ (formerly
the California Youth Authority) provides data on parolees who
were under the age of 18 at the time of their offense but
were prosecuted as an adult (i.e., in an adult trial court)
and sentenced to and paroled from a DJJ facility. States with
multiple reporters were Alabama (2) and California (2). 

Federal supervised release (as defined here) includes a term
of supervised release from prison, mandatory release, parole,
military parole, and special parole. A term of supervised
release is ordered at the time of sentencing by a federal
judge, and it is served after release from a federal prison.
These data are based on the calendar year and may differ for
the federal data reported in other BJS statistical series
(that are based on the fiscal year).

Additional information about the data collection instruments
is available at http://www.bjs.gov.

Population counts reflect data reported by probation and
parole agencies within the specific reporting year

Respondents are asked to report the number of adults
supervised on probation or parole at the beginning and
end of each reporting year, the number entering and exiting
supervision during the reporting year, and characteristics
of the populations at yearend, as well as other information.
Some agencies update their probation and parole data after
submitting their data to BJS. Updated data typically include
data that were not entered into the information system until
after the survey was submitted or data that were not fully
processed by yearend. Agencies also experience changes in
reporting methods over time. (See Some reporting methods
changed among parole agencies within certain jurisdictions
from 2000 to 2010 and Some reporting methods changed among
probation agencies within certain jurisdictions from 2000 to
2010.)

Data in this report reflect the data reported by the
probation and parole agencies within the reporting year.
Therefore, population counts on January 1 of the current year
may differ slightly from population counts on December 31 of
the prior reporting year. For this reason, annual change is
calculated within the reporting year. For example, the annual
change during 2010 that is included in figures 1 through 3 is
the difference between the January 1 and December 31, 2010,
populations.

Total community supervision counts were adjusted to account
for offenders with dual community correctional status 

Some offenders on probation or parole may have dual community
correctional statuses because they were serving separate
probation and parole sentences concurrently. With the yearend
2007 data, BJS began collecting data on the number of
parolees who were also on probation at yearend. The total
community supervision populations from 2008 through 2010
reported in figure 1 (and the 2010 counts in appendix table
1) have been adjusted based on available information to
account for dual statuses. As a result, the probation and
parole counts for 2008 through 2010 will not sum to the total
community supervision population within the same year.

All of the estimates of parolees with dual community
correctional statuses are based on data reported by parole
agencies that were capable of providing the information for
the reporting year (table 8). Since some parole agencies
were not capable of providing these data, the total number of
parolees also on probation from 2008 to 2010 may be
underestimated.

Some reporting methods changed among probation agencies
within certain jurisdictions from 2000 to 2010

Sixteen reporting agencies in separate jurisdictions changed
their methods of reporting probation data between 2000 and
2010 (table 9). These changes included administrative
changes, such as implementing new information systems,
resulting in data review and cleanup; reconciling probationer
records; reclassifying offenders, including those on
probation to parole and offenders on dual community
supervision statuses; and including certain probation
populations not previously reported (e.g., supervised for an
offense of driving while intoxicated or under the influence,
some probationers who had absconded and some on an inactive
status).

Without adjusting for these reporting changes, the total
change in the probation population between 2000 and 2010 was
an increase of 5.6% or 215,982 probationers (table 10).
When the modified reporting methods are taken into account,
the change in the population during this period was
underestimated by about 54,000 probationers. The adjustment
to the total change in the probation population methods since
2000 results in an increase in the probation population
(7.0%) that is slightly larger than the increase without
adjusting for changes in reporting methods.

See Probation: Explanatory notes for a discussion about the
2010 reporting changes and Probation: Explanatory notes in
Probation and Parole in the United States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ
231674, for a discussion about the reporting changes that
occurred between 2000 and 2009.

Some reporting methods changed among parole agencies within
certain jurisdictions from 2000 to 2010

Reporting agencies in ten jurisdictions changed their methods
of reporting parole data between 2000 and 2010 (table 11).
The reasons for changing their methods of reporting parole
data were the same as for probation data--administrative
changes, reclassification of offenders, and the addition of
certain parole populations not previously reported, which can
result from new, enhanced information systems that improve
the tracking of all types of parolees.

Without adjusting for these reporting changes, the total
change in the parole population between 2000 and 2010 was an
increase of 15.9% or by 115,149 parolees (table 12). When
the modified reporting methods are taken into account, the
total change in the population during this period was
overestimated by about 22,600 parolees. The adjustment to the
total change in the parole population to account for the
modified reporting methods since 2000 results in an increase
in the parole population (12.8%) that is slightly smaller
than the increase without adjusting for changes in reporting
methods.

See Parole: Explanatory notes for a description of the 2010
reporting changes in the following four jurisdictions:
Maryland, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Virginia. See
Parole: Explanatory notes in Probation and Parole in the
United States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674, for a description
of the reporting changes that occurred between 2000 and 2009.

Probation coverage expanded beginning in 1998 through 1999

To address under coverage, the number of probation agencies
was expanded beginning in 1998 and continued through 1999 to
include misdemeanor probation agencies in a few states that
fell within the scope of this survey. In 1998, survey
coverage was expanded to include 35 additional probation
agencies, which accounted for 27,644 additional probationers
beginning with the January 1, 1998, probation population.
Expansion of probation coverage continued through 1999. In
that year, an additional 178 probation agencies were added to
the collection, which accounted for 259,744 additional
probationers beginning with the January 1, 1999, probation
population.

The December 31, 1999, community supervision and probation
populations that were used to calculate the average annual
percent change in those populations between 1990 and 1999
were adjusted to exclude the 27,644 probationers added in
1998 and the 259,744 probationers added in 1999.  

Estimating annual change based on population counts within
the reporting year or entries and exits

Technically, the change in the probation and parole
populations from the beginning of the year to the end of
the year should equal the difference between entries and
exits during the year. However, those numbers may not be
equal. Some probation and parole information systems track
the number of cases that enter and exit community
supervision, not the number of offenders. This means that
entries and exits may include case counts as opposed to
counts of offenders, while the beginning and yearend
population counts represent individuals. Additionally, all
the data on entries and exits may not have been logged into
the information systems or the information systems may not
have fully processed all of the data before the data were
submitted to BJS.

At the national level, the discrepancy (269) between the
change (2,993) in the parole population (i.e., the
difference between the January 1 and December 31, 2010,
populations) and the difference (2,724) between parole
entries and exits during 2010 was small. For probation at the
national level, the discrepancy (2,265) between the change
(68,835) in the probation population (i.e., the difference
between January 1 and December 31, 2010, populations) and the
difference (71,100) between probation entries and exits
during 2010 was also minimal.

Estimates of annual change reported in figures 1 through 3
and appendix tables 1, 2, and 12 were calculated as the
difference between the January 1 and December 31 populations
within the reporting year. Estimates of annual change
reported in figures 4 and 6 were calculated as the difference
between entries and exits within the reporting year, where
the focus of the discussion is the impact of entries and
exits on annual change in the populations.

Decomposing the decline in the community supervision,
probation, and parole rates since 2007

To decompose the decline in the community supervision,
probationer, and parolee rates discussed in this report, the
following formula was used:

ŽR = [P1 * (1/GP1)]   [P0 * (1/GP0)]
= [P1 * ((1/GP1) - (1/GP0))] + [(1/GP0)
* (P1   P0)]
= [(1/GP1) * (P1   P0)] + [P0 * ((1/
GP1) - (1/GP0)]

Using the community supervision population as an example, in
this formula, ŽR is the change in the community supervision
rate, P1 is the community supervision population for the most
recent year (4,887,900 in 2010), P0 is the community
supervision probation for the earlier year (5,119,300 in
2007), GP1 is the U.S. adult resident population for the most
recent year (235,693,700 in 2010), and GP0 is the U.S. adult
resident population for the earlier year (229,160,900 in
2007). The components [(1/GP0) * (P1   P0)], which is
[(1/229,160,900) * (4,887,900   5,119,300)], and [(1/GP1) *
(P1   P0)], which is [(1/235,693,700) * (4,887,900   
5,119,300)], provided the change in the community supervision
rate due to the change in the community supervision
population. These two components were summed, and the average
was used to estimate the amount of change in the community
supervision rate attributed to the change in the community
supervision population during that period (from 2007 to
2010). 

The components [P1 * ((1/GP1)   (1/GP0))], which is
[4,887,900 * ((1/235,693,700)   (1/229,160,900))], and [P0 *
((1/GP1)   (1/GP0)], which is [5,119,300 * ((1/235,693,700)  
(1/229,160,900)], provided the change due to the U.S. adult
resident population. These two components were summed, and
the average was used to estimate the amount of change in the
community supervision rate attributed to the change in the
U.S. adult resident population during the period. This
same method was used to decompose the decline in the
probationer and parolee rates between 2007 and 2010.   

Imputing entries and exits for nonreporting probation
agencies in 2010

BJS used three methods of ratio estimation, based on the
availability of data, to impute probation entries for
nonreporting agencies. BJS used a single method to impute
probation exits. All parole agencies reported entries and
exits in 2010; therefore, no parole entries or exits were
imputed by BJS. 

The first method of ratio estimation was used to estimate
entries and exits for probation agencies that were unable to
report these data in 2010, but were able to report these data
in 2009. For these agencies, the number of entries reported
by the agency during 2009 was divided by the agency's
probation population on January 1, 2009. This ratio was
applied to the agency's January 1, 2010, population to
estimate entries for 2010. BJS estimated exits from probation
by adding the agency's estimated probation entries in 2010 to
the agency's probation population on January 1, 2010, and
then subtracting that estimate from the agency's probation
population on December 31, 2010. These methods were used to
estimate probation entries and exits in nonreporting county
and district agencies in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, Ohio,
Rhode Island, and Washington.

A second method of ratio estimation was used to estimate
probation entries for agencies that were unable to report
entries and exits in both 2009 and 2010. Data from reporting
agencies with similar numbers of probationers and within the
same state were used to estimate the number of entries for
the nonreporting agencies during 2010. In this case, the
total number of 2010 entries among the reporting agencies of
similar size was divided by the total January 1, 2010,
population among those agencies. This ratio was applied to
each nonreporting agency's January 1, 2010, population to
estimate entries for that agency during 2010. To estimate
probation exits for these agencies, BJS used the same
estimation method as described in the previous paragraph.
These methods were used to estimate probation entries and
exits for nonreporting county and district agencies in
Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, and Washington.

A third method of ratio estimation was used to estimate
probation entries for one state agency in West Virginia,
which only reported interstate compact data. Data from
reporting agencies within the same region (South) were used
to estimate entries for West Virginia during 2010. The total
number of 2010 entries among the reporting agencies within
the South was divided by the total January, 1, 2010,
population among those reporting agencies. This ratio was
applied to West Virginia's January 1, 2010, population
to estimate entries during 2010. To estimate probation exits
for this agency, BJS used the same estimation method as
previously described.

Changes in estimating national entries and exits from 2000 to
2009

The 2010 reporting year was the first year during the current
decade that Pennsylvania was able to report totals of
probation and parole entries and exits in the Pennsylvania
counties. In previous years, BJS estimated those data and
also made adjustments to the national totals of probation and
parole entries and exits from 2000 to 2007 based on a new
estimation method implemented in 2008. (See Probation and
Parole in the United States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674. See
also Probation and Parole in the United States, 2008, BJS
Web, NCJ228230 for more details.)

To account for the flow data reported by Pennsylvania for the
counties in 2010 and to ensure that the national estimates
of probation and parole entries and exits from 2000 to 2009
were comparable to the 2010 totals, the 2000 to 2009 totals
were re-estimated. The BJS method of estimation implemented
in 2008 was replicated for 2010, and the estimates yielded
were compared to the 2010 totals reported for the
Pennsylvania counties. The difference between the estimates
yielded from the BJS estimation method and the reported
totals for the Pennsylvania counties was used to adjust the
2000 to 2009 national totals. The BJS method of estimation
yielded probation and parole entries and exits for 2010 that
were larger than the reported totals from Pennsylvania;
therefore, the national totals from 2000 to 2009 were
adjusted by subtracting the difference.

The national totals of probation entries from 2000 to 2009
were re-estimated by subtracting the difference of 20,800;
the national totals of probation exits were re-estimated by
subtracting the difference of 20,700. For example, the 2009
national estimate of 2,313,600 probation entries that was
reported in table 2 in Probation and Parole in the United
States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674, was re-estimated by
subtracting 20,800 to yield a revised 2009 estimate of
2,292,800 probation entries that is reported in figure 4 of
this report. The 2009 national estimate of 2,347,500
probation exits that was reported in table 2 in Probation and
Parole in the United States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674, was
re-estimated by subtracting 20,700 to yield a revised 2009
estimate of 2,326,800 probation exits that is reported in
figure 4 of this report.

The national totals of parole entries and exits from 2000 to
2009 that were reported in Probation and Parole in the United
States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674, were re-estimated using
the same method described above, except that a difference of
6,000 was subtracted from both the parole entries and exits
from 2000 to 2009. The revised national totals of parole
entries and exits appear in figure 6 of this report.

Calculating mean length of stay

Mean length of stay is calculated as the inverse of the exit
rate. Patterson and Preston (2007) provide tests of various
methods for estimating expected length of stay and report the
results of simulations that show that under assumptions of a
stationary population with a small growth rate, the inverse
of the exit rate performs well relative to a life-table
approach to estimating mean time served.***Footnote 10 See
Patterson, E.J., & Preston, S.H. (2007).Estimating Mean
Length of Stay in Prison: Methods and Applications. Journal
of Quantitative Criminology 24:33-49.*** Based on the small
growth rates in the probation and parole populations in
recent years, the inverse of the exit rate suffices to
provide an estimate of mean stay on probation or parole in
recent years.

Community supervision outcome measures

Outcome measures based on the number of offenders exiting
supervision 

Historically, BJS has reported the percentage of probationers
and the percentage of parolees who completed supervision and
the percentage of both who were incarcerated, among all
probationers or parolees who exited supervision during the
year, as the community supervision outcome measures.

Because these outcome measures are based on the number of
probationers or parolees exiting supervision (i.e., the
exiting cohort) within the reference year, they are based on
a cohort that comprises different types of probationers or
parolees, including those who completed the terms of
supervision or received an early discharge; were incarcerated
either for a new offense, a revocation, or other reasons;
died; or were discharged for other reasons.

The percentage of probationers and the percentage of parolees
who completed supervision is defined as the number of
supervision during the year and were discharged, among all
probationers or parolees who were discharged from supervision
during the year. The formula used to calculate this outcome
measure is C(t)/D(t), where D(t) = C(t) + I(t) + O(t). In
this formula, t equals the year referenced, C(t) equals the
number of probationers or parolees who were discharged from
supervision during the year after completing their terms or
who received an early discharge, and D(t) equals the total
number who were discharged from supervision during the year.
D(t) includes C(t), the number of offenders who completed
supervision; I(t), the number who were incarcerated during
the year; and O(t), the number who were discharged during the
year for other reasons.

The percentage of probationers and the percentage of parolees
incarcerated is calculated using the formula in the previous
paragraph except the numerator is the number of probationers
or parolees who were discharged from supervision during the
year as the result of being incarcerated.

Outcome measure based on the at-risk population

The rate of incarceration (for parolees this is also referred
to as the rate of return to incarceration or the rate of
reincarceration) based on the at-risk probation or parole
population is defined as the ratio of the number of
probationers or parolees who were discharged from supervision
during the year because they were incarcerated for a new
offense, a revocation, or other reasons, to the number of all
probationers or parolees at risk of being incarcerated during
the year. The at-risk population is defined as the number
of probationers or parolees under supervision at the start of
the year (on January 1) plus the number who entered
supervision during the year. This pool of probationers or
parolees could be incarcerated at any time during the year;
hence, they were at risk of incarceration. The formula used
to calculate this outcome measure is I(t)/(P(t-1) + E(t)),
where t equals the year referenced, P(t-1) equals the start
of the year population, and E(t) equals the number of
probationers or parolees who entered supervision during the
year.

There are distinct differences between the rate of
incarceration measure based on the at-risk population and the
discharge-based outcome measures. First, because both the
discharge-based completion and incarcerated outcome measures
are based on the exiting cohort, the two measures include a
population (i.e., denominator) that has different risk
periods. For example, the exiting cohort includes 
probationers or parolees who exit after completing their
supervision, which can only be achieved after a certain
period of time (i.e., after they serve a specified amount of
time under supervision and/ or fulfill specific conditions of
their supervision), as well as probationers or parolees who
are incarcerated during the year, which can occur at any
point while they are under supervision.

The at-risk measure of incarceration accounts for all
probationers or parolees under supervision during the year
(i.e., probationers or parolees who were those who entered
during the year) who are the probationers or parolees at risk
of being incarcerated. This measure is not limited only to
those who are discharged during the year. Second,
specifically in comparison to the discharge-based completion
rate, the at risk measure of incarceration allows that
each probationer or each parolee can be incarcerated at any
time during the year.

Estimating the national total of offenders under community
supervision incarcerated annually to calculate the national
rate of incarceration among the at-risk populations

BJS defines the rate of incarceration for probationers and
parolees as the ratio of the number of probationers or
parolees who were discharged from supervision during the year
because they were incarcerated to the number at risk of
incarceration. The number at risk of incarceration is the sum
of the number of probationers or parolees at the start of the
year plus the number that entered supervision during the
year. See the section Community supervision outcome measures,
Outcome measure based on at-risk population for more details.

To generate estimates for the numerator of this ratio,
post-stratification weighting methods were used to weight
reporting jurisdictions' data on type of exit, specifically
incarceration. The first weight was defined as the ratio of
each jurisdiction's proportionate contribution exits, which
included all types of exits except those reported as unknown
type, to the jurisdiction's contribution to the national
total of all reported exits, which included all types of
exits including those reported as unknown type. This weighted
total was then weighted up to the BJS total of imputed exits;
total exits were estimated for jurisdictions, or any
reporting agencies within jurisdictions, See the section
Imputing entries and exits for nonreporting probation
agencies in 2010 for more details.

The second weight was defined as the ratio of each
jurisdiction's total imputed exits, which was equal to the
number of total reported exits within the jurisdiction if
total exits were not missing, to the jurisdiction's weighted
total of known reported exits.

The denominator (i.e. the number of probationers or parolees
at the start of the year plus those who entered during the
year) of the rate of incarceration ratio included estimates
generated by BJS for jurisdictions, or any reporting agencies
within jurisdictions, that were not able to report total
entries during the year, which only applied to probation
agencies in 2010. The method used to generate the estimates
is described in the section Imputing entries and exits for
nonreporting agencies in 2010.

Estimates of the national rate of incarceration among the
at-risk probation or parole populations reported in figures
5 and 8, respectively, may be slightly different than the
estimates reported in previous years. As explained in the
section Changes in estimating national entries and exits from
2000 to 2009, Pennsylvania was able to report the total
number of probation and parole entries and exits in the
Pennsylvania counties for the first time in the 2010 
reporting year. In prior years, BJS estimated these data. The
estimates of the national rate of incarceration in this
report reflect adjustments made to the 2000 to 2009 national
total of entries and exits based on the 2010 data reported by
Pennsylvania to account for the difference the totals yielded
through BJS's estimation method. See Changes in estimating
national entries and exits from 2000 to 2009 for more
details.

Generating national estimates of type of entry to parole for
2000 through 2010

In 2008, the Annual Parole Survey included a new category for
type of entry to parole that is labeled term of supervised
release (TSR). It is defined as a fixed period of release to
the community that follows a sentence to incarceration; both
are determined by a judge at the time of sentencing. The
new category was added to better classify the large majority
of entries to parole reported by the federal system. (Of the
total 47,873 offenders that entered federal supervision
following incarceration during 2010, about 46,684 entered
through a term of supervised release.)

In order to analyze the national trends for all types of
entry to parole from 2000 to 2010, BJS generated federal
estimates of TSR from 2000 to 2007. For years 2004 through
2007, BJS was informed by the federal respondent that
TSR was included in other; therefore, the counts reported in
this category were reclassified into TSR. To generate federal
estimates of TSR from 2000 to 2003, BJS used data from the
federal judiciary that were publicly available on the United
States Courts Website at http://www.uscourts.gov/Statistics/
StatisticalTablesForTheFederalJudiciary. aspx. The website
provided counts of the total number of federal offenders
placed on supervised release, by type of entry including TSR.
BJS was informed by the federal respondent that from 2000
to 2003, TSR had been reported in the category for
discretionary releases. BJS used the method of ratio
estimation, based on the data from the federal judiciary, to
generate an estimate of TSR and to re-estimate discretionary
entries to federal parole from 2000 to 2003.

Some states began reporting TSR as a type of entry to parole
in 2008 when the category was added to the survey. Because
TSR data from 2000 to 2007 in those states was not readily
available to BJS and to ensure comparability  over time, BJS
reclassified the TSR data reported by the states into the
mandatory release category. This decision was based on the
fact that mandatory release and TSR are similar in that they
are both are based on determinate sentencing statutes. Also,
BJS compared the entry data reported by those states in 2007,
when TSR was not included on the survey, with their 2008
entry data. It was apparent that in 2007, almost all of those
states that reported TSR data in 2008 had reported them as
mandatory releases in 2007 and prior years.

In general, the number of mandatory releases in those states
between 2007 and 2008 dropped substantially when TSR was
included as a category. Therefore, the estimates of TSR
reported in figure 7 of this report represent federal data
only, including federal estimates of TSR generated by BJS
from 2000 through 2007. The national estimates of mandatory
release from 2008 to 2010 include the TSR data reported by
some states. (The total TSR count reported by the states in
2010 represented about 13% of all mandatory releases to
parole in 2010.)

Estimating 2007 and 2008 community supervision and prison
data for nonreporting jurisdictions

In 2007, Oklahoma could not provide community supervision
data. Community supervision data for Oklahoma were estimated
by BJS; see Probation and Parole in the United States, 2007-
Statistical Tables, BJS Web, NCJ 224707. Virginia could not
provide parole data for January 1, 2008, although Virginia
did provide parole data for December 31, 2008. BJS estimated
Virginia's January 1, 2008, parole population. See Probation
and Parole in the United States, 2008, BJS Web, NCJ 228230.

Estimating the U.S. adult resident population

Supervision rates for the years 2005 through 2010 were
calculated using preliminary estimates of the U.S. adult
resident population in each state on January 1 of each
subsequent year, which were provided to BJS by the U.S.
Census Bureau. The July 1 U.S. adult resident populations
within the reporting year were used to calculate supervision
rates from 2000 through 2004 because those were the only data
available at the time those annual reports were published.

Probation: Explanatory notes

Federal--data for the federal system were provided to BJS
through the FJSP, which obtained data directly from the
Office of Probation and Pretrial Services, Administrative
Office of the United States Courts.

Alabama--has three reporting agencies--one state agency,
representing 89% of Alabama's total probation population, and
two local agencies. Alabama's total probation population
on December 31, 2010, includes an additional 4,233
probationers supervised for another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix table 2).

Reporting changes between 2000 and 2009--for changes in
reporting methods that occurred in Alabama in 2006, see
Methodology and Probation and Parole in the United States,
2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674.

Alaska--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
excludes an unknown number of probationers supervised by
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix tables 2 and 8).

Arizona--has two reporting agencies--one state agency,
representing 97% of Arizona's total probation population,
and one local agency. Arizona's total probation population on
December 31, 2010, includes an additional estimated 1,381
probationers supervised for another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix table 2).

Colorado--has eight reporting agencies--one state agency,
representing 88% of Colorado's total probation population,
and seven local agencies. on December 31, 2010, excludes 31
probationers supervised by another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix tables 2 and 8).
The population includes an additional estimated 1,349
probationers supervised for another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix table 2).

Reporting changes between 2000 and 2009--for changes in
reporting methods that occurred in Colorado in 2009, see
Methodology and Probation and Parole in the United States,
2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674.

Connecticut--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
includes an estimated additional 975 probationers supervised
for another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2).

Delaware--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 775 probationers supervised for
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2).

District of Columbia--reporting changes between 2000 and
2009--for changes in reporting methods that occurred in the
District of Columbia in 2008, see Methodology and Probation
and Parole in the United States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674.

Florida--has 41 reporting agencies--one state agency,
representing 67% of Florida's total probation population,
and 40 local agencies. Florida's total probation population
on December 31, 2010, includes an additional 365 probationers
supervised for another agreement (appendix table 2).

Georgia--has two state reporting agencies. One agency
reported probationers under the jurisdiction of the state,
representing 47% of Georgia's total probation population, an
increase from the 39% reported for 2009. The second agency
reported probationers under the jurisdiction of the counties,
including county probationers who were under supervision for
a misdemeanor and supervised by private probation agencies.
The county probation population represented 53% of Georgia's
total probation population for 2010. Because the agency that
reports the county data has the capacity to report probation
cases and not the number of individuals under supervision,
the counts may overstate the number of individuals under
probation supervision in Georgia. Probationers with multiple
sentences could potentially have one or more cases with one
or more private probation agencies in one jurisdiction and/or
one or more private probation agencies within jurisdictions.

Georgia's total probation population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional unknown number of probationers
supervised for another state through an interstate compact
agreement (appendix table 2). Absconder represents absconders
under state jurisdiction who were also on warrant status.
Warrant status represents only probationers under county
jurisdiction (appendix table 8).

Reporting changes between 2000 and 2009--for changes in
reporting methods that occurred in Georgia between 2007 and
2009, see Methodology and Probation and Parole in the United
States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674. 

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data reported by
Georgia for 2010 are not comparable to those reported for
2009. Georgia changed its method of reporting starting with
the January 1, 2010, population as the result of changes made
by the agency that reported probationers under the
jurisdiction of the state. Changes included more complete
reporting of absconders, conversion to a new data processing
system, and data cleaning. The total change in Georgia's
probation population was an increase of 61,199 probationers
on January 1, 2010(453,887) compared to the population for
December 31, 2009 (392,688). Data reported for Georgia for
2010 are not comparable to the data reported for Georgia in
prior years.

Hawaii--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 181 probationers supervised for
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2). A total of 3,465 probationers whose
offense was classified as a petty misdemeanor on December 31,
2010, were included among misdemeanants for 2010; petty
misdemeanants were included in other for 2009 (appendix table
9).

Idaho--has two state reporting agencies. One agency reported
probationers under the jurisdiction of the state,
representing 29% of Idaho's total probation population. The
second agency reported probationers under the jurisdiction of
the counties and under supervision for a misdemeanor. The
county probation population represented 71% of Idaho's total
probation population.

Additionally, this second Idaho agency only has the capacity
to report the number of probationers who entered county
supervision for a misdemeanor during 2010. The respondent was
able to provide an estimate of time served on misdemeanor
probation within the counties, which was estimated at one
year or less. With this additional information and through
correspondence with the respondent, the December 31, 2010,
population was estimated based on the total number of
probationers who entered county supervision for a misdemeanor
during 2010. Exits from county misdemeanant probation during
2010 were based on the January 1, 2010, population or the
number of probationers who entered county supervision for a
misdemeanor during 2009 (appendix table 2). Idaho's total
probation population on December 31, 2010, includes an
additional 423 probationers supervised for another state
through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table 2).
About 55% of the probationers who were under county
supervision for a misdemeanor were on unsupervised
supervision and were not required to report regularly to a
probation authority in person, by mail, or by telephone;
these have been reported as inactive (appendix table 8).

Illinois--the total probation population on December 31,
2010, includes an additional unknown number of probationers
supervised for another state through an interstate compact
agreement (appendix table 2). 

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--probation data
reported by Illinois for 2010 are not comparable to those
reported for 2009, as the result of changes in reporting by
individual counties that provided data to the state agency.
The total change in Illinois' probation population was a
decrease of 13,782 probationers on January 1, 2010 (130,910),
compared to the population reported for December 31, 2009
(144,692) (appendix table 2).

Indiana--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
excludes an unknown number of probationers supervised by
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix tables 2 and 8). Indiana's total probation
population on December 31, 2010, also includes an unknown
number of probationers supervised for another state through
an interstate compact agreement (appendix table 2).

Iowa--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
excludes 748 probationers supervised by another state through
an interstate compact agreement (appendix tables 2 and 8).

Kansas--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 418 probationers supervised for
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2).

Kentucky--has three reporting agencies--one state agency,
representing 56% of Kentucky's total probation population,
and two local agencies. Kentucky's total probation population
on December 31, 2010, includes an additional 2,073
probationers supervised for another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix table 2).

Louisiana--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 2,215 probationers supervised for
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2).

Maine--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 214 probationers supervised for
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2).

Maryland--the total probation population on December 31,
2010, includes an additional 2,859 probationers supervised
for another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2). 

Reporting changes between 2000 and 2009--for changes in
reporting methods that occurred in Maryland in 2007, see
Probation and Parole in the United States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ
231674. 

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data reported by
Maryland for 2010 are not comparable to those reported for
2009, as the result of changes to its database and processing
methods. Methods used by Maryland to prepare its probation
data for 2010 were comparable to methods used prior to 2009
(appendix tables 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11). The total change in
Maryland's probation population was a decrease of 9,542
probationers on January 1, 2010 (95,017), compared to that
reported for December 31, 2009 (104,541).

Massachusetts--total probation population on December 31,
2010, excludes 904 probationers supervised by another state
through an interstate compact agreement (appendix tables 2
and 8).

Reporting changes between 2000 and 2009--for changes in
reporting methods that occurred in Massachusetts in 2003 and
2004, see Methodology and Probation and Parole in the United
States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674. 

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data reported by
Massachusetts for 2010 are not comparable to those reported
for 2009, due to reporting changes made for 2010. The
estimated January 1 and December 31, 2010, probation
populations represent counts of the number of adults on
probation on a single day. In contrast, the December 31,
2009, probation population included adults who had been on
probation at any time during 2009. The total change in the
Massachusetts probation population was a decrease of 104,428
probationers on January 1, 2010 (76,249), compared to the
population reported for December 31, 2009 (180,677) (appendix
table 2).

Michigan--has 134 agencies--one state agency, representing
38% of Michigan's total probation population, 133 reporting
local agencies, and one local agency that did not report. The
adult probation population on December 31, 2009, of the
nonreporting agency was used as an estimate of the agency's
probation population on both January 1 and December 31, 2010.

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data reported by
Michigan for 2010 are not comparable to those reported for
2009, as the result of reporting changes made by Michigan's
state agency. Changes for 2010 include the reporting of
offenders on absconder and warrant status, and the exclusion
of probationers supervised for other states. Other
undetermined differences in procedures did not permit the
state agency to reconcile the count it provided for January
1, 2010 with what it previously reported for December 31,
2009 (appendix tables 2 and 8). The total change in the
Michigan probation population was an increase of 10,285
probationers on January 1, 2010 (185,416), compared to the
population reported for December 31, 2009 (175,131) (appendix
table 2).

Minnesota--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 1,216 probationers supervised for
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2).

Missouri--has two reporting agencies--one state agency,
representing about 99% of Missouri's total probation
population, and one local agency (appendix table 2).

Montana--has four reporting agencies one state agency,
representing 94% of Montana's total probation population, and
three local agencies (appendix table 2).

Nebraska--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 424 probationers supervised for
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2).

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data reported by
Nebraska for 2010 are not comparable to those reported for
2009, as the result of the implementation of a new data
system in August 2010, which included extensive corrections
to probation records. The total change in Nebraska's
probation population was a decrease of 1,088 probationers on
January 1, 2010 (17,583), compared to the population
reported for December 31, 2009 (18,591) (appendix table 2).

New Hampshire--total probation population on December 31,
2010, includes an additional 490 probationers supervised for
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2).

New Mexico--has two reporting agencies one state agency,
representing 75% of New Mexico's total probation
population, and one local agency. New Mexico's total
probation population on December 31, 2010, includes
an additional unknown number of probationers supervised for
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2).

reporting methods that occurred in New Mexico in 2003,
and from 2006 to 2007, see Methodology and Probation and
Parole in the United States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674.

changes in reporting methods that occurred in New York in
2003, see Methodology and Probation and Parole in the United
States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674.

Ohio--has 187 reporting agencies--one state agency,
representing 5% of Ohio's total probation population,
185 reporting local agencies, and one local agency that did
not report. One local probation agency did not provide
data for 2010. The December 31, 2008, probation population
reported by this agency in 2008 was used as an estimate
of this agency's January 1 and December 31, 2010, probation
populations. Ohio's total probation population on December
31, 2010, excludes an estimate of at least 8 probationers
supervised by another state through an interstate compact
agreement and an unspecified number of probationers on an
inactive status (appendix tables 2 and 8). Ohio's total
probation population on December 31, 2010, includes an
estimate of at least 102 probationers supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
2).

Oklahoma--has three reporting agencies--one state agency,
representing 80% of Oklahoma's total probation population,
and two local agencies (appendix table 2).

Pennsylvania--technically, Pennsylvania has one reporting
agency, which is the state agency. The state agency reports
both state and county data. However, the county data are
reported separately from the state data. The state probation
population represented 3% of Pennsylvania's total probation
population, while the county probation population represented
97% (appendix table 2).

Reporting changes between 2000 and2009--for changes in
reporting methods that occurred in Pennsylvania in 2004,
see Methodology and Probation and Parole in the United
States, 2009, BJSWeb, NCJ 231674.

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data reported by
Pennsylvania for 2010 are not comparable to those
reported for 2009. Pennsylvania changed its method of
reporting county probation data starting with the January
1, 2010 population, to exclude some parolees that had
previously been classified and reported as probationers.
The total change in Pennsylvania's probation population was a
decrease of 20,902 probationers on January 1, 2010
(171,329), compared to the population reported for December
31, 2009 (192,231) (appendix tables 2, 3, and 4).

Rhode Island--Rhode Island's information system classifies
Hispanic or Latino as a race rather than an ethnicity;
therefore, probationers reported as Hispanic or Latino may
also be of another race. In addition, probationers reported
among other racial categories may also be Hispanic or Latino.
Rhode Island's information system does not 24 Probation and
Parole in the United States , 2010 include a racial category
for Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander or two or more
races (appendix table 7).Active includes an unspecified
number of probationers in residential/other treatment program
because they could not be reported separately. Inactive
includes an unspecified number of probationers who were an
absconder because they could not be reported separately, and
2,104 probationers incarcerated in state or federal prison
(appendix table 8). See Incarcerated-Prison in appendix table
11.

South Carolina--reporting changes between 2009 and 2010 data
reported by South Carolina for 2010 are not comparable to
those reported for 2009, as the result of a change in South
Carolina's procedures for processing probation data starting
with the January 1, 2010, population. The total change in
South Carolina's probation population was a decrease of 5,812
probationers on January 1, 2010 (33,876), compared to
the population reported for December 31, 2009 (39,688)
(appendix table 2).

Tennessee--has three reporting agencies--one state agency,
representing 88% of Tennessee's total probation population,
and two local agencies. The population includes an additional
3,222 probationers supervised for another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix table 2).

Texas--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 4,328 probationers supervised for
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2).

Vermont--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
excludes an estimated 14 probationers supervised by another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix
tables 2, 8). The population includes an estimated 213
probationers supervised for another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix table 2). Vermont's
information system does not include a racial category for
Hispanic or Latino and does not collect any ethnicity data;
therefore, the number of Hispanic or Latino probationers
could not be reported and whether other racial categories
include Hispanic or Latino probationer could not be
determined. Vermont's information system also does not
include a racial category for Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific
Islander or two or more races (appendix table 7).

Virginia--the total probation population on December 31,
2010, includes an additional 1,585 probationers supervised
for another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2). Location tracked by GPS - Total and sex
offenders excludes an unspecified number of low level
probationers tracked using dial-in voice recognition
technology (appendix table 11).

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data reported by
Virginia for 2010 are not comparable to those reported for
2009. Virginia changed its method of reporting probation
data starting with the January 1, 2010, population, as the
result of the implementation of the Virginia Corrections
Information System (VACORIS) and the rebuilding of the
offender population data used for analysis. The rebuilt data
adheres to documented data definitions and better reflects
actual population figures than previously released data. The
total change in Virginia's probation population was an
increase of 2,231 probationers on January 1, 2010 (57,876),
compared to the population reported for December 31, 2009
(55,645) (appendix table 2).

Washington--has 31 reporting agencies one state agency,
representing 14% of Washington's total probation
population, and 30 local agencies. Washington's total
probation population on December 31, 2010, excludes 26
probationers supervised by another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix tables 2 and 8).
The population includes an additional unknown number of
probationers supervised by another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix table 2).

Reporting changes between 2000 and 2009--for changes in
reporting methods that occurred in Washington in 2004,
see Methodology and Probation and Parole in the United
States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674.

West Virginia--has two state reporting agencies. One state
agency represented 97% of West Virginia's total probation
population and reported all probationers under the
jurisdiction of the state except some probationers supervised
by another state through an interstate compact agreement.
This agency does not have jurisdiction over those
probationers. The second state agency has jurisdiction over
probationers supervised out of state through an interstate
compact agreement, and this agency only reported those
probationers (appendix table 2).

Wisconsin--Asian includes an unspecified number of
probationers who were Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander
because Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander could not be
reported separately (appendixtable 7).

Wyoming--total probation population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 241 probationers supervised for
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix table 2).

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data reported by
Wyoming for 2010 are not comparable to those reported for
2009, as the result of a conversion to a new data processing
system, and data cleaning. The total change in Wyoming's
probation population was an increase of 684 probationers on
January 1, 2010 (5,352), compared to the population reported
for December 31, 2009 (4,668).

Parole: Explanatory notes

Federal--data for the federal system were provided to BJS
through the FJSP, which obtained data directly from the
Office of Probation and Pretrial Services, Administrative
Office of the United States Courts. Federal supervised
release (as defined here) includes a term of supervised
release from prison, mandatory release, parole, military
parole, and special parole. These data are based on the
calendar year and may differ for the federal data reported in
other BJS statistical series. For example, FJSP data were
based on the fiscal year.

Alabama--has two reporting agencies--one state agency,
representing about 99% of Alabama's total parole population,
and one local agency. Alabama's total parole population
on December 31, 2010, includes an additional 990 parolees
supervised for another state through an interstate compact
agreement (appendix table 12).

Arizona--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 515 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12).

California--has two reporting agencies one state agency,
representing about 99% of California's total parole
population, and the California Division of Juvenile Justice
(DJJ). 

California's total parole population on December 31, 2010,
excludes 757 parolees supervised out of state through
an interstate compact agreement and 13,395 absconders
(appendix table 12). Inactive includes persons on
nonrevocable parole (appendix table 18). For more information
on non-revocable parole in California, including the
eligibility criteria, visit the California Department of
Corrections and Rehabilitation website at http://www.
cdcr.ca.gov/Parole/Non_Revocable_Parole/index.html.

The population on December 31, 2010, includes an additional
1,478 parolees supervised for another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix table 12). Native
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander includes an unspecified
number of Filipino parolees who were classified as Pacific
Islander rather than Asian (appendix table 17). Mandatory
includes a small unspecified number of parolees who received
a discretionary release from prison (appendix table 21).
Location tracked by GPS - Total and sex offenders excludes a
small unknown number of parolees tracked by the DJJ (appendix
table 22).

Colorado--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 304 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12). These methods are not comparable to those used between
2005 and 2008. Entries to parole by reinstatement were
previously classified as mandatory entries to parole
(appendix table 13). Mandatory releases have increased since
2009 as the result of a legislative revision that went into
effect July 1, 2009, that allows certain offenders to earn
additional reductions in time. The 1,980 parolees reported as
supervised out of state includes an unspecified number
of parolees released to a detainer for other charges and some
who were detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) agency for deportation (appendix table 18).

Connecticut--more than one year includes parolees with a
maximum sentence to incarceration of more than two years
because Connecticut statute stipulates that parole eligible
sentences are sentences of more than two years(appendix table
19).

Delaware--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 167 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12).

Florida--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 26 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12).

Georgia--number of parolees reported in death is an
underestimate of the number of parolees who died while on
parole during 2010. Parolees who died are reported as part of
Georgia's parole population until the death certificate is
received. Then, the parolee is discharged as of the day the
death occurred (appendix table 14). Incarcerated - Prison
includes parole violators who were held in short-term
correctional facilities but were still on parole, some of
whom were attending programs (appendix table 22). 

Hawaii--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 48 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12). Hawaii reported absconder, supervised out of state, and
other supervision statuses separately from active status to
meet BJS definitions; however, Hawaii considers these
statuses to be active.

Idaho--total parole population on December 31, 2010, includes
an additional 151 parolees supervised for another state
through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table 12).

Indiana--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
excludes 562 parolees supervised by another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix tables 12 and 18).

Iowa--total parole population on December 31, 2010, excludes
202 parolees supervised by another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix tables 12 and 18).

Kansas--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
excludes 178 absconders (appendix tables 12 and 18). The
Kansas Sentencing Guidelines Act with its determinate
sentencing structure became effective July 1, 1993.
Previously, Kansas had indeterminate sentencing. As a result,
a number of entries to parole involved offenders with
guidelines or new law sentences (which have determinate
periods of post-incarceration supervision). In 2007 and
previous years, it was not possible for Kansas to
differentiate between entries to parole of old law and new
law offenders. For example, releases to post-incarceration
supervision (for a determinate period under new law) were
included with regular parole releases (for an indeterminate
period under old law) in discretionary entries to parole. For
these reasons, types of entries to parole reported by Kansas
in 2007 and previous years may not be comparable to types of
entries to parole reported by Kansas beginning in 2008. 

Other entries include 1,150 parolees who entered supervision
from absconder status after a warrant was cleared and 189
other parolees (appendix table 13). Absconder includes
parolees who could not be located and had a warrant issued
for their arrest. Other exits include parolees who exited
supervision because a warrant had been issued for other
reasons (appendix table 14). More than one year includes a
relatively small but unknown number of parolees who were
sentenced for a felony, but the incarceration portion of
their sentence was one year or less (appendix table 19).

Kentucky--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 590 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12).

Louisiana--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 783 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12).

Maryland--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 496 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12).

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data are not
comparable to those reported for 2009, as the result of
changes to its database and processing to prepare its parole
data for 2010 are comparable to methods that had been
used prior to 2009 (appendix tables 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, and
20). The total change in Maryland's parole population was
a decrease of 547 parolees on January 1, 2010 (13,195)
compared to the population reported for December 31, 2009
(13,742).

Massachusetts--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 286 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12).

Michigan--number of parolees reported as Hispanic or Latino
is an underestimate because Michigan's information system
does not include a category which directly tracks and
measures parolees who are Hispanic or Latino (appendix table
17).

Mississippi--the 18.6% increase (1,008 parolees) in
Mississippi's parole population during 2010 resulted from
modifications in both parole and house arrest laws and state
statutes that made more offenders eligible for conditional
release. (appendix table 12).

Montana--reporting changes between 2000 and 2009--for changes
in reporting methods that occurred in Montana in 2009, see
Methodology and Probation and Parole in the United States,
2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674.

New Hampshire--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 73 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix
table 12).

New Mexico--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 498 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12).

Reporting changes between 2000 and 2009--for changes in
reporting methods that occurred in New Mexico in 2007,
see Methodology and Probation and Parole in the United
States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674.

New York--other entries include parolees released from prison
at the time of their eligibility without an appearance before
a parole board. New York refers to this type of release as a
presumptive release. Inmates who served sentences for
non-violent offenses and who had no history of violence were
eligible for a presumptive release. New York's presumptive
release law was enacted in 2003, implemented at the end of
2003, and became fully operational during 2004. Other entries
also include parolees who were sentenced directly to parole
supervision with the requirement that they complete a 90-day
drug and alcohol treatment program. New York refers to this
type of entry as judicially sanctioned and it falls under the
Sentencing Reform Act of 1995. Certain drug and property
offenders were eligible for a judicially sanctioned entry
to parole supervision. Other entries also include parolees
released from local jails. In 2006 the New York Division of
Parole resumed the responsibility for supervising selected
inmates released from local jails after serving a sentence
of less than one year. These parolees remain under parole
supervision for one year (appendix table 13).

Returned to incarceration --To receive treatment includes
select parole violators who were sent to a 30-day or 90-day
treatment program in a state correctional facility in lieu of
a revocation and return to prison. Prior to 2009, these data
were reported in Returned to incarceration - Other/unknown
(appendix table 14).Special conditional type of release from
prison includes inmates who were released November 2011 27 to
medical parole because that type of parole permits the
release of certain terminally ill inmates prior to serving
their full sentence. Other type of release from prison
includes the same classifications of parolees who had been
reported in the other entries category (appendix table 21).

North Carolina -total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes offenders under post-release supervision.
Post-release supervision is defined under North Carolina's
Structured Sentencing Act of 1993 as a reintegration program
for serious offenders who served extensive prison terms
(appendix table 12). Weapon offense is the illegal possession
of a weapon, not an offense in which a weapon was used (i.e.,
does not include armed robbery offenses) (appendix table 20).
Post-release offenders were reported in term of supervised
release (appendix table 21).

Ohio--the decrease (down 17.1% or 2,499 parolees) in Ohio's
parole population during 2010 was related to an Ohio Supreme
Court case from October 2009. The result was a mandate
to discharge certain post-prison persons from parole, which
was first implemented in November 2009 and continued through
February 2010. The decrease was also partially the result of
database cleaning that took place during 2010 (appendix table
12).

Oregon--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 456 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12).

Pennsylvania--technically, Pennsylvania has one reporting
agency, which is the state agency. The state agency reports
both state and county parole data. However, these data are
reported separately. The state parole population represented
29% of Pennsylvania's total parole population on December 31,
2010, while the county parole population represented 71%.
Reporting changes between 2000 and 2009 for reporting changes
that occurred in Pennsylvania 2004, see Methodology and
Probation and Parole in the United States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ
231674.

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data reported by
Pennsylvania for 2010 are not comparable to those reported
for 2009. Pennsylvania changed its method of reporting county
parole data starting with the January 1, 2010, population to
include some parolees that had previously been classified and
reported as probationers. The total change in Pennsylvania's
parole population was an increase of 20,902 parolees on
January 1, 2010 (96,014), compared to the population reported
for December 31, 2009 (75,112). This is also the first year
for which data on county parole entries and exits have been
provided (appendix tables 12, 13, and 14).

Rhode Island--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
excludes 42 parolees supervised by another state through an
interstate compact agreement (appendix tables 12, 18). Rhode
Island's information system classifies Hispanic or Latino as
a race rather than an ethnicity; therefore, parolees reported
as Hispanic or Latino may also be of another race. In
addition parolees reported among other racial categories may
also be Hispanic or Latino. Rhode Island's information system
does not include a racial category for Hawaiian/Other Pacific
Islander or two or more races (appendix table 17).

South Carolina--reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data
reported by South Carolina for 2010 are not comparable to
those reported for 2009. South Carolina changed its method of
reporting parole data starting with the January 1, 2010,
population as the result of a change in counting procedures,
the inclusion of persons on Community Supervision (who
simultaneously receive both mandatory and discretionary
releases), and the inclusion of Youthful Offender Act (YOA)
releases (appendix table 12 and 13). Community supervision
releases typically remain on mandatory release longer than on
discretionary release, and have been reported as mandatory
releases. YOA releases are young adults, ages 18 to 24, who
receive an indeterminate sentence of up to 6 years (appendix
table 13). The total change in South Carolina's parole
population was an increase of 4,807 parolees on January 1,
2010 (6,419), compared to the population reported for
December 31, 2009 (1,612).

Tennessee--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional 987 parolees supervised for another
state through an interstate compact agreement (appendix table
12).

Vermont--total parole population on December 31, 2010,
excludes an estimated 11 parolees supervised by another state
through an interstate compact agreement (appendix tables
12 and 18). The total parole population on December 31, 2010,
includes an additional estimated 34 parolees supervised by
another state through an interstate compact agreement
(appendix tables 12). Vermont's information system does not
include a racial category for Hispanic or Latino and does not
collect any ethnicity data; therefore, the number of Hispanic
or Latino parolees could not be reported and whether or not
other racial categories include Hispanic or Latino parolees
could not be determined. Vermont's information system also
does not include a racial category for Native Hawaiian/Other
Pacific Islander or two or more races (appendix table 17).

Virginia--reporting changes between 2000 and 2009--for
reporting changes in Virginia that occurred in 2007 and
2008, see Methodology and Probation and Parole in the United
States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ 231674.

Reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data reported by
Virginia for 2010 are not comparable to those reported for
2009. Virginia changed its method of reporting parole data
starting with the January 1, 2010, population as the result
of the implementation of the Virginia Corrections Information
System (VACORIS) and the rebuilding of the offender
population data used for analysis. The total change in
Virginia's parole population was a decrease of 2,040 parolees
on January 1, 2010 (2,565), compared to the population
reported for December 31, 2009 (4,605) (appendix table 12).

Washington--reporting changes between 2000 and 2009--for
reporting changes that occurred in Washington in 2004, see
Probation and Parole in the United States, 2009, BJS Web, NCJ
231674.

Wisconsin--Asian includes an unspecified number of parolees
who were Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander because
Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander could not be reported
separately (appendix table 17).

Wyoming--reporting changes between 2009 and 2010--data
reported by Wyoming for 2010 are not comparable to those
reported for 2009, as the result of a conversion to a new
data processing system, and data cleaning. The total change
in Wyoming's parole population was an increase of 135
parolees on January 1, 2010 (749), compared to the population
reported for December 31, 2009 (614).
