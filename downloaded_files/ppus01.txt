The total Federal, State, and local adult
correctional population -- incarcerated or in
the community -- grew by 147,700 during
2001 to reach a new high of nearly 6.6 million. 
About 3.1% of the U.S. adult population, or
1 in every 32 adults, were incarcerated or on
probation or parole at yearend 2001.

A total of 3,932,751 adult men and women
were on probation at yearend 2001,
representing a growth of 2.8% during the
year.  The adult parole population grew
1.0%, rising to a total of 731,147 by
December 31, 2001. Since 1995 the parole
population has been the slowest growing
correctional population, up 1.2% per year,
com- pared to jails (up 3.7% annually)
prisons (up 3.6% annually), and probation
(up 3.4% annually).

Over 4.6 million adult men and 
women were on probation or parole

At yearend 2001 the number of adult men
and women in the United States who were
being supervised in the community reached
a record high 4,663,898, up from 3,757,282
on December 31, 1995.  These data were
collected in the 2001 Annual Probation
Survey and the 2001 Annual Parole Survey
conducted by the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS).

In 2001 the number of adults under
supervision in the community increased
2.5%, which was less than the average
annual increase of 3.7% since 1995.  

The total adult correctional population,
including those incarcerated and those
being supervised in the community, reached
a new high of 6,592,800 at the end of 2001. 
At yearend 2001, 3.1%, or about 1 in every
32 adults in the United States, were in 
State or Federal prisons, local jails, or 
under the supervision of probation or 
parole authorities, up from 2.7% in 1995.
  
Texas and California led the Nation 
in number of adults supervised 
in the community

More than 1 million persons being supervised 
in the community in 2001, or about 1 in 5 
probationers and parolees, were in Texas and 
California.  Texas led the Nation with 551,372 
persons on probation or parole, followed by 
California with 468,672.

Washington and Texas led the Nation with
the largest percentage of its adult population
under community supervision (each with
3.6% at yearend 2001), followed by Delaware 
(3.4%).  California's community supervision 
rate of 1.9% was about half that of Texas.

Twelve States reported that fewer than 1%
of their adult populations were on probation
or parole.  New Hampshire had the lowest
rate of supervision in the community (486
offenders per 100,000 adults). 4 States 
reported an increase of 10% or more in their 
probation population 

Maine reported an increase of 15% in the
number of adults on probation during 2001. 
Colorado, Virginia, and Kentucky (each up
12%) also reported an increase of at least
10% in their adult probation populations.

Seventeen States had fewer adults on
probation at the end of 2001 than at the
beginning of the year, led by Nevada, down
14%, the only double-digit decrease during
2001.

106,542 probationers added in 2001

During 2001 the probation population grew
106,500, an increase of 2.8%.  This was
more than double the annual increase
recorded in 2000 (46,287) and slightly 
lower than the average increase since 1995 
(up 113,148 per year).

At yearend 2001 the probation supervision
rate totaled 1,849 probationers per 100,000
adult U.S. residents -- the equivalent of 1 
in every 54 adults.  Idaho with 3,747 
probationers per 100,000 adult State residents 
had the highest rate of probation supervision; 
New Hampshire (with 385 per 100,000) had the 
lowest. 

More than 2.1 million adults entered
probation supervision during 2001, an
increase of over 78,500 probation entries
from 2000.  Since 1995 the annual number
of entries to probation has risen by 34%, 
an increase of more than 532,000.  

------------------------------------------------
At yearend 2001, 1 in 5 probationers were
women; 1 in 3 were black

Nationwide, women represented a slightly larger
percentage of the probation population in 2001
than in 1990.  Women were 22% of adults on
probation in 2001(870,000), up from 18% in
1990.

At yearend 2001 about half of all probationers
were white (2,175,600); a third were black
(1,228,700); and an eighth were of Hispanic
origin (469,800).  Persons of other races
comprised about 2% of probationers (58,600).  

Half of all probationers convicted of a felony;
a quarter convicted of a drug law violation

Probationers are criminal offenders who have
been sentenced to a period of conditional
supervision in the community.  At yearend 2001,
53% had been convicted of a felony offense.

More than half of those on probation (54%) 
had a direct sentence to probation; 25% 
had received a sentence to incarceration 
that had been suspended; and 9% had received 
a split sentence that included incarceration 
followed by probation.  An additional 10% 
had entered probation before completion of 
all court proceedings (including those who 
entered probation before final verdict).

Approximately 3 of every 4 probationers were
under active supervision and were required to
regularly report to a probation authority in
person, by mail, or by telephone.  The percent 
of probationers required to report regularly 
has dropped steadily, from 83% in 1990 to 79% 
in 1995 and to 74% in 2001.

At yearend 2001 at least 1 in 10 probationers 
had absconded -- though still on probation, 
they had failed to report and could not be 
located.  Among all persons on probation, 
absconders have increased from 6% in 1990 
to 10% in 2001.

In 2001, 25% of probationers had a drug law
violation; 18% were sentenced for driving 
while intoxicated or under the influence of 
alcohol; 7% for minor traffic offenses; and 
7% for domestic violence.

More than 3 out of 5 of the nearly 2 million
adults discharged from probation in 2001 had
successfully met the conditions of their
supervision.  Approximately 13% of those
discharged from probation supervision were
incarcerated because of a rule violation or 
new offense.  An additional 3% of those 
discharged had absconded, and 11% had their 
probation sentence revoked without 
incarceration.  
-----------------------------------------------

Parole population up by fewer than 7,500
during 2001

Also serving time in the community at the
end of 2001 were 731,147 adults on parole. 
Parole is a period of conditional supervised
release following a prison term.  Prisoners
may be released to parole either by a parole
board decision or by mandatory conditional
release.

The 1.0% growth in parole during 2001-- a
net increase of 7,249 parolees -- was
slightly smaller than the average annual
increase of 1.2% in parole since 1995. 
Nearly all parolees had been convicted of 
a felony (95%).

11 States had double-digit increases 
in their parole populations; 
2 had similar decreases

For the year ending December 31, 2001, 11
States reported an increase of 10% or more
in their parole population. Oklahoma led
with 87%, followed by two other States with
increases of 19% or higher: Idaho (20%)
and Arkansas (19%).

A total of 17 States reported a decrease in
their adult parole population during 2001. 
Two States reported double-digit decreases,
led by West Virginia (down 16%) and North
Carolina (down 12%). 

Women accounted for more than  
1 of every 8 adults on parole in 2001 

About 1 of every 8 adults on parole in 2001
(90,700) were women.  Women represented
a larger percentage of the parole population
(12%) in 2001 than in 1990 when they were
8%.

More than 2 out of 5 adults on parole on
December 31, 2001, (299,400) were black; 
more than 1 in 3 were white (285,500).  
Nineteen percent of parolees were Hispanic 
(136,500). About 2% were of other races 
(9,800).  

Since 1990 discretionary releases to
parole have dropped, while mandatory
releases have risen
 
Discretionary releases of prisoners to parole
supervision by a parole board have decreased 
from 59% of adults entering parole in 1990 to 
36%, or 161,100, in 2001. Mandatory releases 
to parole supervision increased from 41% in 
1990 to 55% (248,000) in 2001.

At yearend 2001 more than 4 of every 5
parolees were under active supervision and
were required to maintain regular contact
with the paroling agency.  About 7% of
parolees were absconders and could not be 
located.

40% of parolees discharged from 
supervision were incarcerated 

Of the more than 464,500 parolees discharged
from supervision in 2001, 46% had successfully
met the conditions of their supervision, while
40% had been returned to incarceration either
because of a rule violation or new offense.  
An additional 9% had absconded and 2% had 
failed to successfully meet the conditions 
of supervision but were discharged without
incarceration.  

The success rate among those discharged from
parole dropped from 50% in 1990 to 46%;
however, the percent incarcerated also dropped
(from 46% to 40%).  These declines were offset
by increases in absconders (from 1% to 9%).

Correctional supervision rate 
highest in Texas and lowest 
in New Hampshire

Texas led the Nation at yearend 2001 with 
4,818 adults under correctional supervision 
per 100,000 adult State residents, followed 
by Idaho (4,786) and Delaware (4,545).  New 
Hampshire (924 per 100,000), West Virginia 
(940), and North Dakota (1,008) had the fewest 
adults on probation or parole or in prison or 
jail relative to their State populations.

Offenders on probation or parole represented
nearly 71% of all persons under correctional
supervision at yearend. The 10 States with the
highest rates of correctional supervision were
also the 10 States with the highest rates of
probation supervision.  

Except for Texas, with 27% of its correctional
population in prison or jail, States with the
highest correctional supervision rate had an
appreciably lower percentage of their
correctional populations incarcerated.  
Minnesota with the 3,474 persons under 
supervision per 100,000 adult residents had the 
lowest percent incarcerated (8.9% of all persons 
under supervision). 
Other States with a low percentage 
incarcerated included Vermont and Rhode 
Island (with 12%)and Washington State 
(with 15%).  Mississippi with 60% of its 
correctional population incarcerated had 
the highest percentage among States, 
followed by Virginia (55%) and Nevada 
(51%). 

Methodology

The Annual Probation and Parole Surveys
provide a count of the total number of
persons supervised in the community on
January 1 and December 31, 2001, and a
count of the number entering and leaving
supervision during the year. These surveys
cover all 50 States, the District
of Columbia, and the Federal system.

Data for the Federal system are from the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts 
as provided to the BJS Federal Justice
Statistics Program.

Because many States update their population 
counts, the January 1, 2001, numbers may 
differ from those previously published for 
December 31, 2000.

Probation  

The 2001 Annual Probation Survey was sent 
to 477 respondents -- 36 central State
reporters and 441 separate State, county, 
or court agencies.  States with multiple
reporters were Alabama (3), Arizona (2),
Colorado (9), Florida (44), Georgia (5),
Idaho (2), Kentucky (3), Michigan (132),
Missouri (2), New Mexico (2), Ohio (190),
Oklahoma (3), Tennessee (3), Washington
(35), and West Virginia (2).           
              
Since 1997 the survey coverage has been
expanded to include 186 additional
agencies previously excluded from the
survey.  At yearend 2001, 176,005
probationers were under the supervision of
these agencies.  For year-to-year
comparisons, use total counts based on the 
same reporting agencies -- 3,266,837 in
1997 to compare with the final 1996 counts;
3,417,613 in 1998 to compare with final
1997; and 3,773,624 in 1999 to compare
with final 1998.  

Parole  

The 2001 Annual Parole Survey was sent to
54 respondents, including 52 central
reporters, the California Youth Authority,
and 1 municipal agency.  States with
multiple reporters were Alabama (2) and
California (2).

Federal parole as defined here includes
supervised release, parole, military parole,
special parole, and mandatory release.
