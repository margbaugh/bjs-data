Introduction

The 2006 Census of Jail Facilities was the ninth in a series
of complete enumerations since 1970 collected by the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS). Through the census, BJS collects
jurisdiction and facility-level data on jails in the United
States. The data include the number of jurisdictions and
facilities, functions, confined inmates, and inmate-to-staff
ratios. The data also show the number of jurisdictions by
size, incarceration rates, judicial sanctions, jail staff,
and the number operated publicly or under contract to county
or city governments. Findings from the 2006 census are
included in this report together with comparisons from the
1999 Census of Jail Facilities. Additional findings for 1999
are available in Census of Jails, 1999 (BJS Web. 1 Sept.
2001).

HIGHLIGHTS

* A total of 3,283 jail facilities, including jails in the
federal system, were operating in 2006,
down 93 from 3,376 in 1999.

* The number of jail jurisdictions in the U.S. decreased from
3,000 in 1999 to 2,860 in 2006.

* Hospitalization or medical treatment confinement was a
function of 421 local jail facilities.

* Private and public entities under contract to local
governments operated 37 jail facilities in
2006, down from 47 in 1999.

* About 7% of jail jurisdictions were under court order or
consent decree to limit the size of the
inmate population in 2006, down from about 11% in 1999.

* As the number of confined jail inmates increased faster
than the number of jail staff, the
number of confined inmates per employee rose from 2.9 in 1999
to 3.3 in 2006.

Jail Organization

Jails in the United States operate under the authority of
local or federal government. Entities such as cities,
counties, and towns operate jails under local government
authority, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons operates jails
under federal government authority.  

In this report government authorities are collectively
referred to as jail jurisdictions, indicating a legal status
which typically corresponds to, but is not the same as a
geographic/political jurisdiction. 

In recent years authorities governing local 
political/geographic jurisdictions have discovered the
financial benefits and economies of scale associated with
operating regional jails and have consolidated their jail
detention operations with neighboring jail jurisdictions.
Some authorities have continued to use the physical plants of
their former jail jurisdictions for policing and short-term
detention. These functions are out-of-scope for the jail
censuses and are excluded from the counts. 

As the result of consolidations and the development of
regional jails, the nationwide trend has been toward fewer
jail jurisdictions and jail facilities, even as the local
jail population has increased. The number of local
political/geographic jurisdictions has been unaffected by
these changes.

In earlier BJS jail census reports, jail reporting units were
called jail jurisdictions, and jail jurisdictions were not
identified.

Jail facilities are confinement facilities, which are usually
administered by a local law enforcement agency. These
facilities are intended for adults, but sometimes hold
juveniles before or after adjudication. Jail facilities
perform numerous functions, including receiving individuals
pending arraignment and holding individuals who are awaiting
trial, conviction, or sentencing. Some jail facilities
operate community-based programs as alternatives to
incarceration.   

In most localities, a city or county government operates a
single jail facility. In these jurisdictions, the jail
jurisdiction and the jail facility are one in the same. In
some urban areas, however, jail jurisdictions operate two,
three, four, or more jail facilities and designate one or
more jail reporting units to respond to data queries.
Contract facilities, such as private jails, are generally
designated as separate reporting units within a jail
jurisdiction. 

Jail Jurisdictions and Facilities

Decline in the number of jails

The growing use of regional jails and the consolidation of
jail operations in rural areas contributed to the decline in
the number of jails between 1999 and 2006. As towns and
counties pooled their resources to create upgraded regional
facilities, the number of regional jails increased from 42 in
14 states at the time of the 1999 Jail Census to at least 63
in 17 states in 2006. (See Methodology.) 

The number of jail jurisdictions and the number of jail
facilities decreased, while the confined jail population
increased between 1999 and 2006.

The number of jail jurisdictions in the United States
declined by 140, from 3,000 to 2,860 between 1999 and 2006
(table 1). A total of 3,283 jail facilities, including those
in the federal system, were operating in 2006, down 3% from
1999.

The number of confined jail inmates rose by 23% between 1999
and 2006 to reach 762,003 inmates. Local jails held about 98%
of all confined jail inmates in 1999 and 2006, while the
federal jurisdiction held less than 2% in both years. In
2006, 261 jail inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents were
confined in the nation's jails, an increase of 29 jail
inmates per 100,000 residents since 1999. The inmate-to-staff
ratio also increased from 2.9 to 3.3 inmates per employee
during this period.

The number of jail jurisdictions declined by 5%, and the
number of jail facilities decreased by
3% between 1999 and 2006.

* Thirty-one states had decreases in the number of jail
jurisdictions between 1999 and 2006 (table 2).

* West Virginia (down 17), Georgia (down 13), Alabama (down
14), and Texas (down 11) accounted for more than a third
(39%) of the decline in the number of jail jurisdictions
between 1999 and 2006.

* The number of jail jurisdictions in each state either
declined or remained the same between 1999 and 2006. No state
had an increase in the number of jail jurisdictions during
this period. Jurisdictions in 21 states operated 93 fewer
jails in 2006 than in 1999, accounting for the entire
decline in the number of jail facilities during this period.

* Decreases in the number of jails in West Virginia (down
16), California (down 15), and Alabama (down 14) made up
nearly half (48%) of the decline in the number of facilities
between 1999 and 2006.

* Fifteen states and the District of Columbia had increases
in the number of jail facilities between 1999 and 2006.
Facilities in Louisiana (up 8), the District of Columbia (up
5), and Wisconsin (up 4) accounted for nearly half of the 35
additional facilities reported in the 2006 census.

* Jails in the federal jurisdiction increased from 11 to 12
between 1999 and 2006.

Jail Functions

General population confinement and return to custody
confinement were the most common jail functions.

General population confinement was the predominant jail
function provided by 97% of local jail facilities in 2006,
followed by returned to custody (table 3). Nearly two-thirds
(65%) of all reporting jurisdictions in 2006 provided the
return to custody function, which involves holding
probationers and parolees who have been returned to jail for
technical violations or new charges.
 
Nearly half (46%) of all jails provided work release or
prerelease programs, and about a quarter performed reception,
diagnosis, or classification functions. Approximately 12% had
a youthful offender confinement function, 10% had a drug or
alcohol treatment, and about 1% had a boot camp function.

The proportion of jails offering work release or prerelease,
hospitalization or medical treatment, and alcohol or drug
treatment functions varied by state.

* North Dakota (91%), Minnesota (85%), and Pennsylvania (83%)
had the largest percentages of jails with work release or
prerelease functions (table 4). Montana (15%), New York
(11%), and Alaska (0%) had the smallest percentages of jails
that provided this function. 

* Jails in Mississippi (44%), New Jersey (36%), and
Massachusetts (32%) reported the highest percentages with
hospitalization or medical treatment functions; Alaska, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and West Virginia reported none. 

* Massachusetts (45%), Kentucky (37%), and New Jersey (36%)
had the largest percentages of jails that offered alcohol or
drug treatment functions; Alaska, West Virginia, and
Wisconsin reported none.

Sex of inmate authorized to house

More than 4 in 5 jails were authorized to house both male and
female inmates.

Approximately 86% of the nation's jails were authorized to
house both male and female inmates in 2006 (table 5). About
13% (425) of all jails housed men only and about 1% (32) of
the nation's jails housed women only.

* All local jails in Nevada, West Virginia, and Wyoming and
the 15 locally operated facilities in Alaska were authorized
to house both sexes. 

* Louisiana (43%) and Massachusetts (41%) had the largest
proportions of jails that housed men only.

* The 32 jails for women only were located in 16 states and
the District of Columbia. Jurisdictions with the largest
proportions of jails for women only were the District of
Columbia (17%), California (6%), and Massachusetts and
Louisiana (5% each). 

Contract or Publicly Operated Jail Jurisdictions

Public authorities operated nearly all jail facilities in
2006. 

City, county, and federal correctional authorities operated
approximately 99% of all jail facilities in 2006. The
remaining 1% was operated under contract by private or public
entities authorized by city or county governments (table 6).
The number of contract-operated jail facilities declined
from 47 in 1999 to 37 in 2006. 

Texas had the largest number of contract-operated jails in
2006.

* Seven states accounted for most of the contract jail
operations in 2006: Texas (8), California (5), Pennsylvania
(4), and Florida, Missouri, New Mexico, and Tennessee (3
each). 

* Between 1999 and 2006, the number of contract jail
facilities increased in Alabama and Missouri; decreased in
California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and Washington; and was unchanged
in the remaining states.

Judicial Sanctions

About 9% of all local jail jurisdictions had one or more jail
facilities under court order or consent decree in 2006.

On March 31, 2006, a total of 254 jail jurisdictions were
under one or more court orders or consent decrees either to
limit population or for specific conditions of confinement
(table 7). About 7% (204) of all jurisdictions were under
judicial sanction to limit population, and about 6% (165)
were under court order for specific conditions. Specific
conditions included crowding, medical facilities, procedures
and policies, programming, inmate classification, exercise,
staffing, food service, religious practices, and other
issues. 

About 1 in 17 (6%) of jail jurisdictions reported one or more
facilities under judicial sanction for specific conditions of
confinement in 2006.

* California had the largest percentage of jail jurisdictions
ordered to limit population (28%), followed by Massachusetts
(23%), Louisiana (22%), and Mississippi and Oregon (19%
each).

* California (34%) and Massachusetts (23%) also reported the
highest percentages of jurisdictions under court order for
special conditions, followed by Oregon (16%), and Kentucky
and Mississippi (12% each). 

* No jail jurisdictions in Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska,
Nevada, New Hampshire, the District of Columbia, and the
federal jurisdiction reported that any of their jails were
under judicial sanctions at the time of the census.

Size of Jurisdiction

Nearly 40% of all jail jurisdictions held fewer than 50
inmates.

Most jail jurisdictions were small with nearly 40% holding
fewer than 50 inmates in 2006 (table 8). On the date of the
census, nearly three-fifths (59%) of all jail jurisdictions
held 99 or fewer inmates, about 20% held 100 to 249 inmates,
and 10% held 250 to 499 jail inmates. Jurisdictions holding
500 to 999 inmates accounted for about 6% of all
jurisdictions, and those housing 1,000 or more confined
inmates accounted for 5%.

* Two-thirds or more of all jail jurisdictions had fewer than
50 inmates in Iowa (82%), Nebraska (81%), Montana (80%),
South Dakota (79%), North Dakota (68%), Idaho (66%), and
Kansas (67%). All 15 independently operated local jail
jurisdictions in Alaska also held fewer than 50
inmates.

* While 43 states had jail jurisdictions that held fewer than
50 inmates, 5 states accounted for 35% of all jurisdictions
in this size category: Texas (112), Iowa (76), Alabama (74),
Missouri (72), and Kansas (63).

* Maryland and New Jersey had no jail jurisdictions holding
fewer than 50 inmates in 2006.

* Each of the 15 locally operated jails in Alaska held fewer
than 50 inmates. Alaska housed most jail detainees in a
combined jail-prison system. (See Methodology for discussion
of incarcerated populations in combined jail/prison states.)

* Jurisdictions in Florida and California (20 each) accounted
for about a quarter (27%) of all jurisdictions housing 1,000
or more inmates.

* New York and California each had one jail jurisdiction that
held 10,000 inmates or more at the time of the census (not
shown in table).

Jail Population

The number of confined jail inmates rose 23% between 1999 and
2006.

The nation's local and federal jails held a total of 762,003
confined inmates on March 31, 2006, up 23% from 617,152 on
June 30, 1999 (table 9). Nearly all states and the federal
jurisdiction had increases in the number of confined jail
inmates during this period. 

Jail inmates confined in California, Texas, Florida, Georgia,
and New York accounted for 41% of all inmates held in local
jurisdictions in 1999. California, Texas, Florida, Georgia,
and New York held 37% of all inmates confined in local jail
jurisdictions in 2006. Pennsylvania had a larger combined
jail population (35,948) than New York (32,324) in 2006.

The size of the jail population declined in two states
between 1999 and 2006.

* Two states had declines in local jail populations between
1999 and 2006: Alaska (down 12%) and New York (down 3%).

* Between 1999 and 2006, the largest relative growth of the
jail inmate population occurred in the District of Columbia
(128%), followed by West Virginia (75%) and New Mexico (70%).

* New Jersey (9%), Oregon (7%), and California (3%) had the
smallest relative growth of jail inmate populations between
1999 and 2006.

The proportions of jail inmates confined in facilities
operated directly by jail jurisdictions and confined in
facilities operated under contract to jail jurisdictions were
the same in 1999 and 2006.

* In both 1999 and 2006, 98% of all jail inmates were
confined in jail facilities operated directly by jail
jurisdictions, and 2% were confined in facilities operated
either by private entities or by other local or state
authorities under contract to jail jurisdictions.

* The number of jail inmates confined in contract facilities
rose 11% from 13,814 in 1999 to 15,384 in 2006.

* Jail inmates in 15 states were confined in facilities
operated under contract in 2009. 

* More than two-thirds of inmates in contract facilities in
2006 were located in four states: Texas (3,698), Tennessee
(2,475), Pennsylvania (2,339), and Florida (2,157). 

Jail Population by size of jurisdiction

Nearly half of all local jail inmates were confined in
jurisdictions holding 1,000 or more inmates in 2006.

Local jail jurisdictions confined 748,197 nonfederal jail
inmates in 2006 (table 10). Jurisdictions in the smallest
size categories accounted for the largest share of
jurisdictions, but they held the smallest share of the
confined jail population. Jail jurisdictions holding fewer
than 100 inmates accounted for 59% of all jail jurisdictions
and held 8% of the jail population. In contrast,
jurisdictions in the largest size category (1,000 or more
inmates) accounted for 5% of local jail jurisdictions and
held half the nation's jail population.

The proportion of inmates held in different size
jurisdictions varied by region and state.

* Nationwide, about 3% of confined jail inmates were housed
in the smallest jail jurisdictions, or those holding less
than 50 inmates. The proportion of jail inmates housed in
jurisdictions that held fewer than 50 inmates was highest in
Iowa and South Dakota, where 25% of confined inmates were
held, followed by Nebraska (20%). By contrast, Maryland and
New Jersey had no inmates in jail jurisdictions holding fewer
than 50 inmates. 

* The concentration of confined jail inmates in the largest
size jurisdictions (1,000 inmates or more) was highest in
California (88%), Massachusetts (79%), Florida (77%), and
Arizona (74%). By contrast, 14 states reported no jail
jurisdictions housing 1,000 inmates or more: Maine, New
Hampshire, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South
Dakota, Arkansas, Mississippi, West Virginia, Alaska, Idaho,
Montana, and Wyoming.

Rate of Confinement

Jail confinement rates increased in most states between 1999
and 2006.

* The confinement rate of inmates in local jail jurisdictions
increased from 228 to 256 per 100,000 U.S. residents between
1999 and 2006 (table 11).

* Louisiana (660), Georgia (462), and New Mexico (454)
reported the highest confinement rates of jail inmates among
the states. The District of Columbia (649), a wholly urban
jurisdiction, also had one of the highest confinement rates
of jail inmates in 2006.

* Louisiana's resident population declined from 4,372,035 in
1999 to 4,287,768 in 2006, partly due to the effects of
Hurricane Katrina. If the number of residents had stayed the
same in both years, Louisiana's jail incarceration rate would
have been 648 inmates per 100,000 persons, still
the highest of any state by a significant margin.

* Maine (124) and Iowa (127) had the lowest rates of
confinement of jail inmates among local jail jurisdictions. 

* The lowest rate of confined jail inmates was in the federal
jurisdiction with 5 per 100,000 U.S. residents.

* The confinement rate of jail inmates decreased in six
states between 1999 and 2006: Nevada and New York (down 17
inmates each), California (down 16), Oregon (down 8), and
Texas (down 6).

Jail Staff

Approximately 234,000 employees worked in the nation's jails. 

An estimated 234,000 employees worked in the nation's jails
in 2006 (table 12). (See Methodology for estimation
discussion.) Employees included full-time and part-time
payroll and non-payroll staff working in occupations as
correctional officers and administrators, and in clerical,
maintenance, education, and professional staff positions.
Local jail jurisdictions in the South employed the largest
percentage (44%) of staff. Workers in the Northeast (19%),
West (18%), and Midwest (17%) together accounted for slightly
more than half of all jail employees.

The number of employees increased in local jail jurisdictions
and declined in the federal jurisdiction between 1999 and
2006.

* Jail jurisdictions reported a total of 231,515 full-time
and part-time payroll and non-payroll staff in the nation's
local and federal jails in 2006.

* An estimated 231,000 employees worked in local jail
jurisdictions in 2006, up 11% from 207,600 employees in 1999
(not shown in table).

* The number of jail staff in the federal jurisdiction
declined 3%, from 3,110 employees in 1999 to 3,031 employees
in 2006 (not show in table). 

Inmate-to-Staff Ratio

The number of inmates per jail employee rose between 1999 and
2006. 

* The jail inmate-to-staff ratio in the U.S. increased from
2.9 to 1 in 1999 to 3.3 to 1 in 2006 (table 13).

* The largest increases in the number of confined jail
inmates per employee occurred in the District of Columbia (up
2.0 inmates per employee), Indiana (up 1.4), and Colorado,
West Virginia, and the federal jurisdiction (up 1.0 each).

* Massachusetts and Utah (down 0.4 each) and Washington (down
0.3) had the largest declines in inmate-to-staff ratios
between 1999 and 2006.

* Louisiana had the highest inmate-to-staff ratio in 2006
(4.7 inmates per employee), followed by California (4.6) and
the federal jurisdiction (4.6).

* Alaska (0.5), Maine (1.4), New York (1.5), and
Massachusetts and Nebraska (1.9 each) had the lowest
inmate-to-staff ratios in 2006. 

Methodology

The 2006 Census of Jail Facilities was the ninth in a series
of complete enumerations of jail facilities since 1970
collected by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). BJS
split the jail census into two parts. The Census of Jail
Inmates was conducted with a reference date of June 30, 2005.
The following spring it was followed by the Census of Jail
Facilities, which collected data as of March 31, 2006. The
U.S. Census Bureau collected the data for BJS.

The census requested jurisdictional-level information on the
number of confined inmates, separate jail facilities, average
daily population, renovation and building plans, court orders
and consent decrees, staff by occupational category and
race/ethnicity, jail programs, and costs of operation. The
census also requested facility-level data on rated capacity,
number of confined inmates by gender and adult or juvenile
status, and jail functions, such as general adult
population confinement, work release, and medical treatment. 

Because the census was a complete enumeration, the results
were not subject to sampling error. The results were
affected, however, by significant item nonresponse. Missing
data ranged from 20% to 44% for average daily population,
employees by full-time and part-time status, gender,
race/ethnicity, occupational category, jail programs, costs
of incarceration, and individual jail rated capacity.
Complete or nearly complete reporting was recorded on the
number of jail jurisdictions, number of jail facilities, type
of facility operator (public authority or under contract),
size of jail jurisdiction, and number of jail staff. 

Included in the census

The 2006 Census of Jail Facilities gathered data from all
jail detention facilities holding inmates beyond arraignment,
a period normally exceeding 72 hours. Included in the census
were 2,859 local jail jurisdictions made up of 3,271 city,
county, or privately operated jail facilities intended
for adults, but sometimes holding juveniles (defined as
persons under age 18), and 12 Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP)
facilities that functioned as jails.

In 1999 the BOP reported its 11 detention facilities together
as a single jurisdiction. In 2006 each of its 12 detention
facilities was classified as a separate jurisdiction. To
maintain comparability between the two censuses, BJS counted
the 12 BOP detention facilities in 2006 as a single
jurisdiction. 

Tables in this report show a nationwide total number of jail
jurisdictions of 2,860, 89 fewer than the 2,949 jurisdiction
records produced by the public use data set. This difference
results from the reclassification of some jail reporting
units to reflect a more accurate count of jail jurisdictions,
and corresponds to jail jurisdiction classification
procedures followed in the BJS Annual Survey of Jails series. 

Excluded from the census

Excluded from the census were physically separate temporary
holding facilities, such as drunk tanks and police lockups
that do not hold persons after being formally charged in
court. Also excluded were state-operated facilities in
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, and
Alaska, which have combined jail-prison systems. Fifteen
independently operated jails in Alaska, however, were
included in the census.

Unit non-response

The number of jail jurisdictions and jail facilities in 2006
are for entities that reported data. Comparisons with the
number of jail jurisdictions identified in the 2005 Census of
Jail Inmates and the 2000, 2006, and 2007 Deaths In Custody
(DCRP) data collections indicated that nearly all queried
jail jurisdictions in the 2006 Census of Jail Facilities
either responded and were included or were excluded according
to the scope of the census.

Regional jails

In addition to the 44 regional jails counted in the 2006
Census of Jail Facilities, two other BJS data sources, Prison
and Jail Inmates at Midyear 2006 (NCJ 217675) and Deaths in
Custody Reporting Program (DCRP) unpublished data, identified
19 jails that also met the regional definition (a facility in
which two or more jail jurisdictions had a formal agreement
to operate), bringing the nationwide total to 63. A study
conducted by Luminosity, Inc. in December 2008 reported a
total of 80 regional jails operating in 22 states.
***[Footnote *Regional Jail Feasibility Study. Community
Resource Services, Inc., in association with Luminosity,
Inc., Gettysburg, PA. December, 2008.***

Combined jail/prison states

In the 6 states with combined jail/prison systems,
unsentenced prisoners and prioners with sentences of 1 year
or less accounted for between 26% (Vermont) and 46% (Rhode
Island) of all inmates in 2006.

Estimation procedures

1. In the 14 states where the number of staff was
incompletely reported, an estimate was calculated as follows:
the total number of inmates was divided by the number of
inmates in facilities reporting staff. The result was
multiplied by the reported number of staff and rounded to
the nearest 100. Complete and estimated state totals were
then summed to regional totals; regional totals were rounded
to the nearest 100 and summed to the total for all states and
the U.S. total.  Employees included full and part-time
payroll and non-payroll staff and excluded community
volunteers.

2. Rates, ratios, and percentage distributions were based on
reported data.
