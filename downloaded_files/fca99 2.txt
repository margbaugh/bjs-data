Highlights

*  Between 1985 and 1993 the number of
Federal criminal appeals filed increased
from 4,989 to 11,862. After 1993 the
number filed decreased to 10,251 during
1999.

*  The criminal appeal rate peaked during
1993 at 23 appeals filed for every 100
convictions.  After 1993 the appeal rate
decreased to 16 per 100 convictions in
1999.  

*  95% of appeals were filed by the
defendant; 5% by the government.

*  Defendants convicted of violent and
weapons offenses filed appeals at the
highest rates: 24 per 100 convictions for
violent offenders and 29 per 100 for
weapons offenders.

*  67% of appeals were filed by offenders
who pleaded guilty to at least one of the
offenses charged. 

*  66% of appeals were filed by offenders
represented by publicly provided counsel;
33%, privately retained counsel; and 1%,
pro se.

*  44% of offenders who filed an appeal
were subject to a mandatory prison
sentence; 11% were sentenced below the
applicable sentencing range for
substantial assistance.

*  Of the criminal appeals concluded
during 1999, 77% were terminated on the
merits.  District court decisions were at
least partially affirmed in 85% of these
cases.

*  For 769 prison inmates, a successful
appeal resulted in an average  sentence
reduction of 51 months.  For 86 inmates a
successful appeal by the government
resulted in a sentence increase of 25
months.
----------------------------------------------------------

Between 1985 and 1993 the number of
Federal criminal appeals filed in U.S.
courts of appeal increased from 4,989 to
11,862.  After peaking during 1993, the
number of appeals filed decreased to
10,251 during 1999.

Prior to implementation of the Sentencing
Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), Federal
criminal appeals were limited to appeals
of procedural, or interlocutory, decisions
and challenges by the defendant of the
final judgment.  The SRA opened the
sentencing process to appellate review. 
Pursuant to the SRA both parties may
appeal the sentence imposed.

Imposed sentences may be appealed by
the defendant or the government if (1) the
sentence was imposed in violation of
existing law, (2) the sentencing guidelines
were incorrectly applied, (3) the court
departed from the sentencing guidelines,
or (4) the sentence was plainly
unreasonable for offenses not addressed
by the guidelines.

During the 5 years following imple-
mentation of the Federal sentencing
guidelines, the rate at which criminal
appeals were filed increased an average
of 10% annually -- from 13 per 100
convictions during 1985 to 23 per 100
convictions during 1993.  After 1993 the
appeal rate decreased to 16 per 100
convictions, in 1999. 

Criminal appeals filed in U.S. courts 
of appeal

During 1999, 10,251 criminal appeals
were filed with the U.S. courts of appeal. 
Of these, 95% were filed by the defendant
and 5% by the government.  Almost half
of the appeals filed challenged both the
sentence imposed and the underlying
conviction; 23% only the sentence, 13%
only the conviction, and 16% other issues. 
During 1999, 19% of interlocutory appeals
were filed by the government compared to
6% or less of appeals challenging the
sentence.

Filing rate across Federal judicial
districts

The rate at which criminal cases were
appealed varied substantially across
Federal judicial districts.  During 
1999, the filing rate in 11 (Arizona, 
Southern California, Middle Georgia, 
Hawaii, New Mexico, Northern New York, 
North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands,
Oregon, Western Texas, and Virgin
Islands) of the 94 Federal judicial 
districts was less than 10 appeals 
per 100 criminal convictions.  By 
contrast, in another 9 districts 
(Southern Alabama, Central California, 
Connecticut, Northern Florida, Maine, 
Rhode Island, Western Tennessee, and 
Eastern and Western Wisconsin), the 
filing rate was 30 or more per 100 
criminal convictions -- ranging from 
30 to 38 appeals per 100 convictions.  
In about half of the districts (46), 
the filing rate ranged from 10 to 19
appeals per 100 convictions.

Characteristics of criminal cases 
appealed

Offense of conviction.  Defendants
convicted of violent, drug, and 
weapons offenses filed a 
disproportionate larger number of 
criminal appeals than defendants 
convicted of other offenses such 
as property, immigration, and
misdemeanor offenses.  Defendants
convicted of drug offenses filed 
almost half (44%) of all criminal 
appeals; defendants convicted of 
weapons offenses filed 10%; violent 
offenders, 7% (not shown in a table).  

Defendants convicted of weapons
offenses were among those most likely 
to file an appeal: during 1999, weapons
offenders filed 29 appeals for every 
100 convictions.  Defendants 
convicted of violent and drug offenses 
were also more likely to file an appeal: 
violent offenders filed 24 appeals for 
every 100 convictions; drug offenders, 
18.  Defendants convicted of property, 
immigration, and misdemeanor offenses 
were among the least likely to file an 
appeal: property offenders filed 14 
appeals for every 100 convictions; 
immigration offenders, 10; and those 
convicted of misdemeanors, 5.

Type of counsel.  Two-thirds of criminal
appeals were filed by defendants
represented by publicly provided counsel:
41% by appointed counsel, and 25% by
Federal defenders.  A third of appeals 
were filed by defendants represented by 
privately retained counsel.  Less than 
1% were filed by offenders who represented
themselves.

-----------------------------
Criminal appeals filed in U.S. 
courts of appeal, 1985-99 

The number of Federal criminal appeals
filed increased from 4,989 during 1985 
to 11,862 during 1993.  After 1993 the
number of criminal appeals filed
decreased to 10,251 filed during 1999.  

The increase in appeals was primarily 
the result of changes in legislation 
that permitted Federal sentences to be
appealed.  Prior to the Sentencing 
Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), Federal 
criminal appeals were limited to 
appeals of procedural, or interlocutory, 
decisions by the district court and 
challenges by the defendant of the 
final judgment.  

The SRA opened the sentencing process
to appellate review.  The SRA permits
both the defendant and government to
appeal a sentence if (1) the sentence 
was imposed in violation of law, (2) 
the sentencing guidelines were 
incorrectly applied, (3) the court 
departed from the sentencing guidelines, 
or (4) the sentence was plainly 
unreasonable for offenses not addressed 
by the guidelines.  (See 18 U.S.C. 
sec. 3742.)
                   
While both the number of defendants
prosecuted in U.S. district courts 
and the number of appeals filed 
increased between 1985 and 1999, the 
number of appeals increased at more 
than twice the rate of criminal con-
victions.  The number of appeals filed 
increased an average of 5.3% annually; 
the number of criminal convictions rose 
an average of 2.4% annually.

During the initial years following
implementation of the Federal sentencing
guidelines, the rate at which convicted
defendants filed an appeal increased from
12 per 100 convictions during 1987 to 23
per 100 during 1993.  After 1993,
however, the appeal rate decreased 30%
to 16 per 100 convictions, in 1999.  

The decline in the appeal rate occurred in
72 of the 94 Federal judicial districts. 
However, in 10 districts (Western
Alabama, Connecticut, Southern Georgia,
New Jersey, Western New York, Eastern
Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, South
Carolina, Western Virginia, and Western
Washington) the appeal rate increased
more than 20% between 1993 and 1999.
---------------------------------

Available data suggest that defendants
represented by publicly provided 
counsel at the time they were ad-
judicated of the criminal offense 
were no less likely to file a 
criminal appeal than defendants
represented by privately retained 
counsel. Approximately two-thirds 
of defendants convicted of an offense 
in U.S. district courts were repre-
sented by publicly provided counsel.  
(See Defense Counsel in Criminal Cases, 
BJS Special Report, November 2000, 
NCJ 179023.)  The rest were repre-
sented by privately retained counsel.

The type of appeal filed did not vary
substantially by type of counsel
representing the defendant:  74% of
appeals filed by defendants represented
by publicly provided counsel challenged
the sentence compared to 71% by those
represented by privately retained counsel.

Mode of conviction.  Two-thirds of 
criminal appeals were filed by defen-
dants who pleaded guilty to at least 
one of the offenses charged.  Three-
quarters of defendants who pleaded 
guilty challenged the sentence imposed, 
32% the sentence only, and 43% the 
sentence and conviction (not shown in 
a table).  By contrast, 81% of defen-
dants who were convicted at trial 
filed an appeal challenging the 
conviction, 16% the conviction only, 
and 65% the conviction and sentence.
    
Sentence imposed.  Almost all (97%)
criminal appeals were filed by defendants
sentenced to a term of imprisonment. 
Defendants who filed a criminal appeal
during 1999 received prison sentences
that, on average, were more than twice as
long as the average prison term received
by all defendants sentenced during 1999: 
126 months for those appealing compared
to 59 months for all defendants. 
Defendants convicted of drug and weapon
offenses received the longest prison
terms on average (161 months).

In addition, 319 appeals were filed by
defendants who received sentences of life
imprisonment and 4 by defendants who
were sentenced to death.

The rate at which defendants filed 
criminal appeals increased as the 
length of their prison terms increased.  
Less than 9% of defendants with a prison 
sentence of less than 5 years filed a 
criminal appeal.  By contrast, about a 
quarter of those with a sentence of 5-10 
years, almost half of those with a 
sentence of 10-20 years, two-thirds of 
those with a sentence of 20-30 years, 
and almost all of those with a sentence 
of more than 30 years filed a criminal 
appeal.

Mandatory minimum sentences. 
Forty-four percent of criminal appeals
were filed by defendants subject to a
minimum prison sentence prescribed 
by statute: 25% to a term of 120 to 239
months, 15% to a term of 60 to 119
months, and 4% to a term of at least 
240 months or life imprisonment.
Almost three-quarters of defendants 
who filed an appeal and were subject 
to a mandatory prison sentence had 
been convicted of a drug offense (not 
shown in a table).  Additionally, 11% 
had been convicted of a weapons offense 
and 17% of other offenses.

Departures from the Federal sentencing
guidelines.  About three-quarters of
defendants filing a criminal appeal were
sentenced within the applicable guideline
sentencing range; 21% below the
guideline sentencing range; and 2%
above the guideline range.  Of those
defendants who were originally sentenced
below the guideline range, 53% received
a downward departure from the guidelines
for substantial assistance, and 47%
received a downward departure for other
reasons.

Half of defendants who filed an appeal
and received a downward departure for
substantial assistance had been convicted
of a drug offense (not shown in a table). 
Additionally, 11% had been convicted of
fraud offenses, 9%, weapons offenses,
7%, immigration offenses, 4%,
racketeering, and 15%, other 
offenses.

Outcome of criminal appeals 
terminated in U.S. courts of 
appeal

During 1999 U.S. courts of appeal
disposed of 10,593 criminal appeals.  
Of these, 23% were terminated for
procedural reasons.  Of appeals
terminated on the merits of the case,
district court decisions were affirmed, 
at least in part, in 85% of the cases.

Appeals filed by the defendant were
generally less successful than appeals
filed by the government.  Of those 
filed by the defendant, 22% were termi-
nated procedurally before oral arguments 
had occurred.  Of those appeals termi-
nated on the merits, the defendant 
succeeded in having the district court 
decision reversed, at least in part, 
or remanded for further consideration 
in 12% of the cases.  By contrast, 
the government succeeded in obtaining 
a reversal or remand in 60% of the 
cases terminated on the merits.

Nearly 40% of interlocutory appeals 
were terminated procedurally during 
1999. Appeals challenging the conviction, 
at least in part, were the least likely 
-- less than 20% -- to result in a 
procedural termination.  

Of those cases terminated on the merits,
appellants were most successful in having
procedural decisions by the district court
reversed or remanded for further
consideration.  During 1999, 33% of
interlocutory appeals terminated on the
merits of the case were reversed or
remanded.  Appeals challenging only the
conviction were the least successful; 
only 10% resulted in a reversal or remand.

------------------------------------
Habeas corpus and 28 USC sec. 2255
motions to vacate a sentence

After all direct appeals have been
disposed of, a Federal offender may 
file a civil motion challenging the 
legality of the incarceration.  The 
writ of habeas corpus allows inmates 
to file petitions challenging the 
constitutionality of the imprisonment. 
The Supreme Court has generally held
that an inmate can raise most
constitutional or jurisdictional claims, 
not raised on direct appeal, in a habeas
corpus petition.*See Brown V. Allen,
344 U.S. 443 (1953) and Stone V.Powell,
428 U.S. 465 (1976).* 

Additionally, Federal inmates may file
petitions to have a sentence vacated, 
set aside, or otherwise corrected on the
grounds that the sentence was imposed in
violation of law, the court was without
jurisdiction to impose the sentence, or 
the sentence was greater than the 
statutory maximum. (See 28 U.S.C. sec. 
2255.)

Between 1985 and 1999, the number of
habeas corpus and sec. 2255 motions to
vacate a sentence increased from 4,932
to 9,342.  With certain exceptions, the 
rate at which inmates filed these motions 
was relatively unchanged between 1985 and
1999.  Substantial short-term increases in
the filing rate occurred during 1985 and
1996-97.

While these petitions represent the
offender's last chance to challenge the
conviction or sentence, most were
dismissed by the district courts.  For
instance, during 1995, 65% of habeas and
sec. 2255 motions were dismissed (see
Prisoner Petitions in the Federal Courts,
1980-96, October 1997, NCJ 164615).  Of
those disposed of following judgments by
the district courts, similar to the 
outcome of direct criminal appeals, 13% 
were decided in favor of the inmate.
---------------------------------

Characteristics of criminal appeals
terminated
         
Offense of conviction.  Appeals filed by
defendants convicted of property offenses
-- specifically fraud -- and immigration
offenses were among the most likely to be
terminated procedurally.  About a quarter
of appeals by these offenders were
procedurally terminated.

Of those appeals terminated on the merits
of the case, appeals filed by defendants
convicted of property and regulatory
offenses more often resulted in a reversal
or remand than appeals by defendants
convicted of other offenses.  Nineteen
percent of appeals filed by defendants
convicted of property offenses -- 
including fraud -- and 17% of appeals 
by defendants convicted of regulatory
offenses were reversed or remanded, at
least in part.  By contrast, appeals 
filed by defendants convicted of 
immigration, drug, and violent offenses 
were among the least successful appeals.  
During 1999, 12% of appeals by immigration
offenders, 12% by drug offenders, and
13% by violent offenders resulted in a
reversal or remand, at least in part.

Type of counsel.  Appeals filed by
defendants represented by privately
retained counsel were more likely 
to be terminated procedurally than 
those by publicly provided counsel.
A quarter of appeals involving privately
retained counsel were procedurally
terminated compared to 20% of those
involving publicly provided counsel.

Of those appeals terminated on the 
merits of the case, appeals by defen-
dants represented by privately retained 
counsel were slightly more successful 
than appeals by defendants represented 
by publicly provided counsel.  During 
1999, 16% of appeals filed by defendants
represented by privately retained counsel
and terminated on the merits of the case
resulted in a reversal or remand compared 
to 12% of appeals filed by defendants 
represented by publicly provided counsel.

Mode of conviction.  Appeals by
defendants who pleaded guilty were more
likely to be terminated procedurally than
appeals by defendants convicted at trial. 
During 1999, 27% of appeals by defendants 
who pleaded guilty were terminated 
procedurally compared to 13% of those by 
defendants convicted at trial.

Of those appeals terminated on the merits
of the case, defendants who were convicted 
following a trial succeeded in obtaining 
a reversal or remand more often than those 
who pleaded guilty.  Fourteen percent of 
appeals by defendants convicted following 
a trial resulted in a reversal or remand.

Impact of reversals and remands on
sentences imposed

While few criminal appeals resulted 
in a reversal or remand, in those cases
remanded for re-sentencing, the impact 
of the appeal on the sentence was
substantial.  During 1999 sentences 
were changed for 855 Federal prison 
inmates as the result of appellate 
action. For the 86 inmates against 
whom the government prevailed in a 
sentence challenge, the imposed prison 
term increased an average of 25 months 
-- from 93 to 118 months.  By contrast, 
for the 769 inmates who prevailed in a 
sentence challenge, the prison term 
was reduced an average of 51 months -- 
from 139 to 88 months.

For some inmates imposed sentences
were increased to or reduced from 
life imprisonment.  The sentence 
for one inmate was increased from 
170 months to life imprisonment, 
and the sentences for 13 inmates 
were reduced from life imprisonment 
to an average of 318 months (not 
shown in a table).  

Drug and weapons offenders were among
those who received both the greatest
reductions and increases in sentences. 
For the 527 drug offenders whose
sentences were reduced, the decrease
was an average of 55 months from 153 
to 98 months.  For the 44 drug offenders
whose sentences were increased, the
increase was an average of 31 months
from 124 to 155 months.  For the 
38 weapons offenders whose sentences
were reduced, sentences imposed
decreased an average of 46 months 
from 130 months to 84 months.

Methodology

Data sources

The primary source of the data for 
tables in this report is the BJS 
Federal Justice Statistics Program 
(FJSP) database.  The FJSP is 
presently constructed from source 
files provided by the U.S. Marshals
Service (USMS), the Executive Office 
for United States Attorneys (EOUSA), 
the Administrative Office of the 
U.S. Courts (AOUSC), the U.S. 
Sentencing Commission (USSC), and 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  

The USMS provides data on offenders
arrested on Federal charges; the 
EOUSA provides data on suspects 
investigated by U.S. attorneys for 
violations of Federal law and the 
U.S. attorney's decision to prosecute; 
the AOUSC provides data on defendants 
charged with Federal offenses in U.S. 
district courts and appeals filed of
U.S. district court decision; the USSC
provides detailed data describing
defendants convicted and the sentence
imposed; and the BOP provides data on
defendants incarcerated in Federal
prisons.  Data are reported for the 
Federal fiscal years beginning Octo-
ber 1.

Composite data

For tables in this report, data from 
several sources were match-merged to
supplement a single data source with
information from other available data
sources.  For instance, records of 
appeals filed and terminated in U.S. 
courts of appeals provided by the 
AOUSC were match-merged with data 
describing defendants processed in 
U.S. district courts.  The district 
court data corresponding to 
appellate records were match-
merged with USSC data files on
defendants sentenced.

For appeals filed and terminated in 
U.S. courts of appeal, approximately 
95% of records were successfully 
matched with the original district 
court proceeding record.                 
              
The match rate with the USSC data files
was less complete.  Of the 9,234 appeals
filed during 1999 that represented cases
terminated in U.S. district courts as of
September 30, 1999, approximately 80%
of the appellate records were matched
with a USSC sentencing record.

Data describing the type of counsel, 
mode of conviction, and sentence 
imposed were extracted from the AOUSC 
data describing district court 
terminations. Data describing the 
applicability of mandatory minimum 
sentences and departures from the 
Federal sentencing guidelines were 
extracted from USSC sentencing records.  
The original appellate data files 
included data on the type of offense 
for which the defendant was originally 
convicted.

Data from the Federal Justice 
Statistics Program are compiled by 
the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
from the source files of several 
Federal agencies.  Data can be
obtained on CD-ROM from the Bureau
of Justice Statistics Clearinghouse,
