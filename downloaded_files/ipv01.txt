According to estimates from the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS), there were 691,710 nonfatal violent
victimizations committed by current or former spouses,
boyfriends, or girlfriends of the victims during 2001.  Such
crimes -- intimate partner violence -- primarily involve female
victims.  About 588,490, or 85% of victimizations by intimate
partners in 2001 were against women.

Intimate partner violence made up 20% of violent crime against
women in 2001.  By contrast, during the year intimate partners
committed 3% of all nonfatal violence against men. (See
Criminal Victimization 2001, Changes 2000-01, with Trends
1993-2001, NCJ 194610, for more information on
victim-offender relationship.)

Updating Intimate Partner Violence (May 2000, NCJ 178247),
these  findings are based on NCVS data collected by the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).  The NCVS inquires about
criminal victimizations from an ongoing nationally 
representative sample of household residents in the United 
States.  Violent acts examined include rape, sexual assault, 
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault.

Trends in nonfatal intimate partner 
violence, 1993-2001

The rate of intimate violence against females declined 
significantly between 1993 and 2001, dropping by nearly half 
(49%). The rate of intimate violence against males fell 42% 
between 1993 and 2001. These percent changes in rates
of intimate partner violence for women and men were not
measurably different.

Fatal intimate partner violence, 1976-2000

The number of men murdered by intimates dropped 68% between 
1976 and 2000, the year of the most recently available data.  
In 1976, an intimate murdered 1,357 men; in 2000, 440. 

The number of women killed by an intimate was stable for two
decades but declined after 1993.  Between 1976 and 2000 the 
number of women murdered by intimates fell 22% from 1,600 to 
1,247.

In recent years, generally, about 33% of female murder victims 
but 4% of the males were killed by an intimate.

Between 1993 and 2000 the proportion of all male murder victims
killed by an intimate was relatively stable while the proportion 
of female murder victims killed by an intimate increased slightly.
