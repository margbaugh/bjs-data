Highlights

Changes in the tort caseloads of U.S. district 
courts primarily related to litigation involving 
asbestos and other product liability claims

*  U.S. district courts terminated approximately 
512,000 civil cases during fiscal years 2002-03. 
Nearly 20% or 98,786 of these cases were torts in 
which plaintiffs claimed injury, loss, or damage 
from a defendant's negligent or intentional acts.  

*  Of the 98,786 tort cases terminated in U.S. 
district courts in 2002-03, about 2% or 1,647 
cases were decided by a bench or jury trial.

*  An estimated 9 out of 10 tort trials involved 
personal injury issues -- most frequently, product 
liability, motor vehicle (accident), marine, and 
medical malpractice cases.

*  Juries decided about 71% of all tort cases brought 
to trial in U.S. district courts; judges adjudicated 
the remaining 29%.

*  Plaintiffs won in 48% of tort trials terminated 
in U.S. district courts in 2002-03. Plaintiffs won 
less frequently in medical malpractice (37%) and 
product liability (34%)trials.

*  Eighty-four percent of plaintiff winners received
monetary damages with an estimated median award of
$201,000. 

*  Plaintiffs won more often in bench (54%) than 
in jury (46%) tort trials. The estimated median 
damage awards were higher in jury ($244,000) than 
in bench ($150,000)tort trials.

U.S. district courts terminated approximately 512,000
civil cases during fiscal years 2002-03. Nearly 20% 
or 98,786 of these cases were tort claims in which 
plaintiffs claimed injury, loss, or damage resulting 
from a defendant's negligent or intentional acts. Bench 
and jury trials accounted for about 2% (1,647) of tort 
cases terminated in U.S. district courts during this 
period. 

From 1985 to 2003 the number of tort trials terminated 
in U.S. district courts declined 79%. Juries decided about
71% of tort trials in 2002-03, while judges adjudicated 
the remainder.  Plaintiffs won in almost half of tort 
trials, and the estimated median award garnered by 
plaintiff winners in these trials was $201,000. Personal 
injury claims comprised almost 90% of tort trials in U.S. 
district courts and property damage cases accounted for 
the remaining 10%. Almost two-thirds of tort trials were 
disposed of within 2 years of the filing date.

These are some of the findings from a report presenting
data on tort cases decided by a jury or bench trial in U.S.
district courts during fiscal years 2002 and 2003. Data for
this 2-year period were combined to provide a larger
number of cases for detailed analysis. Previously, the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reported findings from
a study of tort trials terminated in U.S. district courts
during fiscal years 1994-95 and 1996-97.***Footnote 1:
See Federal Tort Trials and Verdicts, 1994 – 95, (NCJ
165810), and Federal Tort Trials and Verdicts, 1996–97,
(NCJ 172855). Data for this report were based on
information compiled by the AOUSC. The AOUSC Federal 
database can be downloaded from the National Archive of 
Criminal Justice Data <www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD>.***

This report focuses primarily on tort cases terminated by
trial in U.S. district courts during fiscal years 2002-03 
as well as trends in tort cases terminated in U.S. district
courts since 1970. Analysis is limited to those cases
terminated after the completion of a trial by jury or a 
trial before a district judge or magistrate judge. According 
to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC), a
trial is considered complete when a verdict is returned by
a jury or a decision is rendered by the court.***Footnote
2: The 2 variables in the AOUSC Federal data file that
can be used to identify jury and bench trials are
disposition "DISP" and procedural progress "PROCPROG." In 
its annual report the AOUSC uses the procedural progress 
codes to classify bench and jury trials. This report 
maintains consistency with the AOUSC by counting as trials 
cases with procedural progress codes of 8 or 9. The 
disposition codes are not used to identify jury and bench 
trials.*** Jury or bench trials terminated before verdict 
or judgment were excluded from this analysis. Tort cases 
that were settled, dismissed, or disposed through summary 
judgment in the Federal district courts were not reported. 

In previous publications BJS has reported on civil
litigation in the State courts where the vast majority of 
the Nation's civil caseloads are disposed.***Footnote 3: The
National Center for State Courts (NCSC) reports that in
2002 16.3 million civil cases were filed in State courts of
general (7.7 million) and limited (8.6 million) jurisdiction.
In comparison, 274,841 civil cases were filed in Federal
district courts during fiscal year 2002. NCSC, Examining
the Work of State Courts, 2003: A National Perspective
from the Court Statistics Project, Williamsburg, VA, and
AOUSC, 2002 Annual Report of the Director: Judicial
Business of the U.S. Courts, Washington, D.C.*** Tort
trials in U.S. district courts are also important to examine
because this litigation affects individuals, corporations,
and government officials across the United States and in
different countries. The availability of Federal data from
the 1970's allows for an examination of nearly 35 years
of tort trial trends in the Federal courts. Data for this 
time period are generally not available for tort trials in 
the State courts. Federal tort trials also offer another venue
for examining plaintiff win rates, damage award amounts, and 
other key case outcomes for this type of civil litigation. 
In most tort cases that settle at the State or Federal level, 
these details are typically not available. 

Tort cases terminated in U.S. district 
courts since 1970

After steadily increasing during the 1980's, the annual
number of tort cases terminated in U.S. district courts
has been marked by sharp swings throughout the 1990's
and early 2000's.

Asbestos and nonasbestos product liability cases have
contributed substantially to the changes in tort caseloads
in U.S. district courts. In the early 1990's thousands of
asbestos cases were terminated in individual Federal
district courts and then transferred through multidistrict
litigation into one Federal judicial district. As a result 
of this multidistrict transfer, asbestos case terminations
peaked at about 25,700 cases during the early 1990's.
Afterwards, asbestos case terminations declined to an
average of about 6,800 dispositions during each fiscal
year between 1993 and 2001. Asbestos case terminations 
climbed again in fiscal years 2002 and 2003 when each year 
there were on average approximately 14,400 cases terminated 
in U.S. district courts. 

Nonasbestos product liability cases also influenced the
increase of tort caseloads in U.S. district courts during
the late 1990's. Most of the rise in nonasbestos product
liability cases can be attributed to a transfer of breast
implant cases by multidistrict litigation from multiple
Federal district courts into a single Federal judicial
district.***Footnote 4:  For source details see AOUSC,
Judicial Business of the U.S. Courts, 1992, Judicial
Business of the U.S. Courts, 1999, and Judicial Business
of the U.S. Courts, 2002.***

Tort trials terminated in U.S. district 
courts since 1970

After falling slightly during the 1970's, the overall 
number of tort trials increased more than 50% from 
2,315 in 1980 to 3,604 in 1985. A substantial portion 
of this growth can be attributed to an increase in 
asbestos product liability trials.***Footnote 5: The 
separation of asbestos from product liability cases began 
in fiscal year 1984 but was not completed until the late 
1980's. An increase in asbestos trial litigation in the 
mid-1980's, which at that time was not counted separately, 
contributed to the rise of tort trials during that period.***

From 1985 to 2003 the overall number of tort trials has
declined 79%. Tort trials fell to 2,108 in 1990 and then 
to 1,147 in 2000. By 2003 U.S. district courts terminated
fewer than 800 tort cases by trial. Tort cases decided by
trial as a percentage of all tort terminations have also
declined from about 10% in 1985 to 2% in 2003.

The growing use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR)
is frequently cited as a primary contributor to the falling
trial rate. The AOUSC reports that in 2002 mediation and
arbitration programs were used in 49 Federal judicial
districts and impacted more than 25,000 civil cases.
Other legal scholars have speculated that the increased
complexity and costs inherent in taking a case to trial
have contributed to the decreasing number of trials in U.S. 
district courts.***Footnote 6: AOUSC, Judicial Business of 
the U.S. Courts, 2002, and Marc Galanter, "The Vanishing
Trial: An Examination of Trials and Related Matters in
Federal and State Courts," Journal of Empirical Legal
Studies, 1 (3), 2004, pp. 459-570.***

U.S. district court jurisdiction

Federal courts cannot decide a tort case unless the
criteria for Federal subject matter jurisdiction are met.
Federal subject matter jurisdiction refers to the legal
basis that allows a civil case to be filed and adjudicated
in the U.S. district courts. U.S. district courts exercise
jurisdiction in civil actions that --
(1) deal with a Federal question arising from the
interpretation and application of the U.S. Constitution,
acts of Congress, or treaties ("Federal
question")***Footnote 7: Title 28 U.S.C. sec 1331.*** or
(2) exceed $75,000 and are between parties (citizens
and/or corporations) residing in different States or parties
of a State and citizens, corporations, or subjects of a
foreign country ("diversity of citizenship")***Footnote 8:
Title 28 U.S.C. sec 1332. The minimum value required was
$10,000 until 1989 and $50,000 until 1996, when it was
raised to $75,000 in P.L. 104-317, Federal Courts
Improvement Act.*** or
(3) are initiated by the U.S. Government ("U.S.
Plaintiff")***Footnote 9: Title 28 U.S.C. sec 1345. or
(4) are brought against the U.S. Government for alleged
negligent or wrongful acts resulting in personal 
injury or property damage ("U.S. Defendant").***Footnote
10: Title 28 U.S.C. sec 1346.***

Diversity of citizenship was the jurisdictional basis 
for nearly two-thirds of the 1,647 tort trials 
terminated in U.S. district courts during fiscal years 
2002-03. Federal questions provided the jurisdictional 
criteria for 21% of tort trials, while the U.S. 
Government was the defendant in 12% of tort trials in 
U.S. district courts. Jurisdiction based on the U.S. 
Government being the plaintiff accounted for less than 
1% of tort trials terminated in U.S. district courts. 

Diversity of citizenship cases accounted for at least 6 
out of 10 tort trials in U.S. district courts from 1970 
to 2003. The proportion of tort trials based on diversity
of citizenship increased during the 1980's and 1990's so
that by 1998 three-fourths of all tort trials involved
diversity of citizenship jurisdiction. By 2002–03, however,
the percentage of tort cases with diversity of citizenship
jurisdiction declined to about two-thirds of tort trials. 

From 1970 to 2003, tort cases in which the U.S. Government 
was sued as the defendant represented 9% to 15% of tort 
trials terminated in U.S. district courts. Federal 
question cases declined from an average of about 22% of 
tort trials during the 1970's and 1980's to an average 
of 17% of tort trials in the 1990's and early 2000's. 

Origin of tort trials

The majority (64%) of the 1,647 tort trials terminated 
in fiscal years 2002-03 originated in U.S. district 
courts. An additional 24% of tort trials were civil 
actions initiated in State courts but removed to a U.S. 
district court, 8% were reopened or reinstated, and 3% 
were transferred from another Federal district. About 
1% of tort trials were remanded from an appellate court 
or originated from multidistrict litigation.

The nature of suit in tort trials

For the purposes of this report, tort trials were 
organized into two case categories: personal injury 
and property damage cases. Personal injury involves 
injury to a person or to the reputation of a person, 
while property damage involves damage to one's personal 
or business property.

During 2002-03 personal injury cases accounted for 
nearly 90% of the 1,647 tort trials terminated in U.S.
district courts. Motor vehicle (20%) cases, which in this
report refer to accidents rather than defective products,
and product liability (13%) cases were some of the most
frequent types of personal injury tort trials, followed by
marine (10%) and medical malpractice (10%) cases. Personal 
injury cases classified as "Other" also accounted for a 
substantial proportion (28%) of tort trials.

Type of trial termination: bench or jury

Federal civil trials can be decided by either a jury
comprised of 6 to 12 members (jury trial) or a Federal
district judge or magistrate judge (bench trial). The
plaintiff or defendant may request that the case be
decided by a jury trial. A jury verdict for either the 
plaintiff or defendant must be unanimous and cannot be 
taken from a jury with fewer than six members.***Footnote 
11: Title 28 Federal Rules of Civil Procedure sec 38.***   
If no request for a jury trial is made by either party, 
the case is tried by a bench trial. Federal law also 
stipulates that bench trials be required for most cases 
in which the United States is named as the defendant.
***Footnote 12: Title 28 U.S.C. sec 2402.*** 

About 7 out of 10 tort trials terminated in U.S. district
courts during fiscal years 2002-03 were decided by a
jury. Judges decided the remaining 30% of tort trials in
U.S. district courts during this period. Whether the tort
trial was terminated before a judge or jury varied by the
basis for Federal jurisdiction. Juries handled nearly 90%
of tort trials in which Federal jurisdiction was based on
diversity of citizenship and 61% of tort trials in which a
Federal question brought the case into U.S. district court.
Judges, in comparison, decided 95% of the 205 tort trials
in which the U.S. Government was sued. 

The type of trial termination also differed according to 
the nature of the suit . A jury decided about 73% of tort 
trials involving a personal injury issue. The personal 
injury case categories with the highest rates of jury 
trial terminations included product liability (90%),
assault/libel/slander (89%), Federal employers' liability
(84%), other personal injury (77%), and personal injury
motor vehicle (74%) cases. Judges, in comparison,
decided at least 40% of personal injury trials with a
marine or medical malpractice claim. The bench trial rate
for property damage cases was also 40%.

Trial terminations: Plaintiff winners

During fiscal years 2002-03, plaintiffs won almost half 
of tort trials terminated in U.S. district courts. 
Plaintiff win rates were fairly similar in both personal 
injury (48%) and property damage (49%) tort trials.

Plaintiffs prevailed in over half of personal injury 
tort trials involving Federal employers' liability (69%), 
motor vehicle (57%), and marine (54%)claims. In comparison,
plaintiffs won less frequently in assault/libel/slander
(38%), medical malpractice (37%), and product liability
(34%) tort trials decided in U.S. district courts.

The plaintiff win rates also varied considerably among
property damage trials. Plaintiffs won in 61% of fraud
property damage trials. In property damage trials
involving product liability issues, less than a third 
of plaintiffs prevailed.

Trial terminations: Monetary 
damage awards

Plaintiffs who prevail in tort trials are typically 
awarded compensatory awards for economic and 
noneconomic damages. Economic damages include financial 
losses stemming from the defendant's negligent conduct, 
while noneconomic damages encompass damages resulting
from the pain, suffering, or emotional distress 
negligently inflicted by the defendant on the plaintiff. 
Distinct from compensatory awards, punitive damages are 
reserved almost exclusively for tort claims in which the
defendant's conduct was grossly negligent or intentional.
Punitive damages tend to be awarded infrequently in tort
trials.***Footnote 13:In the tables and text presented in
the next several sections, award amounts include both
compensatory and punitive damages. Because of the nature 
of the data, the compensatory and punitive damage award 
amounts could not be separated.*** 

In 590 or 84% of the 704 tort trials in which the  
plaintiffs prevailed, the jury or court awarded damages 
(not shown in a table). This varied little across the 
tort case types. Plaintiffs were awarded damages in 84% 
of personal injury trials and 81% of property damage 
trials in which they prevailed.***Footnote 14: Award 
data were not available for all plaintiff winners 
because the award field is not mandatory for data entry. 
In addition, some plaintiff winners were awarded attorneys' 
fees and court costs, while others were awarded in the 
form of an injunction. These plaintiffs were also not 
counted as award winners.***

The estimated median damage award garnered by plaintiff 
winners for all tort trials in U.S. district courts
during fiscal years 2002-03 was $201,000.***Footnote
15: In this report the median awards should be
understood as estimates rather than as exact award
amounts. For further discussion of the award statistics,
see Methodology on page 11.***  The median damage award 
for personal injury tort trials was $181,000, while for 
property damage trials, the median damage award was 
$321,000. 

In half of the 49 medical malpractice trials that produced
monetary damages for prevailing plaintiffs, the award
amount was $600,000 or above. The median award for
plaintiff winners in personal injury motor vehicle trials
was $164,000 and for product liability trials was
$350,000.

Trial terminations: Plaintiff winners, 
damage awards, and case 
processing times for jury 
and bench trials

The plaintiff win rates, damage award amounts, and case 
processing times varied by whether the trial took place 
before a jury or judge. Plaintiffs overall tended to win 
more often in bench (54%) than in jury (46%) tort trials. 
Personal injury cases also manifested higher plaintiff 
win rates in judge (56%) trials than in jury (45%) tort 
trials. In property damage trials however, the 
percentage of prevailing plaintiffs was greater in jury
(53%) than in bench (42%) trials. 

Although judges found for plaintiffs more often than
juries, the estimated median damage award was higher
in jury ($244,000) than in bench ($150,000) tort 
trials. The award differences were particularly 
striking between jury and bench property damage trials. 
Among the 45 property damage jury trials with 
prevailing plaintiffs, the median award was $700,000; 
in comparison, the 18 property damage bench trials with 
plaintiff winners generated a median damage award amount 
of $196,000.

Diversity of citizenship tort trials

Diversity of citizenship served as the basis of Federal
jurisdiction for nearly two-thirds of tort trials 
terminated in U.S. district courts in 2002-03. Of these 
1,091 diversity of citizenship tort trials, 59% involved 
individual U.S. citizens bringing suit as plaintiffs 
against U.S. businesses as defendants. An additional 31% 
of these trials dealt with U.S. citizens from different 
States suing each other, and about 3% were between U.S. 
businesses in different States. The plaintiff was a 
foreign citizen in about 2% of diversity of citizenship 
trials, while a foreign nation was the plaintiff in one 
of these trials during fiscal years 2002-03. 

Plaintiffs won in 45% or 447 diversity of citizenship tort
trials in 2002-03 (table 10). Plaintiff winners received
monetary awards in 82% of diversity of citizenship tort
trials with an estimated median damage award of $232,000. 
The median damage awards, however, varied according to 
the type of case litigated. Among the personal injury 
diversity trials, the median damage awards were highest 
for plaintiff winners in medical malpractice ($663,000) 
and product liability motor vehicle ($548,000) trials. 
In personal injury motor vehicle trials, the median 
damage award for the 114 trials with prevailing 
plaintiffs was $159,000.

Federal question tort trials

In fiscal years 2002-03 U.S. district courts terminated
345 tort trials that involved a Federal question.
Eighty-five percent of these trials dealt with personal
injury matters, relating particularly to marine personal
injury (138 trials) and Federal employers' liability 
(72 trials) cases (not shown in a table). Plaintiffs won 
in 55% or 158 Federal question tort trials and received 
monetary awards in 136 of these cases. The estimated 
median damage award among plaintiff winners in tort 
trials involving a Federal question was $179,000.

Case processing time

About two-thirds of tort cases disposed of by trial in 
U.S. district courts were completed within 2 years after 
filing of the initial complaint. An additional 30% of 
tort trials were terminated within 3 to 4 years, while 
5% took 5 years or more to dispose.

The median case processing times did not differ
appreciably for tort cases terminated by jury or bench
trial. The median time period from filing to disposition
was 20 months for jury trials and 19 months for bench
trials terminated in U.S. district courts during fiscal 
years 2002-03.

Tort trials involving the U.S. 
Government as defendant

The Federal Tort Claims Act governs tort actions 
against the U.S. Government. This act provides the 
legal mechanism for compensating persons injured by 
the negligent or wrongful acts of Federal employees
committed within the scope of their employment. An
administrative claim to the appropriate Federal agency 
is a prerequisite to filing suit in U.S. district court. 
The claimant can file suit in U.S. district court only 
if the claim is denied by the Federal agency in writing 
or if the Federal agency does not make a decision about 
the claim within 6 months. Most lawsuits under the act 
can only be tried by bench trial.***Footnote 16: Title 
28 U.S.C. sec 2671 - 2680.***

The Torts Branch of the Civil Division within the
Department of Justice represents the United States, 
its agencies, and officers sued in tort actions. This 
includes suits against the United States under the 
Federal Tort Claims Act, the Public Vessels Act, all 
admiralty suits, and common law suits against individual 
government employees.***Footnote 17: Title 28 U.S.C. 
sec 2679. Urban A. Lester and Michael F. Noone, 
Litigation with the Federal Government, 3rd edition. 
Philadelphia: The American Law Institute, 1994.***  

During fiscal years 2002-03, the U.S. Government was
the defendant in 205 tort trials terminated in U.S. 
district courts. These cases were mostly personal
injury cases related to motor vehicles, medical
malpractice, and other personal injury cases. Plaintiffs 
won in slightly over half of tort trials against the U.S.
Government, and the estimated median amount awarded in 
these cases was $196,000. Half of the plaintiffs who 
prevailed in the 25 medical malpractice trials against 
the U.S. Government in fiscal years 2002-03 were awarded 
damages of at least $550,000.

------------------------------------------
Medical malpractice trials in U.S. 
district courts, 1990-2003

From 1990 to 2003, plaintiffs received monetary
damages in an average of 28% of medical malpractice
trials concluded in U.S. district courts. The 
estimated median awards ranged from $306,000 in 
1994 to over $1 million in 1990, 1991, and 2003.
-----------------------------------------------

Asbestos and nonasbestos product 
liability trials terminated in U.S. 
district courts, 1990–2003

Nonasbestos product liability trials have declined by
about two-thirds from 279 trials in 1990 to 87 trials 
in 2003.***Footnote 18:The number of asbestos and
nonasbestos product liability trials in tables 12 and 
13 are limited to trials in which the plaintiff winner 
could be determined.***  

On average, plaintiffs prevailed in nearly a third of
nonasbestos product liability trials during this period. 
This is lower than the overall plaintiff win rate of 
about 50% in tort trials in U.S. district courts. The 
estimated median damage awards garnered by plaintiff 
winners in nonasbestos product liability trials exceeded 
$1 million in fiscal year 2000. In 7 of the 14 fiscal 
years examined, the median awards in nonasbestos product 
liability trials ranged from $500,000 to less than $1 
million in damages. 

Although asbestos cases account for a substantial
portion of tort litigation in U.S. district courts, few 
of these cases are terminated by trial. After increasing 
from 87 trials in 1990 to 271 trials in 1991, the number 
of asbestos trials has declined substantially. Since 1991 
in the U.S. district courts, a judge or jury has decided 
an average of five asbestos cases per year. In 2000, 2002,
and 2003 there were no asbestos trials in which plaintiff
winners could be identified in the Federal district courts.
On average, plaintiffs won in nearly 3 out of 4 asbestos
product liability trials.

Methodology

The primary source of data presented in this report is 
the Federal Judicial Center's Integrated Data Base(Civil).
Data tabulations were prepared from the BJS staff
analysis of source agency data sets. The Federal civil
tort categories used in this report are based primarily on
the codes established by the Administrative Office of the
United States Courts (AOUSC). Case level information is
provided by individual U.S. district courts, which submit
data to the AOUSC. The categories for types of cases in
this report are based on those defined by the AOUSC.
As a result no detailed information is available on the
number of "other personal injury" cases and "other product 
liability cases." For tort cases that involved more than 
one type of action filed, the AOUSC instructs the 
plaintiff's attorney if the cause fits more than one 
nature of suit, to select the most definitive. It is the 
first nature of the suit code that was used in the 
analysis for this report.

For tort cases where more than one basis of jurisdiction
applies, the case was coded according to the highest
priority jurisdiction that applies. Cases in which the 
U.S. Government is the plaintiff have the highest priority,
followed by the U.S. Government as defendant, Federal
questions, diversity of citizenship cases, then local
questions. Calculations pertaining to plaintiff winners 
and their award amounts were based on cases for which the
plaintiff or defendant winner was known. The plaintiff
winner category does not include instances where both
parties won the case.

Note on fiscal years

The AOUSC reports on Federal caseloads by fiscal
rather than calendar year. The period covered by a 
fiscal year changed in 1992. Prior to 1992 the 
fiscal year started on July 1 and ended on June 30 
of the next year. The change in 1992 resulted in the 
fiscal year beginning on October 1 and ending on 
September 30.

In BJS reports on tort trials terminated in U.S. 
district courts during fiscal years 1994-95 (NCJ 
165810) and 1996-97(NCJ 172855), the fiscal years 
1990, 1991, and 1992 were modified to reflect the 
current definition. This report maintains consistency 
with those earlier BJS reports: data for fiscal years 
1990-92 have the October-to- September format. The 
fiscal years during the 1970's and 1980's, however, 
have not been revised.

Note on damage awards

Damage award amounts are presented as estimates
limited by data coverage and quality issues. For 
further information about award variables see the 
AOUSC codebook at the National Archive of Criminal 
Justice Data <http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/index.
html>; the codebook is archived with studies 4026 
and 4059. Eisenberg and Schlanger audited the AOUSC 
damage award data by comparing the Federal data files 
to the Public Access to Court Electronic Records 
(PACER)docket sheets. They found that the median awards
offered a reasonable upper level estimate of the
damages awarded to prevailing plaintiffs. The AOUSC
median damage award for tort cases terminated by trial
was 10% higher ($151,000) compared to the $137,000
median award calculated from the PACER docket sheets.

Reliability of the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts Database: An Initial Empirical Analysis," Notre
Dame Law Review, 78(5) 2003, pp. 101-143.
