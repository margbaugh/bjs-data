Special Report

Workplace Violence Against Government Employees, 1994-2011

Erika Harrell, Ph.D., BJS Statistician

The annual average rate of workplace violence against local, county, 
state, and federal government employees declined 82% from 1994 to 2011, 
compared to a decline of 72% for the private-sector (figure 1). Most of 
the decline (76%) occurred between 1994 and 2002, when the rate of 
workplace violence against government employees dropped from 99.2 violent 
victimizations per 1,000 to 24.2 per 1,000. The rate dropped an 
additional 25.6% from 2002 to 2011. In 2011, the rate of workplace 
violence against government employees was more than three times the rate 
for private-sector employees.

In 1994, the rate of violent victimization in the workplace of government 
employees (99.2 per 1,000) was over five times greater than the rate for 
employees in the private-sector (18.5 per 1,000). From 1994 to 2011, the 
annual average rate of workplace violence against government employees 
was at least twice that for private-sector employees.  The study period 
ended in 2011 with the rate of workplace violence for government 
employees (18.0 per 1,000) lower than its levels of the mid 1990s but was 
over three times greater than the rate for private-sector employees (5.2 
per 1,000).

*******************************************************************
Highlights

*******************************************************************

* In 2011, government employees had a rate of workplace violence (18.0 
per 1,000 employees age 16 or older) that was more than three times the 
rate for private-sector employees (5.2 per 1,000). 

* About 56% of government employee workplace violence from 2002 to 2011 
was attributed to those working in law enforcement and security-related 
occupations.

* From 2002 to 2011, the annual average rate of simple assault in the 
workplace against government employees (18.9 per 1,000) was more than 
three times that of private-sector employees (4.6 per 1,000). 

* In 2011, excluding law enforcement and security employees, the rate of 
workplace violence against government employees (8.7 per 1,000) was 
greater than the rate for private-sector employees (4.7 per 1,000).

* Serious violent crime accounted for a larger percentage of workplace 
violence against private-sector employees (25%)than government employees 
(15%). 

* In 2011, about 1 in 5 victims of workplace homicide was a government 
employee.

* From 2002 to 2011, about 96% of workplace violence against government 
employees was against state, county, and local employees, who made up 81% 
of the total government workforce.

* Persons working in law enforcement and security occupations in 
government (140.3 per 1,000) and private-sector organizations (102.5 per 
1,000)had the highest annual average rates of violent victimization 
occurring in the workplace from 2002 to 2011.

********************************************************************	

The higher rates of workplace violence in the government were partly due 
to the high rates of workplace violence attributed to law enforcement and 
security employees (figure 2).  The rate of workplace violence for law 
enforcement and security employees was a high of 672.3 per 1,000 in 1994, 
declining to 109.3 in 2011. These law enforcement and security 
occupations accounted for over half of the violence committed against 
government workers and were concentrated most heavily in state, county, 
and local government.

The estimates of nonfatal violent victimization in the workplace against 
government employees are based on data from the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics? (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which 
collects information on nonfatal crimes against persons age 12 or older, 
reported and not reported to the police, from a nationally representative 
sample of U.S. households. In this report, nonfatal workplace violence 
includes rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault (serious 
violent offenses), and simple assault against employed persons age 16 or 
older that occurred while at work or on duty. Information on workplace 
homicide in this report was obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics? 
(BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) (see Methodology). 
Workplace homicide includes the homicide of employed victims age 16 or 
older who were killed while at work or on duty and excludes death by 
accident.

Trend estimates of nonfatal workplace violence are based on 2-year 
rolling averages centered on the most recent year. For example, estimates 
reported for 2011 represent the average estimates for 2010 and 2011. For 
some tables in this report, the focus is on the single 10-year aggregate 
period from 2002 through 2011. These approaches increase the reliability 
and stability of estimates, which facilitates comparisons over time and 
between subgroups. Trend estimates of workplace homicide are based on a 
single most recent year estimates. For example, estimates of workplace 
homicide for 2011 represent the estimate for 2011 only.
 
*******************************************************************
The rate of workplace violence against all types of government employees 
fell between 1994 and 2011
*******************************************************************

From 2002 to 2011, government employees accounted for 16% of all employed 
persons age 16 or older and were victims of about 41% of the nonfatal 
workplace violence (table 1). Most (96%) of the workplace violence 
against government employees occurred against persons employed by state, 
county, and local governments (not shown in table). State, county, and 
local government employees accounted for 81% of all government employees, 
and federal employees made up 19%. Federal employees experienced 2% of 
all workplace violence and 4% of workplace violence against all 
government employees.

Among persons in law enforcement and security occupations, there was no 
statistically significant difference in the rates of workplace violence 
against government and private-sector employees in 2011. Between 1994 and 
2011, the rate of workplace violence against government law enforcement 
and security employees dropped 84% from 672.3 per 1,000 in 1994 to 109.3 
per 1,000 in 2011. In comparison, the rate of workplace violence against 
private-sector law enforcement and security employees declined 52%, from 
182.3 per 1,000 in 1994 to 87.5 per 1,000 in 2011.

Excluding law enforcement and security employees, the rate of workplace 
violence against government employees (8.7 per 1,000) was higher than 
that of private-sector employees (4.7 per 1,000) in 2011(figure 3). The 
rate of workplace violence against non-law enforcement and security 
government employees dropped 80% from 1994 to 2011, compared to a 73% 
decline for non-law enforcement and security private-sector employees.

In 2011, the rate of workplace violence against state, county, and local 
employees (21.6 per 1,000) was more than five times the rate of federal 
employees (3.7 per  1,000) (figure 4). Between 1994 and 2011, the rate of 
workplace violence against federal employees dropped 78%, from 16.7 per 
1,000 in 1994 to 3.7 per 1,000. In comparison, the rate of workplace 
violence declined 82% for state, county, and local employees during the 
same period, from 122.4 per 1,000 in 1994 to 21.6 per 1,000 in 2011.

As with the overall rate of violence against government workers, the rate 
of violence against state, local, and city government employees was 
driven in part by the high rates associated with law enforcement and 
security employees.

Among non-law enforcement and security government employees, those 
employed by state, county, and local governments had a rate of workplace 
violence (10.0 per 1,000) that was more than twice that of federal 
employees (3.6 per 1,000) in 2011.  From 1994 to 2011, the rate of 
workplace violence declined 69% for non-law enforcement and security 
federal employees and 82% for non-law enforcement and security employees 
of state, county, and local governments.

*****************************************************************
Except transportation, the rate of workplace violence was higher for 
government employees than private-sector employees for each measured 
occupation 
*****************************************************************

From 2002 to 2011, about 56% of workplace violence against government 
employees occurred against persons in law enforcement and security 
occupations (table 2). Persons in law enforcement and security-related 
fields accounted for about 9% of all government employees. In comparison, 
persons working in teaching occupations experienced about 14% of 
workplace violence from 2002 to 2011, and accounted for about 34% of 
government employees.

Persons working in law enforcement and security occupations had the 
highest annual average rate of workplace violence among government (140.3 
per 1,000) and private-sector employees (102.5 per 1,000). No difference 
was detected in the annual average rate of workplace violence against 
government and private-sector employees who worked in transportation 
occupations. For all other occupations measured, the annual average rate 
of workplace violence was higher for government employees than private-
sector employees. 

*******************************************************************
Government employees experienced simple assault at more than three times 
the rate of private-sector employees 
*******************************************************************

From 2002 to 2011, the annual average rate of workplace violence against 
government employees (22.3 per 1,000) was more than three times the rate 
for private-sector employees (6.2 per 1,000) (table 3). During the same 
10-year period, the annual average rate of simple assault in the 
workplace against government employees (18.9 per 1,000) was more than 
three times that of private-sector employees (4.6 per 1,000). Similarly, 
the rate of serious violence (rape/sexual assault, robbery, and 
aggravated assault) was greater for government (3.4 per 1,000) than 
private-sector employees (1.6 per 1,000).

Government employees experienced an annual average of about 528,000 
nonfatal violent crimes in the workplace during the 10-year period from 
2002 to 2011, compared to an annual average 760,000 against private-
sector employees. Serious violent crime accounted for a larger percentage 
of workplace violence against private-sector employees (25%) than 
government employees (15%).


******************************************************************
In 2011, one in every five victims of workplace homicide was a government 
employee
******************************************************************

From 1993 to 2002, the number of government employees who were victims of 
workplace homicide declined by 33%, from 124 in 1993 to 83 in 2002 
(figure 5). For private-sector employees, homicide declined 44%, from 944 
in 1993 to 525 in 2002. From 2003 to 2010, government employees 
experienced a 29% increase in the number of homicides, from 71 in 2003 to 
86 in 2010. During the same period, homicide in private-sector employees 
decreased by 28%, from 560 in 2003 to 432 in 2010. In 2011, the private-
sector experienced 367 homicides compared to 90 homicides for government 
employees.

******************************************************************
Male government employees experienced a higher rate of the workplace 
violence than females
******************************************************************

For most of the victim characteristics measured, government employees had 
a higher rate of workplace violence than private-sector employees. Among 
government employees, males (35.3 per 1,000) had a rate of workplace 
violence that was over twice the rate of females (12.0 per 1,000) due 
primarily to the large percentage of males working in law enforcement 
and security-related government occupations (table 4). Persons of two or 
more races had the highest rate of workplace violence among government 
employees. Among government employees, whites were more likely than 
blacks, Hispanics, and Asians to be victims of workplace violence. 
Government employees ages 25 to 34 had the highest rate of workplace 
violence (35.8 per 1,000). Government employees who were divorced or 
separated had the highest rate of workplace violence (33.5 per 1,000) 
among all marital statuses. Among government employees, persons with 
annual household incomes of $50,000 to $74,999 had the highest rate of 
workplace violence (33.6 per 1,000) among all income categories. 

Among non-law enforcement and security employees, government employees 
had a higher rate of workplace violence (10.8 per 1,000) than private-
sector employees (5.6 per 1,000). No difference was found due to sex in 
the rates of workplace violence against non-law enforcement and security 
employees in the government or the private-sector. In both the government 
and private-sector, American Indian and Alaska Natives in non-law 
enforcement and security occupations had a higher rate of workplace 
violence than whites, blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in similar 
occupations.  Among government non-law enforcement and security 
employees, persons ages 25 to 64 had similar rates of workplace violence 
(11.7 per 1,000). 

******************************************************************
Among government and private-sector employees, males were more likely 
than females to be violently victimized in the workplace by a stranger 
*******************************************************************

With few exceptions, the distributions shown in the remainder of the 
report do not vary substantially after excluding law enforcement and 
security occupations or are limited by small sample sizes. Therefore, 
comparisons are shown by employment sector totals.

About 68% of workplace violence against male government employees was 
committed by strangers compared to 38% for female government employees 
(table 5). Among private-sector employees, males (60%) also had a higher 
percentage of workplace violence committed by strangers than females 
(42%). Among government and private-sector employees, a greater 
percentage of female victims of workplace violence than male victims were 
attacked by a person with whom the victim had a work relationship, such 
as a customer or client, patient, current or former supervisor, current 
or former employee, or current or former coworker. About 23% of violence 
committed against female government employees involved a work 
relationship, compared to 7% for male government employees. For both 
males and females, a larger percentage of violence was committed by 
casual acquaintances and persons well-known to the victim for government 
employees (between 20% and 33%) compared to private-sector employees 
(between 6% and 8%).

****************************************************************
Government employees experienced a lower percentage of workplace violence 
involving a weapon, compared to private-sector employees
****************************************************************

From 2002 to 2011, a smaller percentage of weapons were present in 
workplace violence against government employees (12%) than against 
private-sector employees (20%) (table 6). Two percent of workplace 
violence against government employees involved an offender with a 
firearm, compared to 6% for private-sector employees.

From 2002 to 2011, a similar percentage of government and private-sector 
victims were injured in workplace violence. No difference was observed in 
the percentages of government and private-sector employees (about 1 to 
2%) who suffered a serious injury (such as gunshot wounds, knife wounds, 
internal injuries, unconsciousness, broken bones, and other injuries that 
required hospitalization for more than 2 days) as a result of workplace 
violence (table 7).

*****************************************************************
The percentage of workplace violence against government employees that 
was reported to police declined from 1994 to 2011
*****************************************************************

From 1994 to 2011 (with the exception of 1999, 2003, and 2011), a greater 
percentage of workplace violence against government employees than that 
against private-sector employees was reported to the police. The 
percentage of workplace violence against government employees that was 
reported to police declined from 54% in 1994 to 35% in 2011 (figure 4). 
The percentage of workplace violence against private-sector employees 
reported to police fluctuated between 1994 and 2011. No difference was 
detected in the percentage of workplace violence against private-sector 
employees reported to police in 1994 and 2011.

The most common reason why workplace violence was not reported to police 
by a government employee was that the incident was reported to another 
official (60%) (table 8). Government employees were more likely to report 
an incidence of workplace violence to another official than private-
sector employees (30%). Government employees (13%) were less likely than 
private-sector employees (22%) to state that they did not report 
workplace violence to police because it was not important enough to the 
victim. 

***************************************************************
Methodology
***************************************************************

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an annual data 
collection conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (BJS). The NCVS is a self-report survey in which interviewed 
persons are asked about the number and characteristics of victimizations 
experienced during the prior 6 months. The NCVS collects information on 
nonfatal personal crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated 
assault, simple assault, and personal larceny) and household property 
crimes (burglary, motor vehicle theft, and other theft) both reported and 
not reported to police. In addition to providing annual level and change 
estimates on criminal victimization, the NCVS is the primary source of 
information on the nature of criminal victimization incidents. Survey 
respondents provide information about themselves (such as age, sex, race 
and ethnicity, marital status, education level, and income) and if they 
experienced a victimization. For crime victims, data are collected about 
each victimization incident, including information about the offender 
(such as age, race and ethnicity, sex, and victim-offender relationship), 
characteristics of the crime (including time and place of occurrence, use 
of weapons, nature of injury, and economic consequences), whether the 
crime was reported to police, reasons why the crime was or was not 
reported, and experiences with the law enforcement and security system.

The NCVS is administered to persons age 12 or older from a nationally 
representative sample of households in the United States. In 2011, about 
143,120 persons age 12 or older from 79,800 households across the country 
were interviewed during the year. Once selected, households remain in the 
sample for 3 years, and eligible persons in these households are 
interviewed every 6 months for a total of seven interviews. New 
households rotate into the sample on an ongoing basis to replace outgoing 
households that have been in sample for the 3-year period. The sample 
includes persons living in group quarters (such as dormitories, rooming 
houses, and religious group dwellings) and excludes persons living in 
military barracks and institutional settings (such as correctional or 
hospital facilities) and the homeless. (For more information, see the 
Survey Methodology for Criminal Victimization in the United States, 2008, 
BJS website, NCJ 231173, May 2011.)

The 79,800 households that participated in the NCVS in 2011 represent a 
90% household response rate. The person level response rate?the 
percentage of persons age 12 or older in participating households who 
completed an NCVS interview?was 88% in 2011. 

All victimizations that occurred outside of the U.S. were excluded. From 
1993 to 2011, less than 1% of the unweighted violent victimizations 
occurred outside of the U.S. and was excluded from the analyses.

*****************************************************************
Occupational categories in the NCVS
*****************************************************************

The NCVS began using the occupational categories displayed in this report 
after the 1992 redesign. In 2001, the employment questions were revised 
on the incidents form using the Industry and Occupation coding of the 
1990 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) coding system. However, the 
screening questionnaire remained the same. In order to generate rates of 
workplace violence by occupation, the occupation categories on the 
incident form were collapsed into occupation categories used on the 
screening questionnaire. Population estimates were generated from the 
screening questionnaire and incidents of workplace violence were 
generated using the collapsed categories from the incident form. The 
percentages of workplace violence presented in appendix table 15 were 
derived using the data on the incident form only. The other occupation 
group accounted for 12% of government workplace violence and 43% of 
private-sector workplace violence.***FOOTNOTE: *The NCVS classifies a 
limited number of occupations for all persons interviewed, but a more 
detailed set for those who experience a crime. The distribution of crime 
by occupational group is shown in appendix table 15.*** 


***************************************************************
Use of the NCVS to generate estimates of government employees
***************************************************************

For this report, BJS calculated rates of violent victimization in the 
workplace against government employees using information from the 
screening questionnaire of the NCVS. To determine the validity of the 
employment information gathered from the NCVS, BJS compared NCVS 
estimates of the age, sex, and racial distributions of government 
employees with those in the American Community Survey (ACS). No 
systematic differences were detected between the estimates from the two 
surveys, and as a result, the NCVS data were used to estimate all 
government employees.

***************************************************************
Weighting adjustments for estimating personal victimization
***************************************************************

Estimates in this report use data primarily from the 1993 to 2011 NCVS 
data files weighted to produce annual estimates for persons age 12 or 
older living in U.S. households. Because the NCVS relies on a sample 
rather than a census of the entire U.S. population, weights are designed 
to inflate sample point estimates to known population totals and to 
compensate for survey nonresponse and other aspects of the sample design.

The NCVS data files include both household and person weights. The 
household weight is commonly used to calculate estimates of property 
crimes, such as motor vehicle theft or burglary, which are identified 
with the household. Person weights provide an estimate of the population 
represented by each person in the sample. Person weights are most 
frequently used to compute estimates of crime victimizations of persons 
in the total population. Both household and person weights, after proper 
adjustment, are also used to form the denominator in calculations of 
crime rates.

The victimization weights used in this analysis account for the number of 
persons present during an incident and for repeat victims of series 
incidents. The weight counts series incidents as the actual number of 
incidents reported by the victim, up to a maximum of ten incidents. 
Series victimizations are victimizations that are similar in type but 
occur with such frequency that a victim is unable to recall each 
individual event or to describe each event in detail. Survey procedures 
allow NCVS interviewers to identify and classify these similar 
victimizations as series victimizations and collect detailed information 
on only the most recent incident in the series. In 2011, about 3% of all 
victimizations were series incidents.

Weighting series incidents as the number of incidents up to a maximum of 
ten produces more reliable estimates of crime levels, while the cap at 
ten minimizes the effect of extreme outliers on the rates. Additional 
information on the series enumeration is detailed in Methods for Counting 
High Frequency Repeat Victimizations in the National Crime Victimization 
Survey, BJS website, NCJ 237308, April 2012.

******************************************************************** 
Standard error computations 
********************************************************************

When national estimates are derived from a sample, as is the case with 
the NCVS, caution must be taken when comparing one estimate to another or 
comparing estimates over time. Although one estimate may be larger than 
another, estimates based on a sample have some degree of sampling error. 
The sampling error of an estimate depends on several factors, including 
the amount of variation in the responses, the size of the sample, and the 
size of the subgroup for which the estimate is computed. When the 
sampling error around the estimates is taken into consideration, the 
estimates that appear different may, in fact, not be statistically 
different.
 
One measure of the sampling error associated with an estimate is the 
standard error. The standard error can vary from one estimate to the 
next. In general, for a given metric, an estimate with a smaller standard 
error provides a more reliable approximation of the true value than an 
estimate with a larger standard error. Estimates with relatively large 
standard errors are associated with less precision and reliability and 
should be interpreted with caution.
 
In order to generate standard errors around estimates from the NCVS, the 
Census Bureau produces generalized variance function (GVF) parameters for 
BJS. The GVFs take into account aspects of the NCVS complex sample design 
and represent the curve fitted to a selection of individual standard 
errors based on the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The GVF 
parameters were used to generate standard errors for each point estimate 
(such as counts, percentages, and rates) in the report. For annual 
average estimates, standard errors were based on the ratio of the sums of 
victimizations and respondents across years.
 
In this report, BJS conducted tests to determine whether differences in 
estimated numbers and percentages were statistically significant once 
sampling error was taken into account. Using statistical programs 
developed specifically for the NCVS, all comparisons in the text were 
tested for significance. The primary test procedure used was Student?s t-
statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. To 
ensure that the observed differences between estimates were larger than 
might be expected due to sampling variation, the significance level was 
set at the 95% confidence level. 

Data users can use the estimates and the standard errors of the estimates 
provided in this report to generate a confidence interval around the 
estimate as a measure of the margin of error. The following example 
illustrates how standard errors can be used to generate confidence 
intervals:
 
According to the NCVS, from 2002 to 2011, 11.5% of violent victimizations 
in the workplace against government employees involved an offender with a 
weapon (see table 6). Using the GVFs, BJS determined that the estimate 
has a standard error of 0.8% (see appendix table 11). A confidence 
interval around the estimate was generated by multiplying the standard 
errors by ñ1.96 (the t-score of a normal, two-tailed distribution that 
excludes 2.5% at either end of the distribution). Therefore, the 
confidence interval around the 11.5% estimate from 2002 to 2011 is 11.5% 
ñ 0.8% X 1.96 (or 9.93% to 13.07%). In other words, if different samples 
using the same procedures were taken from the U.S. population in from 
2002 to 2011, 95% of the time the percentage of violent victimization in 
workplace against government employees involving an offender with a 
weapon would fall between 9.93% and 13.07%.

In this report, BJS also calculated a coefficient of variation (CV) for 
all estimates, representing the ratio of the standard error to the 
estimate. CVs provide a measure of reliability and a means to compare the 
precision of estimates across measures with differing levels or metrics. 
If the CV was greater than 50%, or the unweighted sample had 10 or fewer 
cases, the estimate would have been noted with a ?!? symbol (interpret 
data with caution; estimate is based on 10 or fewer sample cases, or the 
coefficient of variation exceeds 50%). 

Many of the variables examined in this report may be related to one 
another and to other variables not included in the analyses. Complex 
relationships among variables were not fully explored in this report and 
warrant more extensive analysis. Readers are cautioned not to draw causal 
inferences based on the results presented.

Methodological changes to the NCVS in 2006
*****************************************************************
 
Methodological changes implemented in 2006 may have affected the crime 
estimates for that year to such an extent that they are not comparable to 
estimates from other years. Evaluation of 2007 and later data from the 
NCVS conducted by BJS and the Census Bureau found a high degree of 
confidence that estimates for 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 are consistent 
with and comparable to estimates for 2005 and previous years. The reports

on the BJS website. Although caution is warranted when comparing data 
from 2006 to other years, the aggregation of multiple years of data in 
this report diminishes the potential variation between 2006 and other 
years. In general, findings do not change significantly if the year 2006 
is excluded from the analyses.

Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries
*************************************************************

Data on workplace homicide were obtained from the Census of Fatal 
Occupational Injuries (CFOI) collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics 
(BLS). CFOI produces comprehensive, accurate, and timely counts of fatal 
work injuries. CFOI is a federal-state cooperative program that has been 
implemented in all 50 states and the District of Columbia since 1992. 
Data from 1993 to 2010 are based on final data from the CFOI. Data from 
2003 to 2010 is not comparable with data from previous years, due to 
BLS?s decision to start using the North American Industry Classification 
System (NAICS) to define industries. Prior to 2003, the program used the 
Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system. Because of the 
substantial differences between NAICS and SIC, the results by industry 
beginning in 2003 constitute a break in series. Readers are advised 
against comparing data from 2003 to 2010 to data from 1993 to 2002. For 
2003 to 2008 data, the IIF program used the 2002 NAICS to classify 
industry. Since 2009, the IIF program has used the 2007 NAICS. (For more 
information on NAICS, see http://www.bls.gov/bls/naics.htm.) Data for 
2011 are not comparable with data from previous years, due to BLS?s major 
revision to the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification System 
(OIICS). The revised OIICS structure (OIICS 2.01) was used beginning with 
reference year 2011 for both the CFOI and the Survey of Occupational 
Injuries and Illnesses (SOII) programs. Because of the extensive 
revisions, data for the OIICS case characteristics for reference year 
2011 represent a break in series with data for prior years. (For more 
information, see http://www.bls.gov/iif/osh_notice11.htm.)

To compile counts that are as complete as possible, the CFOI uses 
multiple sources to identify, verify, and profile fatal worker injuries 
annually. Information about each fatal injury from all workplaces?
occupation and other worker characteristics, equipment involved, and 
circumstances of the event?is obtained by cross referencing the source 
records, such as death certificates, workers? compensation reports, and 
federal and state agency administrative reports. To ensure that fatal 
injuries are work-related, cases are substantiated with two or more 
independent source documents, or a source document and a follow-up 
questionnaire. Data compiled by the CFOI program are issued annually for 
the preceding calendar year. The National Safety Council has adopted the 
CFOI estimates, beginning with 1992, as the authoritative count for work-
related deaths in the United States. More information about CFOI can be 
found here: http//www.bls.gov/iif/oshfat1.htm.
