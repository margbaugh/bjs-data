Homicide rates recently declined to levels last seen
in the late 1960's. The Nation's homicide rate was 4.6
per 100,000 population in 1950. It doubled from the 
mid-1960's to the late 1970's. In 1980 it peaked at
10.2 and fell to 7.9 in 1985. It rose again in the late
1980's and early 1990's to another peak of 9.8 in
1991. After 1991 the homicide rate declined sharply.
In recent years the decline has slowed. The Nation's
murder rate was 5.5 in 2000 compared to 5.7 in
1999.

Homicide victimization, 1950-2000

From 1950 to 1964, the rate remains constant at around 4.5 
per 100,000. The rate increases to 9.8 per 100,000 in 1974. 
The rate dips slightly from 1975 to 1976, then increases 
to 10.2 in 1980. After 1981 it decreases reaching 8.3 per 
100,000 in 1983 and then increasing again to 9.8 per 100,000 
in 1991 where it remains constant until 1994. After 1994 it 
decreases sharply to 5.5 per 100,000
in 2000.

These findings and many more are from Homicide Trends 
in the United States, a section of the BJS web site 
that describes homicide patterns and trends in the 
United States since 1976. The site displays 50
graphics and supporting tables updated with the
2000 data. Homicide is of interest not only because
of its severity but also because it is considered by
experts to be a fairly reliable barometer of violent
crime. At a national level, no other crime is measured
as accurately and precisely.
 
For teens and young adults, homicide victimization
rates exploded in the late 1980's but fell dramatically
after 1993. During the same period, rates for older
people declined. From 1999 to 2000, rates for adults
ages 25-34 increased slightly while the rates for all
other age groups declined slightly. 

Graph: Victimization rates for teens and young adults increased
dramatically in the late 1980's while rates for older age 
groups declined.

Homicide victimization by age, 1976-2000

Line chart with six lines for the age groups: 
under 14, 14-17, 18-24, 25-34, 35-49, and 50+.

For persons under age 14, the rate of victimization 
begins at 2 per 100,000 in 1976 and remains constant 
through 1999, after which, it decreases to 1 per 
100,000 in 2000.

For persons ages 14-17, the rate of victimization 
begins at 5 per 100,000 in 1976 and gradually 
increases to 12 per 100,000 in 1993.  After 1993, 
the rate decreases, reaching 5 per 100,000 in 2000.

For persons ages 18-24, the rate of victimization 
begins at 14 per 100,000 in 1976 and increases to 
18 per 100,000 in 1980. Then it decreases to 13 
per 100,000 in 1984. The rate increases after 1984, 
reaching 24 per 100,000 in 1991 and remains relatively
constant until 1994, when it then begins to decrease 
reaching 15 per 100,000 in 2000.

For persons ages 25-34, the rate of victimization 
begins at 15 per 100,000 in 1976 and increases to 
19 per 100,000 in 1980. Then it decreases reaching 
14 per 100,000 in 1985. After 1985, the rate increases 
reaching 17 per 100,000 in 1990. After 1991, the rate
decreases reaching 10 per 100,000 in 2000.

For persons ages 35-49, the rate of victimization 
begins at 13 per 100,000 in 1976 where it remains 
constant until 1981, after which it begins to decrease, 
reaching 6 per 100,000 in 2000. 

For persons ages 50 and over, the rate of victimization 
begins at 7 per 100,000 in 1976 and remains constant 
until 1981. It then decreases, reaching 3 per 100,000 in 2000.

The homicide rates for teens reflect a reversal from
dramatic increases in the early 1990's. From 1976 to
1985, the rates for young teens (ages 14-17) were
below those for all older age groups. After 1995 they
rose to exceed the rates for persons age 35 or older.
They have now fallen back to levels below those of
persons ages 35-49 -- levels similar to those from
1976 to 1985 -- reversing one of the most dramatic
trends in homicide victimization.

The sharp increase in homicides in the late 1980's
and much of the subsequent decline were attributable 
to a rise and fall in gun violence by teens and young 
adults. Despite the moderation since 1993, the levels 
of gun homicides by teens and young adults remain 
well above those of the mid-1980's.

Graph: Gun homicides by teens and young adults rose
sharply beginning with the mid-1980's and have fallen
since 1993.

Homicide offending by age of offender and weapon 
use, 1976-2000 

Three charts: one each for age groups 14-17, 18-24,
and 25 and older

Ages 14-17 chart

Line chart with two lines: gun and nongun.

For gun, the number of homicide offenders begins at 
965 in 1976 and remains constant until 1986. After 1986 
it increases to a high of 3,337 in 1994. After that it 
decreases to 1,084 in 2000.

For nongun, the number of homicide offenders 
begins at 809 in 1976 and gradually decreases 
to 408 in 2000.

Ages 18-24 chart

Line chart with two lines: gun and nongun.

For gun, the number of homicide offenders begins at 
3,586 in 1976 and rises to 5,085 in 1980. Then it 
decreases to 3,335 in 1984, after which it increases 
sharply to 8,171 in 1993. 
Then it decreases to 5,162 in 2000. 

For nongun, the number of homicide offenders begins 
at 2,658 in 1976 and increases to 3,620 in 1980. 
It then decreases to 2,052 in 2000.

Ages 25+ chart

Line chart with two lines: gun and nongun

For gun, the number of homicide offenders begins 
at 8,413 in 1976 and rises sharply to 10,131 in 1980. 
From that high it decreases to 8,051 in 1983 and remains 
relatively constant until 1991, after which it decreases, 
reaching 4,976 in 2000. 

For nongun, the number of homicide offenders begins at 
3,817 in 1976 and gradually rises to 5,662 in 1991. 
After 1991 it decreases, reaching 3,912 in 2000.

Other major findings--

Gender
Males are most often the victims and the perpetrators
in homicides: males were 10 times more likely than
females to commit murder, and male and female
offenders were more likely to target male than female
victims.

Race
Blacks were 6 times more likely to be homicide victims 
and 7 times more likely than whites to commit homicides 
in 2000.

Eighty-six percent of white murder victims were killed
by whites, and 94% of black victims were killed by
blacks.

Among homicides in which the victim was killed by an
acquaintance, 1 in 10 were interracial, whereas when
the killer is a stranger, 3 in 10 were interracial.

Age, race, and gender
There were dramatic increases in both homicide
victimization and offending rates among young black
males in the late 1980's and 1990's before recent
declines in both categories.

From 1999 to 2000, older teens and young adults
and older adults from all race and gender groups
were no longer experiencing double digit declines in
homicide rates. The rates for older black males and
older teen and young adult black females increased
slightly. The offending rates displayed similar
patterns. 

Infanticide
The number of infanticides (victims under age 5) has
grown roughly in proportion to the number of young
children in the population, with most perpetrators
being a parent.

Graph:  Most children under age 5 who are victims
of homicide are killed by a parent

Homicides of children under age 5 by relationship 
with the offender, 1976-2000

Line chart with five lines: parent, friend or 
acquaintance, unknown, other family, and stranger.

The percent of infanticides committed by a parent 
begins at 57% in 1976 and decreases to 47% in 1979. 
Then it increases to 59% in 1983, drops to 52% in 1984, 
and increases to 62% in 1985. From 1986 to 1992 it 
fluctuates between 52% and 58%, reaching a
low of 50% in 1993. After 1993 it increases to 57% 
in 1999, and decreases to 52% in 2000.

The percent of infanticides committed by a friend or 
acquaintance begins at 20% in 1976 and increases to 
28% in 1993. After 1993
it decreases to 26% in 2000.

The percent of infanticides where the relationship 
of the offender to the victim was unknown begins at 
12% in 1976 and increases to 17% in 1979. It decreases 
to 8% in 1985 and then increases to 16% in 1990. 
After 1990 it decreases to 13% in 2000.

The percent of infanticides committed by another family 
member begins at 8% in 1976 and mildly fluctuates between 
4% and 9% through 2000, where it was 8%.

The percent of infanticides committed by a stranger 
begins at 3% in 1976 and decreases to 1% in 2000.

Eldercide
The number of homicides of persons age 65 and
over has been decreasing. Yet among all age
groups, the elderly have the highest percentage of
homicides that occur during the commission of a
felony.

Intimate homicide
There has been a decline in homicide of intimates,
especially male victims. The number of white females
killed by intimates rose in the mid-1980's and
declined after 1993. Since 1998 the number of white
women killed by intimates has increased but has not
reached earlier levels. The number of intimate
homicides for all other race and gender groups
declined over the period; black males killed by
intimates dropped 77%, white males by 54%, and
black females by 53%. 

Graph:  Except for white females, the number of
intimate victims (husbands, wives, boyfriends, and
girlfriends) in each race and gender group has fallen
dramatically

Homicides of intimates by gender and race of 
victim, 1976-2000

Line chart with four lines: white female, black female,
white male, and black male.

For white females, the number of victims begins at 849 
in 1976 and rises slightly to reach 1,005 in 1985. 
After 1988 it decreases to 851 in 2000.

For black females, the number of victims begins at 
714 in 1976 and decreases gradually to 467 in 1984. 
After 1984 it increases to 542 in 1993. After 
1993 it decreases to 333 in 2000.

For white males, the number of victims begins at 
493 in 1976, increases to 554 in 1981, and then 
decreases to 229 in 2000. 

For black males, the number of victims begins at 846 
in 1976 and decreases to its lowest point of 192 in 2000.

Law enforcement officers killed
From 1976 to 2000, the number of law enforcement
officers killed in the line of duty declined, mostly
because of the decline in law enforcement officers
killed with handguns.

Multiple victims and offenders
Few homicides involve multiple offenders, and fewer
involve multiple victims. The percentage of homicides
involving multiple offenders increased dramatically in
the late 1980's and early 1990's, from 10% in 1976 to
almost 18% in 2000. The percentage of homicides
involving multiple victims increased gradually during
the last two decades from just under 3% of all
homicides in 1976 to 4% in 2000. 

Circumstances
The mix of circumstances surrounding homicides has
changed over the last two decades. Although the
number of homicides resulting from arguments has
declined, arguments remain the most frequently cited
circumstance.

City size
The homicide victimization rates in cities with a
population of 1 million or more have declined to the
lowest level during the study period. In the late
1990's, the rates of homicide for cities in all 
groups of 250,000 or more population were about the 
same. Most of the swings in the prevalence of homicide
during the past two decades occurred in cities with a
population of 100,000 or more and in suburbs. Small
cities and rural areas experienced relatively little
change in homicide prevalence. 

Graph: Until recently, changes in homicide rates for 
large American cities varied by size

Homicide victimization rates, by city size, 1976-2000

Line chart with four lines by city population of: 
1 million +; 500,000 to 999,999; 250,000 to 499,999; 
and 100,000 to 249,999.

For cities with populations of 1 million and above, 
the homicide rate in 1976 starts at 20.9 per 100,000 
and increases to 30.9 per 100,000 in 1980. After 1980 
it decreases, reaching 22.9 per 100,000 in 1987, and 
then increases to a high point of 35.5 per 100,000
in 1991. It then decreases, reaching 14.7 per 100,000 in 2000.

For cities with populations of 500,000 to 999,999, 
the homicide rate in 1976 starts at 19.5 per 100,000, 
drops to 18.1 per 100,000 in 1977, and increases to 
22.2 per 100,000 in 1981. After 1981 it decreases to 
17.2 per 100,000 in 1983 and then increases, reaching
24.6 per 100,000 in 1990. It then decreases to 15.7 
per 100,000 in 1996, before increasing, reaching 14.9 
in 2000.

For cities with populations of 250,000 to 499,999,
the homicide rate in 1976 starts at 16.5 per 100,000 
and increases to 22.1 per 100,000 in 1980. It then 
decreases to 16.1 per 100,000 in 1984 and then spikes 
to 19.8 per 100,000 in 1986. In 1987 it sharply drops
to 16.3 per 100,000 and then increases, reaching 25.1 
per 100,000 in 1993. After 1993 it decreases, reaching 
14.0 per 100,000 in 2000.

For cities with populations of 100,000 to 249,999, 
the homicide rate in 1976 starts at 11.3 per 100,000 
and increases, reaching 14.3 per 100,000 in 1981. 
It sharply decreases to 10.7 per 100,000 in 1983 
before increasing to 14.9 per 100,000 in 1991. 
In 1992 it sharply decreases to 13.2 per 100,000 and 
then increases, reaching 15.0 per 100,000 in 1994. 
After that, it decreases, reaching 9.5
per 100,000 in 2000.

Region
Compared to the national average, homicide rates,
especially those involving guns, were higher in the
South and lower in New England, the Mountain
region, and the West North Central region of the
United States.

Clearances
The number of homicides cleared by arrest of the
perpetrator declined until recently: 63% of all
homicides were cleared in 2000 compared to 79% in
1976.
