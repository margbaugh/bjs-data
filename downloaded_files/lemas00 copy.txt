Highlights

Based on the 2000 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative 
Statistics survey, this volume describes more than 800 State and 
local law enforcement agencies with 100 or more full-time sworn
personnel. Topics covered include personnel, expenditures and 
pay, operations, community policing, policies and programs,
equipment, and computerization. 

Included among these larger law enforcement agencies are 501
municipal police departments, 222 sheriffs' offices, 32 county
police departments, and the 49 primary State law enforcement
agencies. Collectively, these agencies employed approximately  
402,000 full-time sworn personnel, including 241,000 uniformed 
officers assigned to respond to calls for service.

Personnel

On average, larger municipal police departments employed 22
full-time sworn personnel per 10,000 residents. County police
departments and sheriffs' offices employed an average of 11 
and 10 officers per 10,000 residents, respectively. State law
enforcement agencies employed an average of 2 officers per
10,000 residents. 

From 1996 to 2000 the median percentage increase in number
of full-time sworn personnel was higher in county police
departments (11%) and sheriffs' offices (10%) than in municipal
police (5%) or State agencies (5%). Sheriffs' offices had an
18% median increase in civilian personnel, compared to 7% for
municipal and county police, and 10% for State law enforcement
agencies. 

Seventy-two percent of the sworn personnel in State law
enforcement agencies were uniformed officers assigned to
respond to calls for service, compared to 61% in county and
municipal police departments, and 47% in sheriffs' offices. 
The latter had more officers handling duties related to jail 
operations (19%), court security (8%), and process serving 
(4%) duties. 

Fourteen percent of the officers in larger municipal police
departments and sheriffs' offices were women, as were 12% of
county police officers. Women accounted for 6% of the officers
in State agencies. From 1990 to 2000, the average percentage of
female officers increased for each type  of agency except
sheriffs' offices.

In 2000, 32% of the officers in larger municipal police
departments were members of a racial or ethnic minority,
compared to 23% in county police departments, 22% in
sheriffs' offices, and 16% in State agencies. For each
agency type, the average minority percentage was higher 
in 2000 than 1990. 

Nearly all larger law enforcement agencies used background 
investigations, criminal record checks, driving record checks, 
medical exams, and personal interviews to screen officer 
recruits. State agencies (94%) and county police departments 
(90%) were more likely to use credit history checks than 
municipal police (79%) or sheriffs' offices (73%). County police 
(97%) were the most likely to use drug tests and State agencies 
(76%) the least likely. State agencies were the most likely to 
use written aptitude (92%) and physical agility (90%) tests and 
sheriffs' offices (65% and 59%) the least likely.  

About 1 in 3 State agencies had a college requirement for new
officers, with 12% requiring a 2-year degree and 2%, a 4-year
degree. About 1 in 4 municipal and county police departments
had a college requirement, with about 1 in 10 requiring a degree.
In 6% of county police departments and 2% of municipal police 
departments, a 4-year degree was required. About 1 in 7 sheriffs' 
offices had a college requirement, including 6% that required a 
2-year degree. Overall, larger law enforcement agencies were
about twice as likely to have a college requirement in 2000 as
in 1990.

The median number of academy training hours required for new
officers was higher in State law enforcement agencies (960) and
county police departments (896), than in municipal police
departments (720) or sheriffs' offices (640). The median number 
of field training hours required was slightly higher in
municipal police departments (520) than for other agency types 
(480). 

Budget and pay

Sheriff's offices and State agencies had annual operating budgets 
of about $108,000 per officer, compared to $90,237 for county 
police and $83,638 for municipal police. From 1990 to 2000, 
inflation-adjusted operating costs per officer rose 38% for State 
agencies, 30% for sheriffs' offices, 27% for county police, and 
21% for municipal police.

In 2000 median annual per resident operating costs were $173 for
municipal police, $112 for county police, $85 for sheriffs' 
offices, and $25 for State agencies. Compared to 1990, inflation-
adjusted operating costs per resident were up 25% for municipal
police, 120% for county police, 30% for sheriffs' offices, and
25% for State agencies. 

In 2000 average starting salaries for entry-level officers
ranged from $33,233 in municipal police departments to
$29,280 in sheriffs' offices. Compared to 1990, inflation-
adjusted starting salaries were up 5% in State agencies, 
municipal police departments, and sheriffs' offices, but 
unchanged in county police departments. 

In 2000 nearly three-fourths of municipal police departments
(72%) authorized collective bargaining for officers compared
to about half of county police departments (52%) and State
agencies (51%). Sheriffs' offices (42%) were less likely to 
allow     collective bargaining for officers.

About two-thirds of municipal police departments (68%) and
about half of sheriffs' offices (51%) offered education
incentive pay to officers. State agencies (27%) and county
police departments (20%) were less likely to offer it. A 
majority of each type of agency had a tuition reimbursement 
program for officers:  municipal police (73%), county police 
(70%), State agencies (65%), and sheriffs' offices (59%). 

Operations 

In 2000, 35% of larger sheriffs' offices were using foot patrol 
on a routine basis compared to 5% in 1993, and 57% were using
bicycle patrols, up from 9% in 1993. Similar increases were
observed for county police (31% to 58% for foot patrol, 38% to
84% for bicycle patrol), and municipal police (47% to 74% for 
foot patrol, 40% to 92% for bicycle patrol). Among State law
enforcement agencies, 29% were using bike patrol and 18% were 
using foot patrol in 2000, compared to 0% for both in 1993. 

In 2000 nearly all larger local law enforcement agencies (93%) 
participated in an enhanced 9-1-1 emergency telephone system 
where the location of callers could be identified automatically. 
In 1990, 57% of these agencies were part of such a system. Among
State agencies, about half participated in an enhanced 9-1-1 
system in 2000 compared to about a third in 1990.

Ninety-one percent of sheriffs' offices performed search and
rescue operations during 2000, as did 77% of county police
departments and 71% of State agencies. Municipal police
(43%) were less likely to handle this function.

County police (97%) were the most likely to perform special
weapons and tactics (SWAT)operations; however most municipal 
police departments (89%), sheriffs' offices (88%), and state 
agencies (84%) did so as well.

State law enforcement agencies (91%) and county police
departments (82%) were more likely to operate a training
academy than sheriffs' offices (52%) or municipal police
departments (41%).

A majority of county police (89%), municipal police (79%), and 
sheriffs' offices (69%) had a full-time drug enforcement unit.
Thirty-seven percent of State agencies had one. About 4 in 5
local agencies had officers assigned full-time to a multi-agency 
drug task force, compared to about 1 in 5 State agencies. 

Nearly all larger sheriffs' offices handled court-related 
functions such as court security (98%)and process serving (98%).
Less than a third of other agency types performed these
functions. 

Ninety-one percent of sheriffs' offices operated a jail, compared 
to 34% of municipal police departments and 13% of county 
police departments. No State agencies were responsible for 
this function. 

Community policing

In 2000 a majority of larger county (69%) and municipal (59%) 
police departments had a written community policing plan.
Less than half of sheriffs' offices (43%) and State agencies 
(35%)had one. For each agency type, the percentage with a 
written plan was about the same as in 1997. 
 
About two-thirds of larger municipal (68%) and county (66%) 
police departments had a full-time community policing unit.
A majority of sheriffs' offices (57%) also had such a unit, 
but just a fourth of State agencies did. These percentages 
were also similar to 1997.

In 2000 nearly all municipal (95%) and county (94%) police
departments had  sworn personnel designated as full-time 
community policing officers compared to about 4 in 5 
agencies in 1997. Eighty-eight percent of sheriffs' offices 
had community policing officers in 2000 compared to 66% in 
1997. About twice as many State agencies had full-time
community policing officers in 2000 (53%) as in 1997 (27%). 

More than three-fourths of municipal (79%) and county (76%) 
police departments trained all new officer recruits in
community policing methods during 2000, about the same
proportion as in 1997. From 1997 to 2000, the percentage of
sheriffs' offices providing such training increased from 49% 
to 61%, and State law enforcement agencies, from 41% to 47%.  

From 1997 to 2000 the percentage of larger local law
enforcement agencies that encouraged patrol officers to
engage in problem-solving projects increased slightly, from
55% to 58%.  Among State agencies the increase was from
22% to 31%. In both survey years, about 1 in 3 local
agencies and 1 in 5 State agencies included problem-solving 
projects in the criteria used for evaluating the performance 
of patrol officers. 
  
In the 12-month period ending June 30, 2000, 72% of municipal 
police departments conducted a citizen police academy, as did 
52% of county police departments, 47% of sheriffs' offices, and 
18% of State agencies. 

Nearly 2 in 3 local agencies upgraded technology to support
their community policing efforts during this period, including
71% of municipal police departments. About 2 in 5 State
agencies upgraded technology for this purpose.

During the year ending June 30, 2000, most larger local law
enforcement agencies met regularly with neighborhood
associations (89%), school groups (79%), business groups
(69%), domestic violence groups (64%), other local public
agencies (62%), senior citizen groups (59%), advocacy groups
(54%), and youth service organizations (54%). A majority
of State agencies met regularly with school groups (65%) and
local public agencies (57%).  

About half of larger local agencies surveyed citizens on
their satisfaction with services, and two-fifths conducted a
survey of citizen perceptions of crime-related problems. About 
a fourth conducted surveys of personal crime experiences or
crime reporting. About a third of State agencies surveyed
citizens about their satisfaction with agency services. 
Less than a fifth conducted surveys on the other topics. 

Evaluating program effectiveness was the most common use 
of survey data for both local (44%) and State (31%) 
agencies. Thirty-seven percent of local agencies used
survey data as a source of information for patrol officers. 

Policies and programs

Larger local law enforcement agencies operated a variety of
full-time special units to address youth and family problems. 
For example about 3 in 4 county police departments (79%),
sheriffs' offices (76%), and municipal police departments
(71%) had a special unit for drug education in schools.   

A majority of county police departments had full-time units
for child abuse (62%), juvenile crime (62%), and gangs (55%).
About half had units for youth outreach (50%), domestic
violence (48%), and missing children (48%). 

Nearly half of municipal police departments had full-time 
units for domestic violence (48%), gangs (48%), and child 
abuse (46%).  More than two-fifths of sheriffs' offices had 
units for child abuse (48%), juvenile crime (46%), domestic 
violence (42%), and gangs (41%). Among State agencies, the
most common types of units were those for drug education in
schools (39%) and missing children (31%).

A majority of larger local agencies also had units for
internal affairs (79%), community crime prevention
(70%), crime analysis (61%), and research and planning
(54%). Most State agencies had internal affairs (84%), and
research and planning (76%)units. About half had crime
analysis units (47%).

Nearly all larger law enforcement agencies had written policies 
pertaining to deadly force, conduct and appearance, nonlethal 
force, and off-duty employment. About 7 in 10  had a policy on 
the maximum number of work hours allowed for officers. 

Local agencies were about 4 times as likely to have a
restrictive type (73%) of pursuit driving policy (one based on
specific criteria such as offense type or maximum speed) as a
judgmental type (19%)(one that leaves pursuits up to the
officer's discretion). State agencies were nearly as likely to
have a judgmental pursuit policy (45%) as a restrictive one
(51%).

Equipment

As of June 2000, State law enforcement agencies operated 103 cars 
per 100 officers, compared to 98 cars per 100 officers in 1990. 
Local agencies also increased their car-to-officer ratio during 
this period:  County police went from 71 to 79 cars per 100 
officers, municipal police from 47 to 59, and sheriffs' offices 
from 55 to 68. 

In 2000, 98% of larger local law enforcement agencies and all 49
primary State law enforcement agencies authorized semiautomatic 
sidearms for officers. In 1990, 85% of local agencies and 80% 
of State agencies authorized semiautomatics. 

From 1990 to 2000 the percentage of larger local law enforcement 
agencies requiring all regular field/patrol officers to wear 
body armor increased from 21% to 50%. The percentage of State 
law enforcement agencies requiring that armor be worn increased 
from 12% in 1990 to 37% in 2000.

Nearly all larger local law enforcement agencies authorized the 
use of batons (97%) and pepper spray (91%)in 2000. In 1990, 77% 
of local agencies authorized the use of impact devices and 71% 
the use of chemical agents. Among State agencies, nearly all 
authorized batons (98%) and pepper spray (96%) in 2000. In 1990, 
65% allowed impact devices and 61%, chemical agents.

Nearly all (94%) State agencies used video cameras in at least
some patrol cars in 2000. Among local agencies more than half 
of sheriffs' offices (54%) and about two-fifths of county (42%) 
and municipal (39%) police departments used in-car video 
cameras. 

A majority of State law enforcement agencies (58%)and county 
police departments (55%) used infrared (thermal) imaging equipment 
in 2000. Forty-seven percent of sheriffs' offices and 38% of 
municipal police departments used this type of equipment.

Nearly all (94%) State law enforcement agencies used tire
deflation spikes in 2000, as did about two-thirds of sheriffs'
offices (66%). About half of county (52%) and municipal (47%) 
police departments used such devices.

Computers and information systems 

In about four-fifths of larger State and local law enforcement
agencies, patrol officers were using in-field computers or
terminals during 2000. From 1990 to 2000, the percentage of
State agencies using car-mounted computers or terminals rose 
from 14% to    59%, and among local agencies, from 19% to 68%. 

Officers had direct access via in-field computer to vehicle and
driving records in more than three-fifths of local agencies in
2000, compared to about half in 1997. Access to this information
was available in 53% of State agencies in 2000, compared to
37% in 1997.
 
About 3 in 8 State and local agencies provided at least some
officers with in-field access to criminal history information
during 2000, compared to about 3 in 10 agencies in 1997. In
2000, 45% of local agencies provided officers with in-field
access to calls for service information compared to 27% in
1997. In State agencies, the percentage rose  only slightly -
from 12% to 14%.

In 2000, 78% of State and local agencies used paper forms to
submit criminal incident reports to the agency's central
information system, compared to 86% of local agencies and
90% of State agencies in 1997. The decline in the use of 
paper reports was accompanied by increases in the use of
computer media, data downloads, telephone lines, and wireless 
transmissions. 

From 1990 to 2000 the percentage of larger local law 
enforcement agencies with exclusive or shared ownership 
of an Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS)
increased from 29% to 42%. For State agencies the increase 
was from 27% to 61%.

Seventy-four percent of local agencies were using digital
imaging for mug shots in 2000 compared to 51% in 1997.
Similar increases were seen in the use of digital imaging 
for fingerprints (44% to 65%) and suspect composites (34% 
to 52%). Among State agencies, 35% were using digital 
imaging for fingerprints in both 2000 and 1997. During this 
period, their use of digital imaging for mug shots rose from 
14% to 29% of agencies, and for suspect composites, from 14% 
to 20%.

During 2000 most larger law enforcement agencies used
computers for Internet access (87%), records management
(86%), dispatch (85%), crime analysis (80%), crime
investigations (75%), personnel records (71%), crime mapping
(63%), automated booking (56%), interagency information
sharing (55%), and fleet management (52%). 

A majority of State agencies used computers for Internet
access (96%), personnel records (92%), records management 
(86%), fleet management (74%), in-field report writing (71%), 
interagency information sharing (71%), crime analysis (63%), 
crime investigations (59%), dispatch (59%), and resource 
allocation (57%).

In 2000 about 9 in 10 local agencies had computerized files
on arrests (91%), calls for service (90%), and incident
reports (88%). More than 7 in 10 had computer files on stolen
property (77%), traffic accidents (75%), alarms (74%), traffic
citations (71%), and warrants (71%). More than half had
computer files on criminal histories (63%) and traffic stops
(51%).

Among State agencies, about 3 in 4 had computerized files on
traffic accidents (76%) and traffic citations (74%). A majority
had files on arrests (63%), incident reports (63%), calls for
service (59%), fingerprints (55%), and criminal histories (51%).

Foreward

----------------------------------------------
The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) began the Law Enforcement 
Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) program in 1987 
with a nationwide survey of State and local law enforcement
agencies. Updated versions of the LEMAS survey were completed in 
1990, 1993, 1997 and 1999. The current volume presents 2000 data
provided by 755 local and 49 State law enforcement agencies
employing 100 or more full-time sworn personnel.  Sections on
personnel, expenditures and pay, operations, community policing,
policies and programs, equipment, and computers and information 
systems are included.  

As in 1997 and 1999, the community policing section is based on 
survey questions developed by the Office of Community Oriented 
Policing Services (COPS). An outgrowth of the ongoing 
partnership between BJS and COPS, the 2000 LEMAS survey is 
expected to be instrumental in assessing the state of law 
enforcement in the United States. COPS and BJS jointly funded 
the administration of the survey.  

The inclusion of community policing questions in the 1997,
1999 and 2000 LEMAS surveys is but one step in assessing the
potential impact community policing programs have had on
law enforcement agencies across the country. The data also enable 
us to observe how law enforcement agencies are changing in other
areas such as officer characteristics, training and education 
requirements, and technological capabilities.    

We are pleased to present the results of the 2000 LEMAS survey 
and are confident that the information gleaned from these data 
will help further our knowledge of law enforcement as it exists 
today. We believe the results of the survey will provide law 
enforcement agencies an opportunity to assess their progress 
relative to that of comparable jurisdictions. In closing, we 
gratefully acknowledge the participating agencies that have 
given us a glimpse into their law enforcement practices and 
hope that this information will be of use not just to them, but 
to the communities they serve as well.

Introduction

The 2000 Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) survey included all State and local
agencies employing 100 or more full-time sworn personnel
as reported in a BJS census of State and local law enforcement
agencies conducted in 1996. The survey also included a
nationally representative sample of agencies that employed 
fewer than 100 officers. These smaller agencies are covered 
in separate BJS reports.

The 2000 LEMAS questionnaire was mailed to the same agencies 
that received the 1997 version. The initial mailing of the
2000 form was conducted in July 2000. The reference date
for all personnel-related questions was the pay period that 
included June 30, 2000. For other questions it was June 30,
2000, unless otherwise indicated. The data were collected by 
the U.S. Census Bureau for BJS.

A total of 3,065 State and local law enforcement agencies
received the 2000 LEMAS questionnaire, and 2,985 (97.8%) 
responded. Of the 881 agencies with 100 or more officers 
that received the survey, 866 (98.3%) responded. This was 
the fifth regular survey in the LEMAS program with
previous data collections occurring in 1987, 1990, 1993,
and 1997. A special administration that focused on
community policing and related topics was conducted in 1999.

Overview of this volume

This volume presents individual agency data for 804 larger 
State and local law enforcement agencies. Agencies with special
geographic jurisdictions such as university campuses, public
school districts, transportation systems, parks and recreation
facilities, airports, waterways, public housing, or State
government buildings are excluded. Agencies with special
enforcement responsibilities such as natural resource and
conservation laws, alcohol control laws, or agricultural 
laws are also excluded. 

The volume includes the 49 primary State law enforcement
agencies operating in each State except Hawaii. (The
Hawaii Department of Public Safety primarily performs
court-related duties.)

General purpose local law enforcement agencies that responded 
to the LEMAS survey are included as long as they met the 
following criteria: 

   1. Employment of 100 or more full-time sworn officers as
of June 2000. 

   2. Employment of 35 or more full-time uniformed sworn
officers with regular assigned duties that included responding
to calls for service as of June 2000.

A total of 755 local law enforcement agencies are included. 
This includes 32 county police departments, 501 municipal 
police departments, and 222 sheriffs' offices. Local agencies 
from every State except North Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming are 
included.  These States had no local agencies that met the above
requirements for inclusion.

Because they did not complete the 2000 LEMAS survey form, the 
following agencies do not have data presented in many of the 
tables: (AZ) Sheriff, Costa Mesa (CA) Police, Clayton County 
(GA) Police, Cook County (IL) Sheriff, Medford (MA) Police, 
Revere (MA)Police, St. Charles (MO) Police, Edison (NJ) Police, 
and Paterson (NJ) Police. 

Organization of data tables 

A summary of the number and type of agencies from each State 
is in table A.

Table B lists the local law enforcement agencies employing 1,000 
or more full-time sworn personnel that included 500 or more 
uniformed officers whose regular assigned duties included 
responding to calls for service. These are the agencies with the 
largest number of sworn personnel providing direct law enforcement
services.

Table C presents summary data, by type of agency, for the
variables that are included in the individual agency tables that
follow. The reader should refer to the notes in the corresponding 
individual data agency tables when using data from table C.

Following the 3 summary data tables are tables containing
individual data for State and local law enforcement agencies
with 100 or more officers. The 19 tables for local agencies are
presented first as tables 1a through 19a. Following the local
agency tables are tables 1b through 19b covering the State
agencies. 

Local agencies are listed alphabetically by State and county. 
Within each county, the county sheriffs' department or
county police department is listed first, if applicable.  
These are followed, in alphabetical order, by the municipal 
police agencies operating within that county. 

The reader should refer to the note following each table for the
explanation of symbols and codes as well as other important
information. A triple dash ("---")is used in all tables to 
indicate that a particular data item was not provided by an 
agency.
