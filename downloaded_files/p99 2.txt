*In 1999, 6 States expanded their reporting criteria.  
For comparisons with previous years, the count 1,209,123 
should be used.

*  During 1999 the number of female prisoners rose by 4.4%,
greater than the increase in male prisoners (3.3%).  At yearend
1999, 90,668 women were in State or Federal prisons -- 6.6% of
all prison inmates.

*  On December 31, 1999, State prisons were operating between 1%
and 17% above capacity, while Federal prisons were operating at
32% above capacity.

*  Texas (163,190), California (163,067), and the Federal system
(135,246) together held 1 in every 3 prisoners in the Nation. 
Thirteen States, each holding fewer than 5,000 inmates, together
held less than 3% of the Nation=s prisoners.

*  Two States -- Idaho (up 12.9%) and Wisconsin (10.9%) -- had
increases of at least 10% in 1999.  Nine jurisdictions
experienced decreases, led by Rhode Island (down 12.8%) and the
District of Columbia (-12.0%).

*  At yearend 1999, privately operated facilities housed 71,208
inmates (5.2% of  State and Federal inmates); local jails housed
63,635 State inmates (5.2% of State prisoners). 

*  Factors underlying the growth in the State prison population
between 1990 and 1998 included --

-- a 54% rise in the number of parole violators returned to
prison and a 7% increase in new court commitments. 
-- a drop in annual release rates from 37% in 1990 to 31% in
1998.
-- an increase in the average time served in prison by released
inmates (from 22 months in 1990 to 28 months in 1998) and in the
time expected to be served by those entering prison (from 38
months to 43 months).
-- an increase in violent offenders (representing 51% of State
growth) and drug offenders (19% of State growth). 

*  Analyses of imprisonment rates from 1990 to 1999 reveal --
-- a 60% increase among males and an 84% increase among females
in the number of sentenced prisoners per 100,000 residents.
-- large disparities by race and Hispanic origin.  In 1999 the
rate among black males in their late twenties reached  9,392
prisoners per 100,000 residents compared to 3,126 among Hispanic
males and 990 among white males

The total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of Federal
or State  adult correctional authorities was 1,366,721 at
yearend 1999.  During the year the States and the District of
Columbia added 31,591 prisoners, and the Federal prison system
added 12,205 prisoners.  Overall, the Nation=s prison population
grew 3.4%, which was less than the average annual growth of 
6.5% since 1990.  During 1999 the prison population rose at the
lowest rate since 1979 and had the smallest absolute increase
since 1988. 

The rate of incarceration in prison at yearend 1999 was 476
sentenced inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents -- up from 292 in
1990.  About 1 in every 110 men and 1 in every 1,695 women were
sentenced prisoners under the jurisdiction of State or Federal
authorities.

Overall, the United States incarcerated 2,026,596 persons at
yearend 1999.  This total represents persons held in -- 

-- Federal and State prisons    
   (1,284,894, which excludes State
   prisoners in local jails)
-- territorial prisons (18,394)
-- local jails (605,943)
-- facilities operated by or exclusively
   for the U.S. Immigration and 
   Naturalization Service (7,675)
-- military facilities (2,279) 
-- jails in Indian country (1,621)
-- juvenile facilities (105,790, as of
   October 29, 1997). 

About 1 in every 137 residents in the United States and its
Territories were incarcerated. 

Nearly 1.9 million were in prisons 
and local jails; 135,800 held in other 
facilities

On December 31, 1999, 1,284,894 inmates were in the custody of
State and Federal prison authorities, and 605,943 were in the
custody of local jails authorities.  During 1999 the number of
inmates in State prisons increased by 2.1%; in Federal prisons,
13.4%; and in local jails, 2.3%.  Since 1990 the incarcerated
population has grown on average 5.7% annually.

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail in 1999 was 690
inmates per 100,000 residents -- up from 458 per 100,000 in 1990.

At yearend 1999 other correctional authorities also held
inmates.  The U.S. Territories and Commonwealths -- American
Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and Virgin
Islands -- reported 18,394 inmates under the jurisdiction of
their prison systems at yearend 1999 -- an increase of 3.2%
since 1998.  Puerto Rico, the largest of the Territories, had
the most prisoners (15,465 at yearend 1999), down 6.4% since
1998.

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) reported
17,986 detainees on December 31, 1999, up 4.6% from 1998. 
Though many of these detainees (10,311) were held in Federal and
State prisons and local jails,  7,675  were held in INS-operated
facilities or other confinement facilities.

U.S. military authorities held 2,279 prisoners in 65 facilities
at yearend 1999, down 6.1% since 1998.  Army facilities held 45%
of all inmates under military jurisdiction; Navy faciliites,
30%; Marine Corps, 21%; and Air Force, 4%. 

Other correctional authorities include 69 Indian country jails
and detention centers, which held 1,621 inmates on June 30,
1999.  In addition, 105,790 juveniles were held in 1,121 public
and 2,310 private residential placement facilities on October
29, 1997 (when the last count was completed).  Overall, the U.S.
incarcerated 2,026,596 persons at yearend 1999 -- the equivalent
of 1 in every 137 residents in the U.S. and its Territories.

U.S. prison population rose 3.4% 
during 1999 -- the smallest annual 
growth rate since 1979

The 1999 growth in the number of inmates under State or Federal
jurisdiction (3.4%) was slightly smaller than the percentage
increase recorded during 1998 (4.7%).  The population under the
jurisdiction of State and Federal authorities increased by
43,796 inmates during 1999, significantly lower than in 1998 (up
58,420).  Since yearend 1990 the prison population has grown an
average of 65,867 per year, for an increase of 592,802 in 9
years.

Prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year ("sentenced prisoners")
represented 96% of the total prison population at yearend 1999.  
During the 12-month period, the sentenced prison
population grew 3.2%.  The remaining prisoners had sentences of
a year or less or were currently unsentenced (that is, awaiting
trial in States with combined prison-jail systems).

The sentenced Federal prison population (up 10.2%) grew at over
4 times the rate of the sentenced State prison population during
1999 (up 2.5%).  The sentenced Federal population grew faster
than in 1998 (9.2%), while growth in the sentenced State
population was down from 1998 (3.9%). 

Prison incarceration rates have risen sharply 
since 1990

On December 31, 1999, the number of sentenced prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents was 476.  Of the 12 States with rates
greater than that for the Nation, 8 were in the South, 3 were in
the West, and 1 was in the Midwest.  Three States -- Minnesota
(125), Maine (133), and North Dakota (137) -- had rates that
were less than a third of the national rate.  The District of
Columbia, a wholly urban jurisdiction, held 1,314 sentenced
prisoners per 100,000 residents.

Since 1990 the number of sentenced prisoners per 100,000
residents has risen from 292 to 476.  During this period,
incarceration rates rose most in the South (from 316 to 543) and
West (from 277 to 421).  The rate in the Midwest rose from 239
to 367, and the rate in the Northeast grew from 232 to 330.  The
number of sentenced Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S.
residents increased from 20 to 42.

Two States reported increases of at least 10% 
during 1999; 8 States reported decreases

Between January 1 and December 31, Idaho experienced the largest
increase (up 12.9%), followed by Wisconsin (10.9%), Colorado
(9.5%), Mississippi (9.4%), Oregon (9.2%),  and Wyoming (9.0%). 
Eight States and the District of Columbia experienced a decline
in prison populations.  Rhode Island had the largest decline
(down 12.8%), followed by the District of Columbia (down 12.0%),
Massachusetts (down 3.8%), and Alaska (down 3.6%).

In absolute numbers of inmates, 6 jurisdictions grew by at least
2,000.  The Federal system (up 12,205 inmates), experienced the
largest growth, followed by Georgia (up 2,829), Texas (up
2,727), Florida (up 2,372), Virginia (up 2,177), and Wisconsin
(up 2,014).  These six jurisdictions incarcerated 29% of all
prisoners but accounted for nearly 56% of the total growth
during 1999.

Since 1990 the sentenced inmate population in State prisons has
grown 71%.  During this period nine States more than doubled
their sentenced inmate populations, led by Texas (up 173%),
Idaho (up 147%), and West Virginia (up 126%).  Between 1990 and
1999 the Federal system reported an increase of 127% -- 63,872
additional inmates with sentences of more than 1 year. 

Among States, Louisiana had 
the highest incarceration rate;
Minnesota, the lowest

At yearend 1999 the 10 jurisdictions with the largest prison
populations had under their jurisdiction 821,067 inmates, or 60%
of the Nation's total prison population.  Texas (163,190),
California (163,067), and the Federal system (135,246) accounted
for a third of the population.  The 10 States with the smallest
prison populations each held fewer than 4,000 inmates. 
Collectively, these States held only 1.7% of the Nation=s total
prison population.

Louisiana had the highest prison incarceration rate (776
sentenced inmates per 100,000 residents), followed by Texas
(762), Oklahoma (662), and Mississippi (626).  Seven States had
prison incarceration rates below 200, led by Minnesota (125),
Maine (133), and North Dakota (137).

Since 1990 two States had average annual prison population
increases of at least 10%:  Texas (11.8%) and Idaho (10.6%). 
Eight States had average annual growth rates of less than 4%,
led by Maine (1.3%), Rhode Island (2.1%), and Alaska (2.6%).

Female prisoner population more 
than doubled since 1990

During 1999 the number of women under the jurisdiction of State
or Federal prison authorities increased 4.4%, outpacing the rise
in the number of men (up 3.3%) for the fourth consecutive year. 
At yearend 90,688 women and 1,276,053 men were in State or
Federal prisons.

Since 1990 the annual rate of growth of the female inmate
population has averaged 8.3%, higher than the 6.4% average
increase in the number of male inmates.  While the total number
of male prisoners has grown 75% since 1990, the number of female
prisoners has increased 106%.  By yearend 1999 women accounted
for 6.6% of all prisoners nationwide, up from 5.7% in 1990. 

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident population, men
were 15 times more likely than women to be incarcerated in a
State or Federal prison.  At yearend 1999 there were 59
sentenced female inmates per 100,000 women in the United States,
compared to 913 sentenced male inmates per 100,000 men.

Over a third of all female prisoners were held in the 3 largest
jurisdictions:  Texas (12,502), California (11,368), and the
Federal system (9,913).  Oklahoma (with 134 sentenced female
inmates per 100,000 female State residents) and Texas and
Lousiana (both with 100) had the highest female incarceration
rates.  Maine (with 9 sentenced female prisoners per 100,000
female residents) and Rhode Island (11) had the lowest
incarceration rates.

Since 1990 the female prisoner population has grown at an annual
average rate of at least 10% in 18 States.  Tennessee reported
the highest average annual increase in female prisoners (15.0%),
followed by North Dakota (14.9%), Montana (14.7%), and Idaho
(14.3%).  The District of Columbia, which is transferring
jurisdiction of its prison inmates to the Federal system, was
the only jurisdiction to report fewer female prisoners since
1990.  In 1999, the District of Columbia recorded a 23% decline
in the number of female inmates.

Privately-operated prisons held over 71,000 
State and Federal inmates in 1999

At yearend 1999, 31 States, the District of Columbia, and the
Federal system reported a total of 71,208 prisoners held in
privately operated facilities.  These private facilities held
5.5% of all State prisoners and 2.8% of Federal prisoners.

Texas (with 11,653 State inmates housed in private facilities)
and Oklahoma (with 6,228) reported the largest number in 1999. 
Five States -- New Mexico (39%),  Alaska (35%), Oklahoma (28%),
Montana (25%), Hawaii (24%) -- had at least 20% of their prison
population housed in private facilities.

Except  for Wisconsin (with 17% of its State inmates in private
facilities) and New Jersey (with 8%), the use of private
facilities was concentrated among Southern and Western States. 
Overall, 8.1% of State inmates in the South and 5.8% in the West
were in privately operated facilities at the end of 1999.

Local jails held nearly 64,000 State
prisoners 

At the end of 1999, 34 States reported a total of  63,635 State
prisoners held in local jails or other facilities operated by
county or local authorities.  These inmates held in local jails
represented 5.2% of all State prisoners in 1999.

Louisiana had the largest percentage of its State inmate
population housed in local jails, 44%.  Three other States --
Montana (28%), Tennessee (25%), and Kentucky (21%) -- had at
least  20% of their population housed in local jail facilities.

In addition to housing inmates in privately-operated facilities
and local jails (within their own State and elsewhere), 35
States reported placing inmates in Federal facilities and in
other State-operated facilities.  On December 31, 1999, 6,952
prisoners nationwide were held under such arrangements --
representing less than 1% of all State prisoners.  Michigan
placed the most inmates (774), followed by California (640) and
Wisconsin (562).  Vermont (26%) and the District of Columbia
(15%) had more than 10% of their prison population housed in
facilities of other States or the Federal system.

Prison capacity measures vary

Prison capacity and the extent of crowding are difficult to
determine because of the absence of uniform measures for
defining capacity.  Jurisdictions apply a variety of capacity
measures to reflect both the available space to house inmates
and the ability to staff and operate an institution.  To
estimate the capacity of their prisons, jurisdictions were asked
to supply three measures for yearend 1999:  rated, operational,
and design capacities. These measures were defined as follows:

Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by a
rating official to institutions within the jurisdiction.

Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be
accommodated, based on a facility's staff, existing programs,
and services.

Design capacity is the number of  inmates that planners or
architects intended for the facility. 

Of the 51 reporting jurisdictions, 30 supplied a rated capacity;
44, an operational capacity; and 35, a design capacity. 
Twenty-one jurisdictions provided only 1 measure or the same
figure for each measure they reported.  For the 30 jurisdictions
with more than 1 reported type of capacity, estimates of
population as a percent of capacity are based on the highest and
lowest figures provided.

Seven States included private and contract facilities in their
capacity counts, and as a result, inmates held in these
facilities were added to the populations counts. California also
reported operational capacity for the first time.  To make valid
comparisons with previous years, the highest capacity totals
were based on California's design capacity .

Twenty-two States and Federal 
system were operating at or above 
capacity

Prisons generally require reserve capacity to operate
efficiently.  Dormitories and cells need to be maintained and
repaired periodically, special housing is needed for protective
custody and disciplinary cases, and space may be needed to cope
with emergencies.

At yearend 1999, 26 States and the District of Columbia reported
that they were operating at or below 99% of their highest
capacity.  Twenty-two States and the Federal prison system
reported operating at 100% or more of their highest capacity. 
Rhode Island, which was operating at 76% of its highest
capacity, reported the lowest percent of capacity occupied.
California, operating at 94% over its lowest reported capacity,
had the highest percent of capacity occupied.

By yearend 1999 the Federal prison system was estimated to be
operating at 32% over capacity, increasing since yearend 1998
(27%).  Overall, State prisons in 1999 were operating at 1%
above their highest capacity and  17% above their lowest
capacity. 

Black males outnumbered white
males among State and Federal
inmates at yearend 1999

Other            2.5         3.4
 
*Based on inmates with sentences of more than
1 year.

At yearend 1999, black inmates represented an estimated 46% of
all inmates with sentences of more than 1 year, while white
inmates accounted for 33% and Hispanic inmates, 18%.

Although the total number of sentenced inmates rose sharply (up
75% between 1990 and 1999), there were only small changes in the
racial and Hispanic composition of the inmate population.  At
yearend 1999, black males (558,700) outnumbered white males
(403,700) and Hispanic males (219,500) among inmates with
sentences of more than 1 year.  Nearly 43% of all sentenced
inmates were black males.

An estimated 9% of black males 
in their late twenties were in prison 
in 1999

When incarceration rates are estimated separately by age group,
black males in their twenties and thirties are found to have
high rates relative to other groups.  Expressed in terms of
percentages, 9.4% of black non-Hispanic males age 25 to 29 were
in prison in 1999, compared to 3.1% of Hispanic males and about
1.0% of white males in the same age group. Although
incarceration rates drop with age, the percentage of black males
age 45 to 54 in prison in 1999 was still nearly 2.8% -- only
slightly lower than the highest rate (3.1%) among Hispanic males
(age 25 to 29) and more than twice the highest rate (1.1%) among
white males (age 30 to 34).

Female incarceration rates, though substantially lower than male
incarceration rates at every age, reveal similar racial and
ethnic disparities. Black non-Hispanic females (with an
incarceration rate of 212 per 100,000) were more than twice as
likely as Hispanic females (87 per 100,000) and nearly 8 times
more likely than white non-Hispanic females (27 per 100,000) to
be in prison in 1999.  These differences among white, black, and
Hispanic females were consistent across all age groups. 

Growth linked to increasing number 
of inmates in State prison for violent 
and drug offenses

Between 1990 and 1998 the distribution of the four major offense
categories -- violent, property, drug, and public-order offenses
-- changed slightly among State prisoners. The percent held for
property and drug offenses dropped while the percent held for
public-order offenses rose.

Drug                22        21
Public-order         7        10
 
In absolute numbers, an estimated 545,200 inmates in State
prison at yearend 1998 were held for violent offenses, 159,600
for robbery, 134,600 for murder, 109,500 for assault, and
100,800 for rape and other sexual assaults.  In addition,
242,900 inmates were held for property offenses, 236,800 for
drug offenses, and 113,900 for public-order offenses.

Overall, the largest growth in State inmates between 1990 and
1998 was among violent offenders.  During the 8-year period, the
number of violent offenders grew 229,300, while the number of
drug offenders grew 87,100.  As a percentage of the total
growth, violent offenders accounted for 51% of the growth; drug
offenders 19%; property offenders 15%; and public-order
offenders 15%.

Sources of growth differ among
men and women and among white, 
black, and Hispanic inmates

The increasing number of violent offenders accounted for the 53%
of the total growth among male inmates and 27% among female
inmates.  Drug offenders accounted for the largest source of the
total growth among female inmates (36%), compared to 18% among
male inmates.  The increasing number of property offenses
accounted for a slightly higher percent of the growth among
female inmates (20%) than male inmates (15%).

Although the number of public-order offenders rose sharply, they
accounted for only 15% of the total growth among male inmates
and 17% of the growth among female inmates.

The sources of population growth also differed among white,
black, and Hispanic prisoners. Overall, the increasing number of
drug offenses accounted for 25% of the total growth among black
inmates, 18% of the total growth among Hispanic inmates, and 12%
of the growth among white inmates.  Violent offenders accounted
for the largest source of growth for all groups -- among white
State inmates (45%), black inmates (52%), and Hispanic inmates
(56%). 

Rise in State prison population 
linked to increasing numbers of 
parole violators returned to prison

Underlying the growth in the State prison population between
1990 and 1998 has been a 54% increase in the number of offenders
returned to prison for parole violations.  In 1998, 206,751 of
the offenders entering State prison had violated the conditions
of their release, up from 133,870 in 1990.

These offenders had been released to parole either by decision
of a parole board or by provision of the statute under which
they were sentenced.  The primary reason for their return to
prison was an arrest or conviction for a new offense.  Based on
reports from inmates in State prison in 1997 (the latest data),
60% of the inmates returned after serving time on parole had
been arrested or convicted for a new offense.  Nineteen percent
of the parole violators had absconded or failed to report to a
parole officer; 14% had a drug-related violation such as a
positive test, possession, or failure to report for testing or
treatment; and 14% had other reasons such as possession of a gun
or failure to report to counseling, to secure employment, or to
pay fines or fees.

*Data are from  the Survey of Inmates in State
Correctional Facilities, 1997.  Detail adds to more
than 100% because some inmates may have had
more than 1 reason.

Between 1990 and 1998 the number of new court commitments to
State prison rose from 323,069 to 347,270.  Though the number
admitted in 1998 was 7.5% larger than the number in 1990, the
number of new court commitments has fluctuated during the 9-year
period.

Parole violators returned on drug 
offenses more than doubled since 
1990

Drug offenders accounted for more than half of the total
increase in parole violators returned to State prison.  The
number of drug offenders returned to prison rose from 30,900 in
1990 to 68,600 in 1998 (representing 52% of the total 72,900
increase among returned parolees).

Though fewer in number, public-order offenders (primarily
weapons and DWI offenders) had the largest percentage increase
among returned parolees (up 123%). The number of parolees
returned to State prison on a violent offense also rose (up 51%)
but accounted for less than a quarter of the rise among returned
parolees.

In contrast to parole violators, growth in the number of new
court commitments to State prisons was largely  the result of an
increasing number of sentenced violent offenders (up 20%) and
public-order offenders (up 44%).  Courts sentenced 104,200
violent offenders to prison in 1998, up from 86,600 in 1990. 
The number of drug offenders entering prison directly from court
rose only slightly from 102,400 in 1990 to 107,000 in 1998 (an
increase of 4.5%).

State prison growth the result of 
declining release rates and increas-
ing time served

While the actual number of prisoners released each year grew
between 1990 and 1998, the rate of release (or the number
released relative to the number of inmates in prison) dropped
sharply.  In 1998, 520,172 offenders were released from State
prison, up from 405,374 in 1990.  However, the release rate
dropped from 37 per 100 State prisoners in 1990 to 31 per 100 in
1998.

A major source of  prison growth is increasing time served. 
Among inmates released from prison for the first time on their
current offense (that is, first releases) the average time
served increased from 22 months in 1990 to 28 months in 1998. 
The percentage of inmates released after serving 6 months or
less dropped  steadily from a peak in 1993 (29%) to 1998 (15%). 
At the same time, the percentage of release State prisoners
having served at least 10 years in prison edged upward, from
1.3% to 2.0%.

The projected average time to be served by inmates entering
prison before their first release also increased from 38 months
in 1990 to 43 months in 1998.

Changing Federal prison population 
related to drugs, weapons, and 
immigration violations

Prisoners sentenced for drug offenses constitute the largest
group of Federal inmates (58%) in 1998, up from 53% in 1990.  On
September 30, 1998, the date of the latest available data,
Federal prisons held 63,011 sentenced drug offenders, compared
to 30,470 at yearend 1990.

Between 1990 and 1998, the number of Federal inmates held for
immigration offenses increased 330% and the number held for
weapons offenses increased 185%.  The number of immigration
offenders rose from 1,728 in 1990 to 7,430 in 1998; weapons
offenders rose from 3,073 to 8,742.  By September 30, 1998,
weapons offenders represented 8.0% of Federal inmates and
immigration violators 6.8%.

Although the number of robbers showed an increase of 70% between
1990 and 1998, their increase was offset by a decline of nearly
20% among other violent offenders (such as inmates held for
assault and sex offenses).  Overall, the percentage of violent
Federal inmates declined from 17% to 12%.

While the number of offenders in each major offense category
increased, the number incarcerated for a drug offense accounted
for the largest percentage of the total growth (63%). 
Public-order offenders accounted for 26% of the increase;
violent offenders, 6%, and property offenders, 1%.

Factors contributing to the rise in the 
Federal inmate population between 
1990 and 1998 include --

*  an increase in defendants con- 
   victed in U.S. district courts from 
   47,494 to 60,958 

*  an increase in the percentage
   sentenced to prison from 60.3%
   to 69.6% 

*  an increase in the average time 
   expected to be served by persons 
   entering Federal prison from about 
   35 months to 45 months in 1998.*

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), with the U.S. Bureau of
the Census as its collection agent, obtains yearend and midyear
counts of prisoners from departments of correction in each of
the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Bureau
of Prisons.  In an effort to collect comparable data from all
jurisdictions, National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) distinguishes
prisoners in custody from those under jurisdiction.  To have
custody of a prisoner, a State must hold that person in one of
its facilities.  To have jurisdiction means that a State has
legal authority over the prisoner.  Prisoners under a State=s
jurisdiction may be in the custody of a local jail, another
State=s prison, or other correctional facility.  Some States are
unable to provide both custody and jurisdiction counts.  (See
NPS jurisdiction notes.)

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in locally
administered confinement facilities who are under the
jurisdiction of local authorities.  NPS counts include all
inmates in State-operated facilities in Alaska, Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which have combined
jail-prison systems.

Military Corrections Statistics

BJS obtains yearend counts of prisoners in the custody of U.S.
military authorities from the Department of Defense Corrections
Council.  In 1994 the council, comprised of representatives from
each branch of military service, adopted a standardized report
(DD Form 2720) with a common set of items and definitions.  This
report provides information on persons held in U.S. military
confinement facilities inside and outside the continental United
States, by branch of service, sex, race, Hispanic origin,
conviction status, sentence length, and offense.  It also
includes data on the number of facilities, and their design and
rated capacities.

Surveys of Inmates in State and 
Federal Correctional Facilities

The Surveys of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional
Facilities, which BJS conducts regularly every 5 to 6 years,
provide detailed data on individual characteristics of prison
inmates.  Based on scientifically selected samples of facilities
and of inmates held in them, these surveys provide detailed
information unavailable from any other source.  (See Substance
Abuse and  Treatment, State and Federal Prisoners, 1997, NCJ
172871, for a description of the 1997 surveys, sample designs,
and accuracy.) 

For this report, information on sex, 
race/Hispanic origin, age,  offense, 
and sentence length was drawn from the 
1997 surveys. 

National Corrections Reporting 
Program

BJS obtains data on sentence length and minimum time to be
served before first release for persons admitted to State prison
and time served by those released from State prison in the
National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP).  The data cover
persons released from custody regardless of the jurisdiction
where the prisoner was sentenced.  The number of jurisdictions
reporting data varies for year to year.  In 1998, 40 States and
the District of Columbia reported data on admissions and
releases.  While NCRP collects individual level data on all
offenders, time served calculations in this report were
restricted to prisoners with sentences of more than 1 year. 

Estimating age-specific
incarceration rates

The number of sentenced prisoners within each age group was
estimated for men, women, whites, blacks, and Hispanics. 
Estimates for 1999 were produced by combining data from NPS and
from the State and Federal prison inmate surveys.  The following
procedures were used:

1.  To obtain estimates of the number of sentenced State and
Federal inmates by sex, race, and Hispanic origin in each year,
NPS midyear 1999 custody counts for men and women were used. 
These counts of State and Federal inmates were multiplied by the
proportion white, black, Hispanic, or other race as estimated
from the State and Federal inmate surveys in 1997.  The
estimates were then adjusted to equal the number of sentenced
inmates by sex in State and Federal prisons as reported in NPS
for yearend 1999. 

2.  To obtain estimates by age in each year, age distributions
for each demographic group were drawn from the State and Federal
prison inmate surveys.  These percentages were then multiplied
by the number of sentenced inmates for each group defined by
sex, race, and Hispanic origin.

3.  Estimates of the U.S. resident population for July 1, 1999,
were obtained from the U.S. Bureau of the Census.  (See U.S.
Population Estimates, by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin:
1990 to 1995, PPL-41, and updates for 1999.)  These data were
then adjusted for the 1990 decennial census, using the 1990 Post
Enumeration Survey.

4.  Age-specific rates of incarceration  for each demographic
group were calculated by dividing the estimated number of
sentenced prisoners in each age group by the number of U.S.
residents in each age group and then multiplying by 100,000.
