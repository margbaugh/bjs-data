Highlights

**********

On June 30, 1995, the Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted an
enumeration of all State and Federal adult correctional
facilities.  These facilities included places of confinement
like prisons, prison hospitals, prison farms, boot camps, and
centers for reception, classification, or alcohol/drug
treatment, and community-based facilities like halfway houses
and work release centers. Facilities were included if they
housed primarily State or Federal prisoners; were physically,
functionally, and administratively separate from other
facilities; and were operational on the day of the census.

Jails and other local or regional detention facilities were
specifically excluded from the census, as were private
facilities not exclusively for State or Federal inmates.  Also
excluded were facilities for the military, Immigration and
Naturalization Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Marshals
Service, and correctional  hospital wards not operated by
correctional authorities.

Number of facilities

-----------------------

*The number of State and Federal correctional facilities in
operation increased 17%, from 1,287 at midyear 1990, when the
last census was conducted, to 1,500 at midyear 1995.  

*In 1995 States operated 1,375  facilities and the Federal
Bureau of Prisons operated 125 facilities. 

*About 1 in 6 State prisons or other types of correctional
facilities and 1 in 2 Federal facilities were added during the
early 1990's.

******************************************************************


Capacity

--------



*Each year from 1990 to 1995 the rated capacity of State
facilities expanded an average 6.9%.  In 1995 the capacity was
almost 910,000, up from 650,600 in 1990.  

*The increase in State capacity lagged inmate growth so that
percent of capacity occupied rose from 101% to 103%.

*Federal capacity in 1995 was nearly 66,000.  After 1990, rated
capacity grew annually at an average of 9.3% so that the percent
of Federal capacity occupied fell from 135% to 124%.

Facility types
--------------

*In both 1990 and 1995 community-based institutions -- those in
which half or more of the inmates are permitted to leave the
premises, unaccompanied -- accounted for about 20% of all
facilities. Confinement facilities accounted for 80%.  

*The distribution of inmates by type of facility remained
virtually unchanged from 1990 to 1995:  In 1990 all but 2% of
prisoners were housed in confinement facilities, and in 1995 all
but 3%. 

Security levels
----------------

*More State facilities of all security levels were in operation
in 1995 than 5 years earlier.  By contrast, the Federal system
operated more minimum security facilities and fewer maximum and
medium security institutions.

Court orders
------------

*Fewer facilities were under court orders or consent decrees to
limit population and for the totality of conditions in 1995 than
in 1990.  However, more were being cited for specific conditions
of confinement in 1995.

Number of inmates
-----------------

*The number of inmates in State and Federal correctional
facilities rose 43% from 715,649 in 1990 to 1,023,572 in 1995,
an average increase of about 7.5% per year.

*In both 1990 and 1995 about 20% of inmates were classified as
maximum security risks, 40% as medium security, and 33% as
minimum security.  The remainder were not assigned a custody
level or were regarded as very low risk.

Prisoner assaults
-----------------

*Inmates committed more assaults against staff and other inmates
during the annual period ending in 1995 than in 1990.  

*When inmate growth is considered, however, the 1995 rate of
assault was slightly lower than the 1990 rate.  The declining
rate of assault occurred in medium and minimum security
facilities.

Number of correctional employees
--------------------------------

*The number of employees in correctional facilities totaled
347,320 at midyear 1995, up from 264,201 in 1990.

*Nearly two-thirds of all correctional staff were in custody or
security positions.  At midyear 1995 nearly 221,000 employees
worked in custody or security positions, 56,000 in professional,
technical, or educational positions, 27,000 in clerical
positions, 24,000 in maintenance or food service, and 9,500 in
administration.

The 1995 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional
Facilities identified 1,500 facilities in operation at midyear 
 
*****************************************************************

Number of facilities   
--------------------

Overall, the number of correctional facilities, both confinement
and community-based, increased 17% from midyear 1990 when the
previous Census counted 1,287 facilities.

Facilities operating under State authority grew 14% from 1,207
to  1,375 while facilities operating under Federal authority
rose 56% from 80 to 125.  

The number of confinement facilities throughout the country
reached 1,196 in 1995, up 15% from 5 years earlier, and the
number of community-based facilities grew by 22% to 304.

Population   
----------

State and Federal  correctional facilities at midyear 1995 held
1,023,572 persons, 43% more than at midyear 1990, when 715,649
inmates were in custody.  The number of inmates per 100,000 U.S.
residents rose from 263 in 1990 to 390 in 1995.

Men and women   
-------------

94% of all inmates were men and 6% were women.  The number of
male inmates increased 42%, and female inmates, 56%, over the
5-year period.  

Type of facility   
----------------

97% of all State  and Federal prisoners were in  confinement
facilities where less  than half the population regularly leave
the premises unaccompanied by staff.  3% were in community-based
facilities where half or more of the population leave
unaccompanied.

From 1990 to 1995 the number of inmates increased slightly more
than facility capacity, making occupancy rise from 103% to 105%
of rated capacity

**********************************************************************

State facilities
----------------

The rated capacity grew 40% between 1990 and
1995, somewhat less than the 43% growth in State prisoners,
causing occupancy in State facilities to rise from 101% to 103%.

State facilities housing 1,000-2,499 inmates and 2,500 inmates
or more had population growths of 60% and 78%, respectively. 
Capacity increased less than the population so that  occupancy
went from 102% to 108% (1,000-2,499) and from 103% to 106%
(2,500 or more).

Federal facilities
------------------

Between 1990 and 1995 the rated capacity
rose 56%  while the prison population grew more than 44%. 
Occupancy thereby declined from 135% to 124%.

Facilities housing 1,000-2,499 people accounted for almost half
the Federal inmates in 1995.  From 1990 to 1995facilities of
this size had a population increase of 73% and a growth in
rated capacity of 77%.  In 1995, population was 145% of rated
capacity for facilities holding 1,000 to 2,499--higher than for
any other size category of facility.

All facilities
--------------

Over 50% of facilities held fewer than 500
inmates; about 20% held 500-999; about 20%, 1,000-2,499; and
less than 5%, 2,500.1990 and 1995   The percentage of  inmate
facilities with fewer than 500 inmates fell from 63% in 1990 to
57% in 1995.  More institutions housing 1,000 inmates or more
were in use in 1995 (24%) than 5 years earlier (16%).

Federal and State
-----------------

Facilities holding 500 or more inmates were more common in the 
Federal system (54%) than in State systems(42%).  

Regions
-------

The West, compared to other regions, had a distinctive
distribution of correctional facilities:  71% of the
institutions housed fewer than 500 inmates.

***************************************************************************************************************
As States and the Federal Prison System opened new institutions
or replaced old ones, the overall age  of the facilities fell
sharply:  In 1995, 51% of the facilities were less than 20 years
old, compared to 37% in 1990  
***************************************************************************************************************

Regions   
-------

Newer housing stock prevailed in every region of the country but 
was most notable in the Northeast where the proportion of institutions 
less than 20 years old rose from 30% in 1990 to 50% in 1995.   

Inmates   
-------

In 1995 well over half the inmates were housed in facilities built
after 1975.  In 1990, 4 in 10 inmates had been in facilities
less than 20 years old.  

The percentage of inmates in institutions 50 years old or older 
decreased from 38% in 1990 to 25% in 1995.  In 1995 nearly 56,000 
inmates were held in facilities that were at least 100 years old.

***************************************************************

Despite the addition of facilities or the replacement of old
ones after 1990, the mix of facilities with maximum, medium, or
minimum security levels remained about the same in 1995

***************************************************************
Security levels
---------------

Maximum security confinement facilities comprised 23% of State 
and Federal facilities in 1990 and 25% in 1995. Medium security 
institutions were 38% and minimum security facilities 37% of the
total in 1995.

Facility size and security level
--------------------------------

Maximum security facilities were most likely large institutions, 
and minimum security facilities, small institutions.  Over half 
the maximum security facilities in 1995 housed 1,000 inmates or 
more.  About 80% of the minimum security facilities held fewer 
than 500 each. Medium security facilities were of every size:  
31% small capacity, 29% medium, and 40% large capacity.

Sex of inmates and security level
---------------------------------

About 85% of both maximum and medium security facilities held  
men only, and 7% or 8% women only, and 7% or 8% both sexes.  
Minimum security institutions in 1995 were slightly less likely 
than other facilities to house men only (83%), more likely to 
house women only (11%), and about as likely to house both sexes (6%).

**************************************************************

The percentage of inmates held in maximum security facilities
remained stable between 1990 and 1995

**************************************************************


State
-----

In both 1990 and 1995, about the same proportions of
State prisoners were kept in maximum (under 40% of all inmates),
medium (almost 50%), or minimum (10%) security facilities.



Federal
-------

Compared to State inmates in 1995, smaller percentages
of Federal inmates were in maximum (11%) or medium (32%)
security facilities.  Most Federal inmates were in minimum (57%)
security institutions.



Between 1990 and 1995 the proportion of Federal prisoners in
maximum security institutions remained nearly unchanged.  
Medium security facilities held a declining percentage of
inmates as minimum security facilities held an increasing one. 



Community-based facilities
-------------------------- 

Between 1990 and 1995 the number of State community-based 
inmates living in medium security institutions increased 84%, 
and those in minimum security facilities, 76%.  All Federal 
community-based facilities were minimum security.

****************************************************************

The custody levels of State inmates, like the security levels of
the facilities, were similarly distributed in 1990 and 1995: 
The percentage of maximum security prisoners remained about 21%

****************************************************************

State
-----

In 1995 about 21% of prisoners were classified as maximum
security, 43% as medium security, and 35% as minimum security.

Federal
-------

The number of inmates classified as medium security
fell from 58% to 32% of all inmates, as  minimum security
expanded from 35% to 57%.  The number of maximum security
inmates increased from 7% to 11% of all Federal inmates. 

Population increases
--------------------

Among the State custody levels between 1990 and 1995, the rate 
of increase for minimum security inmates was highest: 58%.  
The number classified as medium security went
up 49% and those classified as maximum, 32%. 


During this period the number of minimum security Federal
inmates jumped 158% and maximum security inmates increased 149%,
while the number of medium security prisoners in the Federal
system declined 14%.

Deaths
------

The number of inmate deaths rose 92%, from 1,729 during
the 12 months preceding the 1990 census to 3,311 during the 12
months preceding the 1995 census.

The number of inmate deaths rose from 2.4 per 1,000 State
inmates in 1990 to 3.4 in 1995.  The death rate declined in
Federal prisons, from 2.9 per 1,000 inmates held in 1990 to 2.7
in 1995.

Noncitizens
-----------

The number of noncitizens more than doubled, from
25,250 in 1990 to 51,500 in 1995.  In 1995 5.0% of State and
Federal prisoners were noncitizens, up from 3.5% in 1990.

**********************************************************

In both 1990 and 1995 over a quarter of State correctional
facilities operated under a court order or consent decree

**********************************************************

State
-----

378 correctional facilities (27%) were under court order
or consent decree for specific conditions, to limit population,
or for the totality of conditions at midyear 1995.  

Five years earlier 323 State facilities, 27% of those in
operation in 1990, were under court order.

Causes for orders
-----------------

Crowding was the most frequently citedspecific condition in 
1995, affecting 213 facilities, followed
by medical facilities (139), library services (129), and
staffing (118).

More facilities were under court directives to remedy specific
conditions in 1995 (321) than in 1990 (242).  Fewer institutions
were ordered to limit population in 1995 (174 versus 183).

Two causes cited in 1995 were absent in 1990:  74 facilities
were to revise policies concerning inmate rights to religious
expression, and 30 facilities were to modify search policies.

Federal
-------

113 Federal Bureau of Prisons facilities were under
court order in 1995: 112 to modify the inmate phone service and
1 to limit the facility population.  No Federal facility was
under court order in 1990.

**********************************************************

The pattern of correctional job categories varied greatly
between the State and Federal prison systems

**********************************************************

Federal and State
-----------------

41% of the Federal and 65% of the State
correctional employees were reported to be in custody or
security occupations.  This difference may reflect the smaller
percentage of prisoners sentenced for violent crime in Federal
prisons than in State facilities.  

Because State correctional facilities hold a higher percentage
of prisoners in maximum security, a similarly greater percentage
of correctional officers is required to staff those facilities. 
Also, the Federal Bureau of Prisons trains and continually
qualifies much of its staff to perform custody and security
functions in addition to the duties of other occupations. 

About 6% of all Federal correctional workers were classified as
administrative, compared to about 3% of State correctional staff.

West and South
--------------

Regional differences in job categories were fairly small.  
The West and South were the regions with the
greatest differences in the employment mix.

Custody and security personnel were about 67% of all staff in
the  Northeast and South but 62% in the West.  Professional and
technical staff comprised 15% of all State correctional workers
in the South but 10% in the West.  The larger categories in the
West, when compared to the South, included clerical staff, 10%
versus 6%, and maintenance and food service employees, 8% versus
5%.

Over 300,000 employees worked in facilities holding men only,
over 20,000 worked in facilities for women alone, and over
24,000 worked in facilities housing both sexes 

************************************************************

Facilities for men or women
----------------------------

88% of all confinement facility employees worked where 
there were male inmates only, 6% where there were female inmates only, 
and 6% in facilities for both sexes.  A larger proportion of the staff 
in community-based facilities worked where there were both sexes (21%), a
relatively smaller proportion in facilities for men only (72%),
and about the same proportion in facilities for women only (7%).
 
State and Federal
-----------------

State confinement employees were slightly more likely to be working 
in institutions for both sexes (7%)than were Federal employees (5%), 
and slightly less likely to be performing their duties in facilities 
for men only (87% versus 89%). 

Personnel categories
--------------------

In both State and Federal prison systems, custody/ security and clerical 
employees were the occupational groups most likely to be working in confinement 
institutions for men only (89% of both categories); and professional/technical
staff, the least likely (84%).

Black non-Hispanics were 20% of the staff and 48% of the
inmates; Hispanics, 6% and 14%; and other races, 2% of both
staff and inmates. 

A smaller proportion of community-based payroll employees were
white non-Hispanic (54%) than were confinement facility workers
(72%). Relatively more community-based staff were black
non-Hispanic: (39% of community-based staff and 20% of
confinement staff).

**************************************************************

The number of inmates per employee was lowest in State
confinement facilities and highest in Federal community-based
facilities

**************************************************************

Inmate-to-employee ratios
-------------------------

At midyear 1995 the overall number of inmates per correctional 
facility employee was lowest in State confinement institutions 
(2.9 to 1).  The ratios for other types of facilities were as follows:  
Federal confinement (3.2 to 1) State community-based (3.8 to 1) 
Federal community-based (3.9 to 1).

Custody and security staff
--------------------------

Based on the number of inmates at midyear 1995 divided by all 
payroll, nonpayroll, full-time, part-time, and contract staff, 
excluding community volunteers--the inmate-to-staff ratio was 
lowest among custody or security staff in State-operated confinement 
facilities (4.4), and second lowest among custody or security staff 
in State-operated community-based facilities (6.1).

For most occupational categories, the Federal system held fewer
inmates per employee than the State systems overall.  Custody or
security staff were the exception:  For each correctional
officer, the Federal system had 7.9 inmates and State
institutions, 4.4 inmates.

Correctional facilities held more prisoners per employee in 1995
than in 1990

Inmate-to-employee ratios
-------------------------

The overall inmate-to-staff ratio increased from 2.7 inmates per 
employee (1990) to 2.9 (1995). In confinement facilities it rose 
from 2.7 to 2.9, and in community-based facilities, from 3.1 to 3.8.  
Inmate-to-staff ratios rose in all occupational categories from 1990 to 1995. 
The largest increases were among administrative workers -- 96.9
in 1990 versus 107.6 in 1995, and maintenance and food service
employees, 32.7 versus 43.4.  

Custody and security
--------------------

The smallest increases in inmate-to-staff ratios were among custody 
and security employees: The number of inmates per confinement staff 
member rose from 4.2 in 1990 to 4.6 in 1995, and the number per 
community-based staff member grew from 5.1 to 6.2.

The number of private correctional facilities and inmates in
them increased from 1990 to 1995

************************************************************

State and Federal facilities
----------------------------

The number of private faciliities operating under contract to State  
or Federal authorities increased 64% from 67 in 1990 to 110 in 1995.

State and Federal inmates
-------------------------

The average daily number of inmates incarcerated in private facilities 
more than doubled from 7,771 to 16,426.

Midyear 1995
------------

The 110 private facilities in operation accounted
for 7% of the Nation's total correctional housing stock.  The
16,426 inmates in private institutions accounted for 2% of the
total prisoner population.  

Community-based facilities
--------------------------

Nearly 3 in every 4 private correctional facilities were 
community-based, that is, institutions in which 50% or more 
of the residents were permitted to leave, unaccompanied by 
staff for work or study. 

More than 9 in every 10 held fewer than 500 inmates; 9 in every
10 were classified as minimum security institutions; and nearly
3 in every 4 functioned  primarily as work release or prerelease
facilities.

*************************************************************

A half of 1% of all State prisoners in 1995 were under age 18 

*************************************************************

State
-----

State correctional facilities held a total of 5,309
inmates under age 18 at midyear 1995, about  of 1% of all State
inmates.  The number of prisoners under 18 rose 47% from 3,600
at midyear 1990.  This was a slightly larger increase than that
of the overall State prisoner population (43%).

Security level
--------------

Nearly all  the prisoners under age 18 were held
in confinement facilities.  About 47% of these youngest
prisoners were in maximum security institutions, 42% in medium
security, and 11% in minimum security.   

Regions
-------

The West reported the highest proportion of inmates
under age 18 who were assigned to maximum security prisons (65%
of the young prisoners), followed by the Northeast (54%), the
South (42%), and the Midwest (41%).

Federal
-------

No inmates in Federal facilities were under age 18;
however, 64 persons in the age group were housed under contract
outside the Federal system.

Note:  Correctional reporting authorities use a variety of
capacity measures to reflect both available space to house
inmates and the ability to staff and operate an institution. 
Design capacity is the number of inmates or residents that
planners or architects intended.  Rated capacity is the  number
of beds or inmates assigned by a rating official.  Percent of
capacity occupied is  determined by dividing the number of
inmates or residents housed on the day  of the census by the
reported capacity.

Methodology

************

The 1995 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional
Facilities was the fifth enumeration of State institutions and
the second of Federal institutions sponsored by the Bureau of
Justice Statistics.  Earlier censuses were completed in 1974,
1979, 1984, and 1990.

The facility universe was developed from the Census of State and
Federal Adult Correctional Facilities conducted in 1990.  Each
department of corrections was contacted to identify new
facilities and facilities that had been closed since June 30,
1990.  Telephone follow-ups with data providers were carried out
in the fall of 1995 and resulted in a final response rate of
100%.

Facilities were included in the census if they were staffed with
Federal, State, local, or private employees; housed primarily
State or Federal prisoners; were physically, functionally, and
administratively separate from other facilities; and were
operational on June 30, 1995. The census also included 110
private facilities under exclusive contract to State governments
or to the Federal Bureau of Prisons to house prisoners.

The Census included the following types of State and Federal
adult correctional facilities: prisons; prison farms; reception,
diagnostic and classification centers; road camps; forestry and
conservation camps; youthful offender facilities (except in
California); vocational training facilities; drug and alcohol
treatment facilities; and State-operated local detention
facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode
Island, and Vermont.  (Of these six States only Alaska had some
locally administered correctional facilities _ five local jails.)

Jails and other local regional detention facilities, including
those housing State prisoners, were specifically excluded from
the census, as were private facilities not exclusively for State
or Federal inmates.  Also excluded were facilities for the
military, Immigration and Naturalization Service, Bureau of
Indian Affairs, U.S. Marshals Service, and  correctional
hospital wards not operated by correctional authorities.

Correctional facilities were classified as community-based if
50% or more of the residents were regularly permitted to leave,
unaccompanied, to work or study.  These facilities included
halfway houses, restitution centers, and prerelease, work
release, and study release centers.  Correctional facilities in
which less than 50% of the inmates regularly left the facility
unaccompanied were classified as confinement institutions.

Because the census was a complete 

enumeration, the results were not subject to sampling error. 
The census counted prisoners held in the facilities, a custody
count, rather than prisoners over whom correctional authorities
exercised control, a jurisdictional count.
