The LEMAS survey

During 2003 the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
(BJS), as part of its Law Enforcement 
Management and Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) 
program, surveyed a nationally representative 
sample of State and local law enforcement 
agencies operating nationwide. Previous LEMAS 
surveys were conducted in 1987, 1990, 1993,
1997, 1999 (limited scope), and 2000.

This report presents data from the 2003 survey
describing the more than 3,000 sheriffs' offices 
operating in the United States in terms of 
their personnel, expenditures and pay, operations, 
community policing initiatives, written policies 
and procedures, computers and information systems, 
and equipment. Comparisons are made with prior 
years where appropriate.

Sheriffs' offices typically serve counties and 
independent cities. Although sheriffs' offices 
may have countywide jail and court-related 
responsibilities, their law enforcement
jurisdictions typically exclude county areas 
served by a local police department. In certain 
counties some municipalities contract with the 
sheriffs' office for law enforcement services. 
In counties and independent cities with a 
separate police department, the sheriffs' 
office may not have any primary law enforcement 
jurisdiction.

The 2003 LEMAS survey questionnaire was mailed 
to 3,154 State and local law enforcement 
agencies (see Methodology for a description of 
the sample). The overall response rate was 91%. 

This report and its companion report, Local 
Police Departments, 2003, summarize data 
collected from agencies of all sizes. Agency-
level data for agencies with 100 or more 
officers will be published in the BJS report, 
Law Enforcement Management and Administrative 
Statistics, 2003.

Personnel

As of June 30, 2003, sheriffs' offices had an 
estimated 330,274 full-time employees. 
Approximately 174,300, or 53%, of full-time 
sheriffs' office employees were sworn personnel 
(those with general arrest powers). Sheriffs'
offices also employed about 24,000 persons on 
a part-time basis, which includes about 9,500 
sworn officers.

Sheriffs' offices employed one-quarter of full-
time sworn officers working for State and local 
general purpose law enforcement agencies 
nationwide. Their 156,022 full-time civilian 
employees comprised half of nonsworn State and 
local law enforcement employees. 

From 1987 (the first year of the LEMAS survey) 
to 2003, overall employment by sheriffs' 
offices increased by about 141,000, or 75% -- an 
average of 4.7% annually. The number of full-time 
sworn officers increased by about 45,500, or 35%, 
during this period.

There were about 36,500 more full-time sheriffs' 
office employees in 2003 than in 2000, an increase 
of 12.4%, or about 4.1% annually. When only sworn 
personnel are considered, employment by sheriffs' 
offices increased by about 9,500, or 5.8%, from 
2000 to 2003. 

From 1987 to 2003 the number of full-time 
civilian sheriffs' office employees 
increased from 60,506 to 156,022, or 158%. 
This included an increase of about 26,900, 
or 21%, from 2000 to 2003.

Nationwide, 354, or 11.6% of sheriffs' offices, 
employed at least 100 sworn personnel. This 
included 13 sheriffs' offices with 1,000 or 
more officers. The Los Angeles County Sheriffs' 
Office was the largest, with about 8,600 
officers (see exhibit 1). An estimated 732, or 
23.9%, of sheriffs' offices employed fewer than 
10 officers, including 19 with 1 officer (the 
sheriff).
                                 
Nineteen percent of all full-time officers were 
employed by a department with 1,000 or more 
sworn personnel, and 65% were employed by a 
department with at least 100 sworn personnel. 
Sheriffs' offices that employed fewer than 10 
officers accounted for about 2% of all 
officers nationwide.  

Although 71% of all sheriffs' offices served 
fewer than 50,000 residents, these agencies 
employed 20% of all officers. About half of 
all officers served a jurisdiction with 
250,000 or more residents. 

Sheriffs' offices serving the largest 
jurisdictions had thousands of full-time 
employees on average, while those serving the 
smallest ones had an average of 11 full-time 
employees, including 6 sworn officers.

Part-time employees were more common among
sheriffs' offices serving larger jurisdictions, 
ranging from an average of 2 in the smallest 
jurisdictions to 89 in the largest. The 
highest average number of sworn part-time
employees was 39, among sheriffs' offices 
serving 1 million or more residents.

Overall, 52% of full-time officers had regularly 
assigned duties that included responding to calls 
for service. The proportion of officers responding 
to calls ranged from less than half among sheriffs' 
offices serving 250,000 or more residents, to about 
9 in 10 in those serving fewer than 10,000 residents.

As of June 30, 2003, sheriffs' offices collectively
employed 97% of the maximum number of full-time
sworn personnel authorized by their budgets. The
highest actual-to-authorized ratio for full-time 
sworn personnel was among offices serving 50,000 
to 99,999 residents (99%).

Officer separations and new hires

Sixty-nine percent of sheriffs' offices experienced 
officer separations during the 12-month period 
ending June 30, 2003. Nearly all sheriffs' 
offices serving a population of 250,000 or more 
had officer separations during the 12-month 
period, compared to less than half of those
serving a population under 10,000.

The average number of separations across all 
agencies was 6 officers, ranging from 2 officers 
among sheriffs' offices serving fewer than 25,000 
residents to nearly 100 officers among sheriffs' 
offices serving 1 million or more residents.

During the same time period, 71% of sheriffs' 
offices hired new officers. The average number 
of new hires across all agencies was 6 officers, 
ranging from 2 among sheriffs' offices serving 
fewer than 10,000 residents to 66 among sheriffs' 
offices serving 1 million or more residents.

Overall, an estimated 13,538 full-time sworn 
officers separated from sheriffs' offices during 
the 12-month period ending June 30, 2003. An 
estimated 58% (7,905 officers) of these 
separations were due to resignations, 20%(2,719 
officers) were due to nonmedical retirements, 
9% (1,210 officers) were dismissals, 5% (703 
officers) were medical/disability retirements, 
and 3% (368 officers) were probationary 
rejections.

About three-quarters of the separations in 
sheriffs' offices serving fewer than 25,000 
residents were due to resignations, compared 
to less than half in those serving a 
population of 500,000 or more. In contrast, 
about 30% of the separations in the largest 
jurisdictions were due to nonmedical 
retirements, compared to under 10% in the 
smallest.

Overall, sheriffs' offices hired an estimated 
13,858 new full-time sworn officers during the 
12-month period ending June 30, 2003. The total 
included 11,277 entry-level hires (81%), 2,180 
lateral transfers (16%), and 401 other new 
hires (3%).

The largest number of new hires (3,091 officers, 
or 22% of all new hires) was among sheriffs' 
offices serving populations of 100,000 to 
249,999, followed by those serving 250,000 to 
499,999 residents (2,221 officers, or about 16% 
of all new hires). Sheriffs' offices serving 
the smallest jurisdictions had the fewest new 
hires (538 officers, or 4% of all new hires). 

Six percent of sheriffs' offices experienced 
separations without any new hires during the 
12-month period. These agencies had an 
estimated 538 separations. Eight percent of 
sheriffs' offices experienced new hires 
without any separations. These agencies 
had an estimated 533 new hires. 

Net personnel change, 2002-2003

The 13,858 new hires by sheriffs' offices during 
the year ending June 30, 2003 and the 13,538 
separations over the same period represent an 
estimated net increase overall(excluding lateral 
transfers) of 320 full-time officers.

Overall, agencies serving 1 million or more 
residents experienced a net loss of 1,102 
officers, the only decrease in any population 
category. 

The largest increase in number of officers was 
in jurisdictions serving populations of 250,000 
to 499,999 residents, where 334 more officers 
were serving in June 2003 compared to a year 
earlier. The next largest increases were in 
jurisdictions with 100,000 to 249,999 residents 
(277 more officers) or 25,000 to 49,999
residents (269 more officers).
 
Military reservists called to active duty

During the 12-month period ending June 30, 2003, 
31% of sheriffs' offices had full-time sworn 
personnel who were called up as full-time 
military reservists and were, therefore, no 
longer available for law enforcement duties.
All offices serving 1 million or more 
residents had call-ups, as did about 9 in 10 
offices serving 250,000 to 999,999 residents. 
Eight percent of those serving fewer than 
10,000 residents had call-ups.

Overall, about 2,800 officers were called-up 
for reserve military service. About half of 
them came from sheriffs' offices serving 
250,000 or more residents. The average number 
of officers called up was 3, ranging from 1 
officer among sheriffs' offices serving fewer 
than 25,000 residents to 20 officers among 
those serving a population of 1 million or 
more. 

Reserve or auxiliary officers

Some sheriffs' offices partly offset officer 
shortages through the use of supplemental 
personnel, such as sworn reserve or auxiliary 
officers. As of June 30, 2003, 44% of sheriffs' 
offices were using part-time sworn reserve or 
auxiliary officers, with an average of 16
officers each. Overall, sheriffs' offices 
employed 20,844 such officers. Thirteen percent 
of sheriffs' offices were using full-time sworn 
reserve or auxiliary officers, with a total of 
5,209 nationwide. The average number of sworn
auxiliary officers was 13. 

Thirteen percent of sheriffs' offices were 
using part-time nonsworn reserve or auxiliary 
officers, with a total of nearly 11,000 used 
nationwide. An estimated 2% of all offices 
were using full-time nonsworn reserve or 
auxiliary officers, with an overall total of 
about 1,100.

Gender and race of officers

Of the 174,251 full-time sworn personnel in 
sheriffs' offices as of June 2003, an estimated 
12.9% were women. The percentage of female 
officers ranged from about 15% in sheriffs' 
offices serving 500,000 or more residents to 
5% in those serving fewer than 10,000
residents. 

In 2003 the estimated 22,411 female officers
represented an increase of about 960, or 5%, 
from 2000. During this time, female 
representation among officers increased from 
12.5% to 12.9%, but female representation 
has not changed substantially since 1987,
when women comprised 12.6% of all officers.

In 2003 an estimated 18.8% of full-time 
officers were members of a racial or ethnic 
minority. Minority officers comprised about 
a third of the total in jurisdictions with 
1 million or more residents.

Blacks or African Americans accounted for 
10.0% of all officers in 2003. Black 
employment was highest among sheriffs' 
offices serving a population of 500,000 to
999,999 (14.2%).

An estimated 6.9% of officers nationwide 
were Hispanic or Latino, with the highest 
representation among sheriffs' offices 
serving a population of 1 million or more 
(15.8%).

The number of officers who were members of 
a racial or ethnic minority in 2003(32,726) 
represented an increase of about 3,400, or 
12%, over 2000 levels. From 2000 to 2003 
minority representation increased from 
17.1% to 18.7%. In 1987, minorities comprised 
13.4% of all officers. 

The estimated 17,473 full-time black officers 
employed in 2003 was an increase of about 1,990, 
or 13%, compared to 2000. During this time, the 
percentage of officers who were black increased 
from 9.4% to 10.0%. In 1987, blacks comprised 
8.3% of officers. 

An estimated 12,007 Hispanic officers were 
employed by sheriffs' offices in 2003. This 
was about 1,960, or 20%, more than in 2000. 
From 2000 to 2003, the percentage of 
officers who were Hispanic rose from 6.1% 
to 6.9%. In 1987, 4.3% of officers were 
Hispanic. 

From 2000 to 2003 representation by other 
minority groups such as Asians, Pacific 
Islanders, and American Indians increased 
by about 500, or 20%, to about 3,200
officers. These groups comprised 1.9% of 
officers in 2003 compared to 1.6% in 2000, 
and 0.8% in 1987. 

Screening of officer applicants 

Sheriffs' offices employed a variety of 
screening methods when hiring new officers. 
Nearly all used personal interviews (99%), 
and a majority used medical exams (76%) and 
drug tests (68%). Among sheriffs' offices
serving 100,000 or more residents, a 
majority used psychological evaluations, 
physical agility tests, and written 
aptitude tests. More than half of sheriffs' 
offices serving 250,000 or more residents 
used polygraph exams.

In addition to interviews, tests, and 
examinations, nearly all sheriffs' offices 
screened recruits through criminal record 
checks (99%), background investigations (96%),
and driving record checks (94%). Nearly half 
conducted credit record checks (48%), 
including a majority of those serving 50,000 
or more residents.

Nearly all officers were employed by a 
sheriff's office that used criminal record 
checks (99%), personal interviews (98%), 
background investigations (98%), and driving
record checks (95%). More than 4 in 5 
officers were employed by an office that 
used medical exams (87%), and drug tests (85%). 
More than two-thirds were employed by one using 
psychological evaluations (72%)and credit checks 
(69%). More than half of officers worked in 
sheriffs' offices using written aptitude tests
(58%) and physical agility tests (54%).

Education and training requirements

Nearly all(99%)sheriffs' offices had an education
requirement for new officer recruits. Eleven 
percent of sheriffs' offices had some type of 
college requirement, with 5% requiring a 2-year 
degree.

In 2003 the percentage of officers employed by 
a sheriffs' office with some type of college 
requirement for new officers (11%) was 
slightly less than in 2000 (13%), but nearly 
3 times as high as in 1990 (4%). 

In the largest jurisdictions new deputy 
recruits were required to complete more than 
1,200 hours of training on average, compared 
to about 800 hours in the smallest. Overall, 
about three-fourths of the training hours 
required for new recruits were State mandated,
with the remainder an agency requirement. For 
greater detail on basic law enforcement 
training, see State and Local Law Enforcement 
Training Academies, 2002. 

From 2000 to 2003 there were increases in training
requirements for new deputy recruits in all 
population categories. In jurisdictions with 
500,000 or more residents, the combined field and 
academy training requirement rose from 918 hours 
to 1,223 hours; with 100,000 to 499,999 residents, 
from 944 to 1,077; with 25,000 to 99,999 residents, 
from 700 to 933; and with fewer than 25,000 
residents, from 555 to 778 hours. 

The average annual in-service training requirement 
for non-probationary officers was 49 hours, 
including 28 State-mandated hours.

Overall, 9% of sheriffs' offices operated a 
training academy; however, a majority of those 
serving a population of 500,000 or more did so. 
Nationwide, 39% of all officers were employed 
by a department that operated an academy. 

Budget and pay

Operating budgets

The total operating budget of sheriffs' offices 
during fiscal 2003 was about $22.3 billion. This 
was 18% more than in 2000 after adjusting for 
inflation. (These figures do not include budgets 
for capital expenditures such as equipment 
purchases or construction projects.) Sheriffs'
offices accounted for 30% of the $73.6 billion 
in total operating budgets for general purpose 
State and local law enforcement agencies.  

Nationwide, operating budgets were about $7.3 
million per sheriffs' office for fiscal 2003, 
ranging from about $226 million for those 
serving a population of 1 million or more, to 
$518,000 among those serving fewer than 10,000 
residents.  

The overall operating cost per resident was $82, 
with sheriffs' offices in jurisdictions with a 
population of 1 million or more costing the most 
to operate, $102 per resident, followed by those 
serving populations of under 10,000, $98 
per resident. Sheriffs' offices serving a
population of 25,000 to 49,999 had the 
lowest per resident cost -- about $65. 

Nationwide, sheriffs' offices cost an estimated 
$124,400 per sworn officer to operate for fiscal 
2003. Those serving a population of 1 million 
or more ($161,600 per officer) cost about twice 
as much to operate as those serving fewer than 
10,000 residents ($80,300). 

When both sworn and nonsworn personnel are 
included, sheriffs' offices cost $65,100 per 
employee to operate for the year. Operating 
costs ranged from about $86,000 per employee 
in jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents
to about $43,000 per employee in those with 
fewer than 10,000 residents. 

After controlling for inflation per officer 
operating costs for 2003 were $9,000, or 8%, 
higher than in 2000. The largest increase, from 
$78,600 to $93,900, was recorded in 
jurisdictions with 25,000 to 99,999 residents. 
There was a slight decrease, from $80,300 to 
$78,700, in jurisdictions with fewer than 
25,000 residents.

10,000.

Average minimum starting salaries for first-line
supervisors (sergeant or equivalent) ranged from
$56,200 in the largest jurisdictions to $28,000 
in the smallest. When size of agency is considered, 
the average minimum starting salary earned by 
sergeants was about $43,700.

By agency the average base starting salary offered 
to entry-level deputies in 2003 was $26,300. Starting
salaries ranged from $23,300 in jurisdictions with 
fewer than 10,000 residents to $38,800 in those with 
a population of 1 million or more. When size of 
agency is factored in, it is estimated that new 
entry-level deputies started at an average salary 
of about $32,600 during 2003. This was 14% more 
than in 2000; and a 6% increase after adjusting 
for inflation. 

By population category inflation-adjusted salaries
increased the most in jurisdictions with 500,000 
or more residents, from $31,849 to $36,161, or 14%. 
In jurisdictions with 100,000 to 499,999 residents, 
salaries rose 12%, from $27,215 to $30,586; in 
those with 25,000 to 99,999 residents, they rose

Community policing

Community policing promotes and supports
organizational strategies to address the causes 
and reduce the fear of crime and social disorder 
through problem-solving tactics and police-community
partnerships. Balancing responses to calls for 
service with proactive problem solving, effective 
community policing requires police and citizens to 
join together in identifying and addressing 
underlying causes of crime and disorder. The 
implementation of a community policing plan 
supports and empowers front-line officers,
decentralizes command, and encourages innovative
problem solving. For more information see the COPS
office website at <http://www.Cops.usdoj.gov>. 

In 2003, 10% of sheriffs' offices, employing 31% 
of all officers, had a formally written community 
policing plan. This included 54% of the sheriffs' 
offices serving a population of 1 million or more. 

Among the 64% of sheriffs' offices that had an 
agency mission statement in 2003, just under half

the 1-year period.

Community policing personnel

Overall, 51% of sheriffs' offices, employing 70% of 
all officers, had full-time sworn personnel serving 
as community policing officers. In some 
jurisdictions these officers are known as community 
relations officers, community resource officers, or 
some other name indicative of the community policing 
approach they employ. Nationwide, sheriffs' offices 
employed an estimated 14,900 community policing 
officers or their equivalent. 

A majority of the sheriffs' offices serving a 
population of 25,000 or more had full-time 
community policing officers. Those serving a 
population of 1 million or more employed 137 such

fewer than 10,000 residents employed 4
community policing officers on average.

In all population categories the percentage of 
sheriffs' offices using community policing 
officers in 2003 was greater than in 1997, but 
less than in 2000. In jurisdictions with fewer 
than 25,000 residents, the percentage rose from 
15% in 1997 to 63% in 2000, then dropped to 44% 
in 2003; in those with 25,000 to 99,999 residents,

approach to provide a safe environment for 
students and staff. In addition to handling calls 
for service within the school, they work closely 
with school administrators and staff to prevent 
crime and disorder by monitoring crime trends, 
problem areas, cultural conflicts, and other 
areas of concern. 

As of June 2003 sheriffs' offices had an estimated 
5,554 full-time sworn personnel assigned as school 
resource officers, about 240 more than in June 2000.

criteria. This included about 30% of those
serving 500,000 or more residents. 

An estimated 36% of sheriffs' offices, employing 
59% of all officers, enhanced their proactive role 
in solving community problems by partnering with

offices serving a population of 500,000 or more 
and about half of those serving populations of
50,000 to 249,999.

residents. 

About 6 in 10 sheriffs' offices, including about 
8 in 10 offices serving 250,000 or more residents, 
had problem-solving partnerships or written 
agreements with community groups, local agencies, 
or others during the year ending June 30, 2003. 
Sheriffs' offices having partnerships or written 
agreements employed 78% of all officers.

Sheriffs' offices had partnerships or written 
agreements with a wide variety of groups. Half or 
more of all officers worked for a department that

continued the trend observed from 1997 to 2000. 
Among sheriffs' offices serving 500,000 or more 
residents, 26% used electronic methods in 2003, 
compared to 21% in 2000 and 12% in 1997. The 
percentage of sheriffs' offices in other
population categories using electronic methods 
in 2003, 2000, and 1997 are as follows: 100,000 
to 499,999 residents 40%, 27% 16%; 25,000 to 
99,999 residents: 44%, 18%, 12%; under 25,000 
residents, 45%,18%, 14%.

Methodology

The Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS) survey collects data from a 
nationally representative sample of publicly 
funded State and local law enforcement agencies 
in the United States.  

This report presents data from the 2003 survey
describing local police departments in terms of 
their personnel, expenditures and pay, operations, 
community policing initiatives, equipment, 
computers and information systems, and written 
policies.  

The 2003 LEMAS sample design called for the survey
questionnaire to be mailed to 3,179 State and 
local law enforcement agencies. Twenty-five 
agencies were determined to be out-of-scope for 
the survey because they had closed, outsourced 
their operations, or were operating on a part-time 
basis, resulting in a final mailout total of 
3,154 agencies. The initial mailing of the
questionnaire was conducted in December 2003. 
The pay period containing June 30, 2000 was 
used as the reference date for all questions, 
unless otherwise noted. 

Allowing for the exclusion of special 
jurisdiction agencies and Texas constables, 
955 law enforcement agencies in the United 
States with 100 or more sworn officers as of
June 30, 2000, were included in the sample 
as self-representing (SR) agencies. This 
included 574 local police departments, 332 
sheriffs' offices, and the 49 primary State 
law enforcement agencies. 

The self-representing (SR) agencies were 
supplemented by a nationally representative 
sample of agencies with fewer than 100 sworn 
personnel. These nonself-representing (NSR) 
agencies were chosen using a stratified 
random sample with cells based on the type
of agency (local police or sheriff), size of 
population served, and number of sworn personnel. 
The 2,199 NSR agencies selected included 1,539 
local police departments and 660 sheriffs' 
offices.

A total of 2,859 agencies responded to the LEMAS
questionnaire for a response rate of 90.6%. This
included 904 SR agencies (94.7%) and 1,955 NSR
agencies (88.9%). The final database includes
responses from 1,947 local police departments, 
863 sheriffs' offices, and the 49 primary State 
law enforcement agencies. The overall response 
rate for local police departments was 92.1%, for 
sheriffs' offices 87.0%, and for the State law 
enforcement agencies, 100%.

The base weight for all SR agencies is one. 
For NSR sheriffs' offices, it is four. For NSR 
local police departments, the base weights are 
determined by number of sworn personnel employed 
as reported in the 2000 BJS Census of State and 
Local Law Enforcement Agencies. For agencies with 
0 to 6 sworn officers, the base weight is 15.55; 
for 7 to 13 officers, 9.65; for 14 to 23 officers, 
7.09; for 24 to 39 officers, 4.95; for 40 to 62
officers, 3.38; and for 63 to 99 officers, the 
base weight is 2.14.

The final weight associated with every agency, 
both SR and NSR, is the product of the base weight, 
a factor that adjusted for changes in the universe 
since 2000, and a factor that adjusted for any 
nonresponding agencies in each cell.  

The final weight for all SR local police agencies 
is 1.034234, for SR sheriffs' offices it is 
1.106667, and for the 49 primary State law 
enforcement agencies, it is 1. For NSR sheriffs' 
offices the final weight is 4.847247. For
NSR local police departments, the final weights 
are as follows: agencies with 0 to 6 sworn 
officers, 20.355930; 7 to 13 officers, 
10.925000; 14 to 23 officers, 7.707424; 24
to 39 officers, 5.313808; 40 to 62 officers, 
3.555024; and 63 to 99 officers, 2.216080.

Some responding agencies did not fully complete 
the LEMAS questionnaire. When an agency did not 
supply a response to an item, hot deck imputation, 
median value imputation, or ratio imputation was 
used. Hot deck imputation uses the value reported 
by a randomly selected agency from the same sample 
cell. Median value imputation uses the median value 
of an item reported by agencies in the same sample 
cell. Ratio imputation uses the median value of a 
ratio reported by agencies in the same sample cell.

Because the data from agencies with fewer than 100
sworn personnel were collected from a sample, the
results are subject to sampling error. The survey 
data are also subject to response and processing 
errors.
