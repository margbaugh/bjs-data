During 2005 the total Federal, State, and local adult
correctional population -- incarcerated or in the 
community -- grew by 60,800 to over 7 million. The growth
of 0.9% during the year was less than half of the average 
annual increase of 2.5% since 1995. About 3.2% of the U.S. 
adult population, or 1 in every 32 adults, were incarcerated 
or on probation or parole at yearend 2005.

The probation population increased 0.5% in 2005 to reach
4,162,536 on December 31. This represented an increase of 
19,070 additional probationers, or the smallest increase 
in the last 26 years. The adult parole population reached 
a total of 784,408 on December 31, 2005. It grew 1.6%, or 
slightly more than the average annual increase of 1.4% 
since 1995.

Nearly 5 million persons on 
probation or parole

The number of adult men and women in the United States who
were being supervised on probation or parole at the end of 
2005 reached a new high of 4,946,944, up from 3,757,282 on
December 31, 1995. These data were collected in the 2005
Annual Probation Survey and the 2005 Annual Parole Survey, 
conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).

Probationers are criminal offenders who have been sentenced
to a period of correctional supervision in the community in 
lieu of incarceration. Parole is a period of conditional
supervised release following a prison term. Prisoners may 
be released to parole either by a parole board decision or 
by mandatory conditional release.

In 2005 the growth in the combined probation and parole
populations was 0.6%. An additional 31,626 probationers or 
parolees were added during the year.

Probationers accounted for half the 
growth in the correctional 
population since 1990

Probationers accounted for more than half the total growth 
in the correctional population since 1990. Overall, the 
correctional population increased by nearly 2.5 million, or 
57%, from 1990 to 2005. Probationers accounted for 53% of 
the growth (or 1,492,000), followed by prisoners (25%, or 
703,000), jail inmates (12% or 342,000), and parolees (9% 
or 253,000).

Community supervision declined as 
a percentage of the correctional 
population

Between 1990 and 2005 the prison population was the fastest
growing correctional population, with an average annual 
increase of 4.5%, followed by jails (4.2%), and parole and 
probation (2.6% each).

As a percentage of the correctional population, offenders
under community supervision accounted for 69% of the 
correctional population in 2005 (down from nearly 74% in 
1990), while those incarcerated accounted for 31%(up from 
26% in 1990). 

Probationers continued to account for the majority of all
persons under correctional supervision in 2005 (58%, down 
from 61% in 1990). Parolees were 11% of the total population 
in 2005 (down from 12% in 1990). Prisoners increased to 20% 
of the total correctional population (up from 17% in 1990), 
while jail inmates increased to 10% (up from 9% in 1990).

Correctional supervision rate rose 
sharply from 1980 to 2005

The rate of U.S. adult residents under correctional
supervision nearly tripled between 1980 (1,117 per 100,000) 
and 2005 (3,150 per 100,000). During 2005 the U.S. resident 
population increased at a higher rate (1.1%) than the 
population under correctional supervision (0.9%). Despite 
growth in the total correctional population from 6,995,200 
in 2004 to 7,056,000 in 2005, the rate of U.S. men and 
women under correctional supervision in 2005 (3,150 per 
100,000 adult residents) remained about the same as in 2004 
(3,156).

6 of the 10 States with largest 
probation populations also had 
large parole populations 

Texas, California, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and 
Illinois had 6 of the 10 largest probation populations in 
the Nation at yearend 2005. These 6 States accounted for 
more than a third of all probationers (37%). The same 6 
States were among the 10 States with the largest parole 
populations in the Nation. Almost half of all parolees
were supervised within these 6 States (46%).

Texas and California accounted for more than 1 million 
adults supervised in the community, or about 1 in 5 
probationers and parolees. Each State had at least a half 
million adults on probation or parole: Texas with 532,228, 
and California with 500,003. 

Among the other States, Massachusetts had the largest
percentage of its adult population under community 
supervision (3.4% at yearend 2005), followed by Texas 
(3.2%) and Rhode Island (3.1%). 

California had the largest parole population and the second
largest probation population in the Nation. The percentage 
of California's adult population under community supervision 
was 1.9%, or slightly below the Nation's percentage of 2.2%.

Eight States reported rates of community supervision below
1,000 per 100,000 adult residents. New Hampshire had the 
lowest rate of supervision in the community (595 offenders 
per 100,000 adults).

9 States reported an increase of 5% 
or more in their probation 
population 

In 2005 Mississippi (up 17%) had the largest increase in 
probationers, followed by West Virginia (up 10%), and 
Wyoming (up 9%). A total of 32 States reported an increase 
in their adult probation population during 2005. 

Fifteen States had fewer adults on probation at the end of 
2005 than at the beginning of the year. Maine(down 9%)led 
the Nation with the largest decrease, followed by Vermont 
(down 8%), and Washington (down 6%).

19,070 probationers added in 2005

During 2005 the probation population grew by 19,070. The
growth in the number of probationers (0.5%) was the 
smallest growth in probation since the survey began in 
1980. 

At yearend 2005 the probation supervision rate totaled 
1,858 probationers per 100,000 adult U.S. residents--the 
equivalent of 1 in every 54 adults. Two States, 
Massachusetts (3,350 per 100,000)and Rhode Island(3,091 
per 100,000), had more than 3% of their adult resident
population under probation supervision.

A total of 10 States had fewer than 1% of their adult
resident population under probation supervision. One 
State, New Hampshire(457 per 100,000), had a rate below 
500 probationers per 100,000 adult residents.

Small growth in probation 
population during 2005

Since 2001 the growth in probation has steadily dropped. 
The annual change was 2.8% in 2001, 2.3% in 2002, 1.2% in 
2003, and 0.6% in 2004.

The 0.5% growth in the probation population during 2005 was
the smallest in the last 26 years.***Since Probation and 
Parole in the United States, 2004, was published, Washington 
State revised their 2004 data which resulted in the 2003-04 
national percent change increasing from 0.2% to 0.6%.***

Growth in probation since 1990 
linked to entries

Since 1990 the probation population has steadily increased
from 2,670,200 to 4,162,536 in 2005. Although the number of 
entries decreased from 1990 (1,637,600) to 1994 (1,397,500),
entries exceeded exits during that period, resulting in an
average annual increase of 3.0% in the probation population. 
The number entering probation has increased each year since 
1994, except for a 2.0% decrease in 2001 and a 0.5% decrease 
in 2004.
 
From 1995 through 1999 the annual increase in the probation
population fluctuated between 87,000 and 120,000 additional 
probationers each year. Beginning in 2001 the annual
increase in the number of probationers declined from 105,500
to 92,300 in 2002, to 49,900 in 2003, to 23,400 in 2004. In 
2005 the annual increase reached its lowest since data 
collection began in 1980--an additional 19,070 probationers.

5 States accounted for nearly a third 
of the growth in probation from 
1995 to 2005

In absolute numbers the probation population increased by
858,500 between 1995 and 2005. California experienced the 
largest growth 107,700), followed by Pennsylvania(60,700),
Michigan(37,200), Illinois(33,600), and Minnesota(33,300).
These five States accounted for 32% of the growth in 
probation since 1995.

Between 1995 and 2005 New York had the largest decrease in
the number of probationers(49,000), followed by Washington 
(16,200), and the Federal system (8,700).

------------------------------------------------
At yearend 2005 almost 1 in 4 probationers were
female; more than 1 in 2 were white

Nationwide women represented a slightly larger percentage 
of the probation population in 2005 than in 1995. Women 
were 23% of adults on probation in 2005 (956,200), up 
from 21% in 1995.

At yearend 2005 more than half of all probationers were 
white (2,290,500); almost a third were black (1,239,600); 
and an eighth were Hispanic (539,700). Persons of other 
races comprised about 2% of probationers (92,600).

Direct sentences more common in 2005 than 1995

A larger percentage of probationers in 2005 had received a 
direct sentence to probation (57%) than in 1995 (48%). A 
smaller percentage had a probation sentence combined with 
incarceration (10% compared to 15% in 1995). The percentage 
of probationers that received a suspended sentence to 
incarceration has slowly declined, from 26% in 1995 to 22% 
in 2005.

Half of all probationers convicted of a felony 

Probationers convicted of a felony (50%) accounted for a 
larger percentage of the population than probationers 
convicted of a misdemeanor (49%). About 1% of probationers 
had been convicted of other infractions.  

The largest percentage of the probation population was 
convicted of a drug law violation (28%), followed by a 
DWI (15%) and larceny/theft (12%).

Seven in 10 probationers were under active supervision at 
yearend. Probationers under active supervision are required 
to regularly report to a probation authority in person, by 
mail, or by telephone. The percentage of probationers 
required to report regularly declined steadily, from 79% in 
1995 to 70% in 2005.

About 1 in 10 persons still on probation had absconded at 
yearend 2005. Though still on probation, absconders had 
failed to report and could not be located. The percentage 
of absconders on probation increased slightly in the last 
10 years (10% in 2005, up from 9% in 1995).

Success rates have remained stable since 1995

Fifty-nine percent of the more than 2.2 million adults 
discharged from probation in 2005 had successfully met 
the conditions of their supervision. The percentage of 
probationers discharged successfully has varied between 
62% (1995) and 59% (2005). Probationers discharged from 
supervision because of incarceration due to a new offense 
or rule violation has varied, from 21% in 1995 to 15% in 
2000 to 16% in 2005. Another 3% of those discharged from 
probation had absconded and 13% had their probation 
revoked without incarceration.
------------------------------------------------

Parole population grew by 12,556 
during 2005

At the end of 2005 a total of 784,408 adult men and women
were on parole or mandatory conditional release following 
a prison term. The population grew by 12,556 parolees
during the year, or 1.6%. This was greater than the 
average annual increase of 1.4% since 1995. 

At yearend 2005, 350 persons were under parole supervision
per 100,000 adult residents, or 1 in every 286 adults in 
the United States. Pennsylvania (787 per 100,000), Arkansas 
(782), and Oregon (766) had the highest rates of parole 
supervision. Maine, which abolished parole in 1975, had the 
lowest rate of supervision (3 per 100,000). 

Parole populations increased in 33 
States

At total of 33 States and the District of Columbia had 
more adults on parole at the end of 2005 than at the 
beginning of the year. Double-digit increases were reported 
in 11 States. Arkansas (up 23%) had the largest increase, 
followed by North Dakota(up 17%), and West Virginia(up 16%). 

A total of 14 States reported a decrease in their parole
population during 2005. Nebraska (down 17%) had the only 
double-digit decrease. Four States had decreases of 5% or 
more: Hawaii (down 8%), Oklahoma and Massachusetts (both 
down 7%), and Alabama (down 6%).

State parole population increasing 
after stability during the 1990s

From 1980 to 1992 the State parole population increased 
from 196,800 to 618,700, or an average of 10% annually. 
From 1992 to 1998, the growth in the population slowed, 
increasing a total of 10,500 or the equivalent of an 
average annual increase of nearly 0.3%. In the following
period, 1998 to 2005, the State parole population added
64,000 parolees, or 1.4% annually.

Growth in State parole linked to 
entries

From 1980 to 1990 the number of entries to State parole
supervision more than tripled, from 113,400 to 349,000. 
State parole entries continued to rise during the 1990s 
(up an average of 2.4% annually). Parole discharges also 
increased during the period (up an average of 4.6%
annually).

From 2000 to 2005 the number of State parole entries
continued to exceed the number of exits. Both rose 
slowly, 1.7% annually.

Discretionary releases to parole 
supervision continued to decline

As a percentage of all releases from State prison,
discretionary releases by a parole board steadily
declined from 55% in 1980 to 22% in 2004. From
1980 to 1995 mandatory parole releases increased 
(from 19% to 39%). 

Mandatory releases remained fairly stable between 1995 
and 2004 (39%). These trends were consistent with the 
change in release policy occurring within many States 
after 1980, resulting in a shift away from discretionary 
releases in favor of determinate sentences and mandatory
supervised release. (See Trends in State Parole, 1990-
2000, October 2001, NCJ 184735.)

Releases from State prison due to expiration of sentence
increased from 13% of all releases in 1990 to 21% in 2001. 
Between 2001 and 2004 expiration of sentence releases 
declined to 19%. 

From 1990(5%)through 1999(6%)releases to probation
remained stable. Since 2000 releases to probation have 
steadily increased from 6% to 10% in 2004.

Other conditional releases have fluctuated over the years 
(3% in 1980, up to 10% in 1990, down to 6% in 2000). 
Since 2001 (3%) other conditional releases have steadily 
increased, reaching 6% in 2004. 

Proportion of females on parole 
increased between 1995 and 2005 

At yearend 2005 women made up about 1 in 8 adults on parole
(93,000). A greater percentage of women were on parole at 
the end of 2005 (12%), compared to 1995 (10%).

As a percentage of all parolees, blacks decreased from 45% 
in 1995 down to 40% in 2005. During this same period, the 
percentage of parolees who were white steadily increased
(34% in 1995, 38% in 2000, and 41% in 2005).

Almost 1 in 5 parolees were Hispanic (141,100). About 2% 
of parolees were of other races (12,700).

More than 8 in 10 parolees were 
under active supervision 

Active supervision requires parolees to regularly report 
to a parole authority in person, by mail, or by telephone. 
This type of supervision increased as a percentage of all 
parolees, from 78% in 1995 to 83% in 2000. In 2005 the 
percentage of parolees on active supervision(83%)remained
stable. 

Parolees on inactive status, excluded from regular 
reporting but still on parole, decreased as a percentage 
of all parolees, from 11% in 1995 to 4% in 2005. Another 
7% of all parolees still on parole in 2005 had absconded, 
4% were supervised out of State, and 1% were supervised 
through some other type of status.

About 4 in 10 parolees served a 
sentence for a drug offense

About 94% of all parolees had been sentenced to 1 year 
or more in State or Federal prison at yearend 2005. The 
largest percentage of parolees had been convicted of a 
drug offense (37%, down from 40% in 2002). 

Since 2002 the percentage of parolees supervised for 
property(26%)and violent(24%)offenses remained stable. 
An equal percentage of parolees were supervised for 
property (25%) and violent offenses (25%) at yearend 
2005. 

In 2005, 7% of parolees had been convicted of other 
offenses, such as public order violations or
unclassified offenses, up from 10% in 2002.

Rates of success for parolees have 
remained stable since 1995

As a percentage of all discharges, parolees who successfully
met the conditions of their supervision have remained nearly 
stable between 1995 and 2005(45% in both years). During this 
period the success rates for parolees were consistently lower 
than the success rates for probationers (62% in 1995 and 59% 
in 2005).

Since 1995 the total estimated number of parolees discharged
from supervision increased from 391,300 to 503,800 in 2005. 
During this time the number of successful exits increased 
from 176,300 to 227,600.

In 2005, 191,800 parolees were discharged from supervision
and returned to incarceration because of a new offense or 
rule violation, up from 160,000 in 1995. While the number 
of parolees returned to incarceration increased, the 
percentage of all exits resulting in re-incarceration 
remained nearly stable (41% in 1995 and 38% in 2005).

Methodology

The Annual Probation Survey and Annual Parole Survey provide
a count of the total number of persons supervised in the 
community on January 1 and December 31, 2005, and a count 
of the number entering and leaving supervision during the 
year. These surveys cover all 50 States, the District of 
Columbia, and the Federal system. The first annual report 
on probation and parole was released in 1979.

Data for the Federal system are from the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts as provided to the BJS Federal 
Justice Statistics Program.

Because many States update their population counts, the
January 1, 2005, numbers may differ from those previously 
published for December 31, 2004.

Probation  

The 2005 Annual Probation Survey was sent to 466 respondents  
33 central State reporters, the District of Columbia, the 
Federal system, and 431 separate State, county, or court 
agencies. States with multiple reporters were Alabama (3), 
Arizona(2), Colorado(8), Florida(43), Georgia(5),Idaho(2), 
Kentucky (3), Michigan (127), Missouri (2), Montana (4), 
New Mexico (2), Ohio (185), Oklahoma (3), Pennsylvania (2), 
Tennessee (3), Washington (35), and West Virginia (2). 

Since 1995 the survey coverage has been expanded to include
180 additional agencies. At yearend 2005, 226,192 
probationers were under the supervision of these agencies. 

Parole  

The 2005 Annual Parole Survey was sent to 54 respondents,
including 50 State central reporters, the District of 
Columbia, the Federal system, the California Youth 
Authority, and 1 municipal agency in Alabama.

Federal parole as defined here includes supervised release,
parole, military parole, special parole, and mandatory 
release.
