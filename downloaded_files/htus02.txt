Following a sharp increase in the late 1980's, the homicide rate fell
dramatically after 1991. Since 1999 the rate has stabilized. The Nation's
murder rate was 5.6 per 100,000 population in 2001 and 2002, similar to 
the rates seen in the late 1960's.

These findings and many more are from Homicide Trends in the United States, 
a section of the BJS web site that describes homicide patterns and trends 
in the United States since 1976. The site displays over 50 graphics and
supporting tables updated with the 2001 and 2002 data. Homicide is of 
interest not only because of its severity but also because it is considered 
by experts to be a fairly reliable barometer of violent crime. At the 
national level no other crime is measured as accurately and precisely.
 
For teens and young adults, homicide victimization rates increased in the 
late 1980's but fell sharply after 1993. During the same period rates for
older people declined. Adults ages 25-34 were the only group to experience
increases in victimization rates since the late 1990's. Offending rates 
show a similar pattern.

The homicide rates for teens reflect a reversal from the dramatic increases 
in the late 1980's and early 1990's. From 1976 to 1985, the rates for young
teens (ages 14-17) were below those for all older age groups. After 1985 
they rose to exceed the rates for persons age 35 or older. They have now
fallen back to levels below those of persons ages 35-49 -- levels similar to
those from 1976 to 1985 -- reversing the trend.

The sharp increase in homicides in the late 1980's and much of the subsequent
decline were attributable to a rise and fall in gun violence by teens and
young adults. Despite the moderation since 1993, the levels of gun homicides
by teens and young adults remain above those of the mid-1980's.

Other major findings--  

Gender
In 2002 males were most often the victims and the perpetrators in homicides:
males were 10 times more likely than females to commit murder, and male and
female offenders were more likely to target male than female victims.

Race
Blacks were 6 times more likely to be homicide victims and 7 times more 
likely than whites to commit homicides in 2002.

During the study period 1976-2002, 86% of white murder victims were killed 
by whites, and 94% of black victims were killed by blacks.

Among homicides in which the victim was killed by an acquaintance, 1 in
10 were interracial, whereas when the killer is a stranger, 3 in 10 were
interracial.

Age, race, and gender 
There were large increases in both homicide victimization and offending 
rates among young black males in the late 1980's and 1990's before 
declines and stabilization in both measures.

After increases in the late 1980's and early 1990's, 14-17 year olds in all
racial and gender groups experienced homicide offending rates in 2002 that
were lower than the levels recorded in 1976. Young adults (ages 18-24)
continue to have the highest offending rates in each racial and gender 
group.  Although much lower than the offending rates experienced in the 
late 1980's and early 1990's, rates for black and white males ages 18-24
remain higher in 2002 than in the mid 1980's. 

Infanticide
The number of infanticides (victims under age 5) has grown roughly in
proportion to the number of young children in the population, with most
perpetrators being a parent.

Eldercide
The number of homicides of persons age 65 and older has been decreasing. Yet
among all age groups, the elderly have the highest percentage of homicides
that occur during the commission of a felony.

Law enforcement officers killed
From 1976 to 2002 the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line 
of duty declined, mostly related to the decline in law enforcement officers
killed with handguns.

Multiple victims and offenders
Few homicides involve multiple offenders, and fewer involve multiple victims.
The percentage of homicides involving multiple offenders increased in the 
late 1980's and early 1990's, from 11.5% in 1976 to almost 19% in 2002. The
percentage of homicides involving multiple victims increased gradually from
about 3% of all homicides in 1976 to almost 5% in 2002. 

Intimate homicide
There has been a decline in homicide of intimates, especially male victims.
The number of intimate homicides declined over the period; black males 
killed by intimates dropped 81%, white males by 56%, black females by 49%, 
and white females by 9%.

Circumstances
The mix of circumstances surrounding homicides has changed over the last two
decades. Although the number of homicides resulting from arguments has
declined, arguments remain the most frequently cited circumstance among 
those that were known.

City size
In 2002 the homicide victimization rate for cities with a population
of 1 million or more reached the lowest level recorded since 1976.

Most of the swings in the prevalence of homicide during the past two decades
occurred in large cities (population of 100,000 or more) and in suburbs. 
Small cities and rural areas experienced relatively little change in 
homicide prevalence. 

Region
Compared to the national average, homicide rates, especially those involving
guns, were higher in the South and lower in the New England, Mountain, and
West North Central regions of the United States.

Clearances
The number of homicides cleared generally by arrest of the perpetrator
declined until 2001: 62% of all homicides were cleared in 2001 compared to 
79% in 1976. It increased to 64% in 2002.

Justifiable homicides -- NEW SECTION!
Most justifiable homicides by police are the result of attacks on officers. 
The most frequent circumstance cited for justifiable homicides by citizens 
is to disrupt a crime while in progress.
