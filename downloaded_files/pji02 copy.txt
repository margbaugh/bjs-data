At midyear 2002, 665,475 persons were held in local jails: over half had
been convicted; a quarter were detained awaiting arraignment or trial; and
a sixth were held on a prior sentence but also awaiting arraignment or trial
on a new charge. These findings are based on information from personal
interviews with a national sample of nearly 7,000 jail inmates, conducted
January through April 2002.

The survey provides a profile of offenders held in local jails and a
comparison to those held in 1996 when the last survey was conducted.

Based on the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (SILJ),  the number of 
inmates held for drug law violations totaled 156,000, up from 114,100 in
1996. The increase in drug offenders accounted for 37% of the growth in
the nation's jail population. Overall, at midyear 2002 the distribution of
jail
inmates by type of offense remained nearly unchanged: a fourth of inmates
in each of four major categories   violent, property, drug, or public-order. 


Two-thirds of jail inmates in 2002 said they were regular drug users; over
half of the convicted inmates reported using drugs in the month before
their current offense. An estimated 66% of jail inmates reported using
alcohol at least once a week for a month; 33% were under the influence of
alcohol at the time of the current offense. Together, 77% of convicted jail
inmates were alcohol or drug-involved at the time of their current offense.

----------------------------------------

More than 6 in 10 jail inmates were racial or ethnic minorities, unchanged
since 1996

As defined in this report, jails are locally operated correctional facilities
that confine persons before or after adjudication. Inmates sentenced to jail
usually have a sentence of a year or less, but jails also incarcerate persons
in a wide variety of other categories.

In each year, about 6 in 10 jail inmates were racial or ethnic minorities
(table 1). In 2002 blacks made up 40% of the jail inmate population;
Hispanics, 19%; and whites, 36%. The decline in American Indian/Alaska
Native inmates to 1.4% in 2002 from 2.4% in 1996, may reflect the change
in the data collection method in 2002 that allowed inmates to 
select more than one racial category. 
Female inmates made up almost 12% of the local jail inmate population in
2002, up from 10% in 1996. 

The jail population was older in 2002 than in 1996. About 38% of jail
inmates were age 35 or older, up from 32% in 1996.

An estimated 8% of jail inmates were not U.S. citizens, unchanged from
1996. 

Jails --

* receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them awaiting trial,
conviction, or sentencing
* readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and absconders
* temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to juvenile authorities
* hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to appropriate health
facilities
* hold individuals for the military, for protective custody, for contempt,
and for the courts as witnesses                                     
* release convicted inmates to the community upon completion of
sentence
* transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other authorities  
* house inmates for Federal, State, or other authorities because of
crowding of their facilities
* sometimes operate community-based programs as alternatives to
incarceration       
* hold inmates sentenced to short terms (generally under 1 year).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Over half of all jail inmates  convicted of current or prior charges only

In 2002 an estimated 37% of all jail inmates were convicted of the offense
that led to their most recent admission to jail, unchanged from 1996 (table
2). About 18% in 2002 were convicted of prior charges for which they
were on probation or parole, compared to 11% in 1996.

Among unconvicted jail inmates in 2002, 17% were on trial or awaiting
trial. Around 11% were awaiting arraignment or a revocation hearing of a
prior release status (such as bail/bond, electronic monitoring, house arrest,
day/weekend reporting, work/study release, or furlough). An estimated
16% of all inmates were both unconvicted (on current arrest offenses) and
convicted (on a prior offense). 

About 43% of jail inmates in 2002 reported they were sentenced to serve
time in jail or prison or were awaiting sentencing. Just under 10% said
they were awaiting sentencing for an offense.

Minor changes in the offenses for which inmates were being held

Overall, the offense composition of the jail population changed slightly
between 1996 and 2002 (table 3). The percentage of inmates held for drug
offenses increased to 25% in 2002 from 22% in 1996, driven by drug
trafficking which rose to 12% from 9%. 

The percent of jail inmates held for property offenses declined from 27%
in 1996 to 24% in 2002. Violent and public-order offenses were relatively
unchanged at around 25% in 1996 and 2002. 

Among unconvicted inmates, 34% had a violent offense as the most
serious charge, while 23% had drug offenses. About 29% of convicted
inmates were public-order offenders; 25% were property offenders; and
24% were drug offenders.  

Among jail inmates who were both convicted and unconvicted, 30% had a 
drug offense as their most serious conviction offense; 27% had a property
offense; 22% a violent offense; and 19% a public-order offense.

Drug trafficking (12.1%) was the most common offense among jail
inmates, followed by assault (11.7%) and drug possession (10.8%).

Over 6% of jail inmates in 2002 were held for burglary, larceny/theft, or
driving while intoxicated.  

Although 46% of all jail inmates were on probation or parole at the time of
their arrest, about  3% reported a probation or parole violation as their
most serious charge.

In absolute numbers, drug and public- order offenders accounted for most
of the growth in the jail population between 1996 and 2002. Drug
offenders in local jails rose by 41,800 and public-order offenders by
30,700, accounting for 64% of the increase in the jail population. Violent
offenders (up 24,000) accounted for a fifth of the overall growth.

An increasing percentage of female inmates had violent offenses

An increasing percentage of female inmates had violent offenses as their
most serious charge, 17% in 2002, up from 15% in 1996 and 13% in 1989.
Still, compared to male inmates (27%) in 2002, female jail inmates were
less likely to be violent offenders (table 4).

Female jail inmates were more likely than males to be drug offenders. An
estimated 29% of female and 24% of male inmates were drug offenders in
2002. A larger percentage of women were in jail for drug possession
(15%) than for trafficking (11%), while the distribution for men was
reversed, drug trafficking (12%) and possession (10%).

The most serious offense of jail inmates varied among white, black, and
Hispanic inmates. In 2002 black inmates (31%) were more likely to be in
jail for drug offenses than white inmates (19%) and Hispanic inmates
(28%). Drug trafficking made up a larger percentage of the drug offenses
for blacks (16%) and Hispanic (14%) inmates, than for whites (9%).

Black and Hispanic inmates (27%) were also more likely to be violent
offenders than white inmates (22%). White inmates (31%) were more 
likely to be in jail for public-order offenses, particularly DWI, 
than black (18%) and Hispanic inmates (28%). White (11%) and Hispanic 
(8%) inmates were over 4 times more likely to be in jail for DWI than 
black inmates (2%). 

Nearly a quarter of jail inmates had been held for 14 days or less at the
time of the interview

Nearly a quarter (23%) of all jail inmates had been in jail for 14 days or
less at the time of the interview (table 5). Twenty-nine percent had been
held from 2 to 6 months, while 7% had been held for a year or more.

An estimated 30% of convicted jail inmates had been in jail from 2 to 6
months, compared to 25% of unconvicted inmates. A larger percentage of
convicted inmates (8%) than unconvicted inmates (5%) had been in jail for
more than a year. 

Regardless of detention status, nonviolent offenders had spent less time in
jail than violent offenders. About 40% of nonviolent offenders had been in
jail a month or less, compared to 31% of violent offenders. Violent
offenders (11%) were twice as likely as nonviolent offenders (5%) to have
been in jail for a year or more.

About three-quarters of sentenced  inmates to serve time in local jail 

Jail inmates who were sentenced to serve time, either for a prior or current
offense, were asked if they expected to serve their time in a jail, prison,
juvenile facility, or other type of facility. Of the estimated 271,000
sentenced jail inmates, 73% expected to serve their sentence in jail, 24%
in State or Federal prison, and 4% elsewhere.

Among inmates who will serve their sentence in jail, a third were
public-order offenders. About a fourth were property offenders, and a fifth
each were violent or drug offenders.

Half the inmates sentenced to jail in 2002 had a term of 8 months or less,
expecting to serve 5 months or less 

The average maximum sentence length for inmates who were to serve their
time in jail was an estimated 24 months in 2002, up from 23 months in
1996 (table 6). Though stable overall, the average sentence length for
violent offenders dropped from 36 months to 33 months; for property
offenders, from 26 to 23 months; and for public-order offenders, from 13
to 10 months.

The average sentence for drug offenders was 35 months in 2002, up 11
months from 1996. This change was due to an increase for drug
trafficking, from 29 to 50 months.

In 2002 inmates sentenced to serve time in jail expected to serve an
average of 9 months before their release, down from 10 months in 1996.
Time expected to be served by violent inmates dropped to 14 months in
2002 from 16 months in 1996.  Property offenders expected to serve 9
months, down from 11 months, and drug offenders, 11 months, down from
13 months. 

A third of jail inmates were on probation at the time of arrest

More than half of jail inmates reported having a pre-existing criminal
justice status at the time of arrest, unchanged from 1996. The percent of
inmates on probation increased from 32% to 34%, while the percent out on
bail or bond dropped from 13% to 7% (table 7).

Over half of jail inmates who were on probation or parole at the time of
arrest were drug or property offenders. A fifth of each group had a violent
offense. 

An estimated 26% of those on probation and 31% on parole said their
release had been revoked because of an arrest or conviction for a new
offense. Approximately 17% reported drug-related violations as the reason
for revocation of release.


24% of jail inmates had 3 or more prior incarcerations in 2002, down from
32% in 1996

In 1996 and 2002 approximately 27% of jail inmates reported they had no
prior sentences to probation or incarceration, and nearly 18% said they had
one prior sentence (table 8). During this period, the percent reporting they
had served two prior sentences rose (from 11% to 17%), while the percent
reporting three or more prior sentences declined (from 44% to 39%). 

While 42% of inmates in 1996 and 2002 reported no prior sentence to
incarceration, nearly 24% in 2002 responded that they had served one prior
sentence to incarceration, compared to 18% among inmates surveyed in
1996. The percentage of jail inmates who had served three or more prior
sentences to incarceration dropped to 24% in 2002, down from 32% in
1996.

The number of prior sentences to probation remained stable between 1996
and 2002. Nearly 4 in 10 had no prior sentence to probation. Just over 
3 in 10 jail inmates in 2002 had served one prior sentence to probation;
just under 3 in 10 had served two or more prior sentences to probation.

Hispanic inmates were less likely to have served a sentence to
incarceration or probation than white or black inmates. Forty-nine percent
of Hispanic inmates had no prior sentence, com- pared to 43% of black
inmates and 39% of white inmates. 

41% of jail inmates had a current or past violent offense; 13% a current or
past drug offense only

An estimated 41% of jail inmates in 2002 had a current or prior sentence
for a violent offense (table 9). About 46% were nonviolent offenders with
property, drug, or public-order as their current and prior offenses. Thirteen
percent had only current or past drug offenses.

The prior offense history of jail inmates varied by conviction status,
gender, and race. Nearly half of unconvicted jail inmates were current or
violent recidivists versus over a third of convicted inmates in 2002. 
 
Male inmates (43%) were more likely than females (27%) to have a
current or prior violent offense (table 10). Women (18%) were more likely
than men (13%) to have current or past drug offenses in 2002. 

Black inmates were more likely to be violent recidivists (30%) than white
inmates (27%) or Hispanic inmates (24%) in 2002. Among inmates with 
no previous conviction, about 15% of Hispanic inmates had a current
violent offense, followed by black inmates at 14%, and whites, at 11%. An
estimated 9% of white inmates had past or current drug offenses only,
compared to 17% of black and 17% of Hispanic inmates. 

More than 6 in 10 jail inmates reported regular use of alcohol 

Two-thirds of jail inmates reported regular use of alcohol in 2002,
unchanged since 1996. Regular use was defined as ever drinking
alcohol at least once a week for at least a month. (The definition of regular
use includes drinking daily or drinking at least once a week during the year
before the offense for which inmates were admitted to jail.)

Only convicted inmates were asked about alcohol or drug use at the time
of the offense. Jail inmates who reported using alcohol at the time of the
offense dropped from 41% in 1996 to 33% in 2002.

About two-thirds of male inmates in 2002 said they regularly drank
alcohol, compared to over half of female inmates. More than a third of
convicted male inmates and under a quarter of convicted female inmates
had used alcohol at the time of the offense.

An estimated 39% of convicted white inmates reported alcohol use at the
time of the offense in 2002, down from 48% in 1996. Among convicted
black inmates, alcohol use at the time of offense dropped from 34% to
29%; and for convicted Hispanic inmates, from 38% to 301%. 

In 2002 jail inmates with violent (38%) or property (29%) offenses were more
likely to have used alcohol at the time of the offense than inmates with
public-order (26%)or drug (22%) offenses.
  
Regular drug use rose slightly between 1996 and 2002

The proportion of jail inmates who reported regular use of drugs increased
between 1996 and 2002. An estimated 69% said they used drugs regularly
or at least once a week for a month, up from 64% in 1996 (table 12). 

Marijuana (76%), cocaine or crack (48%), and hallucinogens (32%) were
the drugs reported most commonly ever used by jail inmates in 2002 and
in 1996. During the period, regular use of marijuana rose slightly (from
55% to 58%). Use of hallucinogens also rose (from 11% to 13%), while
regular use of other types of drugs remained relatively stable. 

In each year over half of convicted jail inmates reported drug use in the
month before the offense. In 2002, 38% of jail inmates reported use of
marijuana in the month before the offense; 21% reported use of cocaine or
crack; 11%, stimulants (including amphetamines and methamphetamines);
and 8%, heroin or other opiates. 

Overall, there was little change in the type of drugs used in the month
before the offense between 1996 and 2002.

An estimated 29% of convicted jail inmates reported using drugs at the
time of the offense, down from 35% in 1996. In 2002, 14% of jail inmates
said that they had used marijuana at the time of the offense, followed by
11% who said they had used cocaine or crack. In 1996, 18% of inmates
reported using marijuana, and 14%, cocaine or crack.

Alcohol or drug use at the time 
of the offense declined 

An estimated 50% of all convicted jail inmates reported that they had used
alcohol or drugs at the time of the offense in 2002, down from 59% who
reported being under the influence of a substance in 1996 (table 13). 

In 2002, 35% of jail inmates said they had used alcohol at the time of the
offense, down from 41% in 1996. Over a fourth of jail inmates reported
drug use at the time of the offense in 2002, down from a third in 1996.

The percentage of female jail inmates who said they had used alcohol or
drugs at the time of the offense dropped substantially from 58% in 1996 to
46% in 2002. Alcohol or drug use at the time of the offense as reported by
male inmates also dropped from 59% to 50%. 

About 77% of convicted jail inmates could be characterized as alcohol- or
drug-involved offenders in 2002, unchanged from 1996. 

Substance abuse treatment rose slightly between 1996 and 2002 

Participation in substance abuse treatment for jail inmates who reported
regular use of drugs or alcohol rose (from 50% to 58%) between 2002 and
1996 (table 14). However, participation among convicted jail inmates who
had used drugs or alcohol in the month before their current arrest was
unchanged at about 53%.

In 2002 an estimated 15% of regular users in the year before their arrest
said they had received treatment since their current admission to jail, a
slight increase from 12% in 1996. Self-help (10%) and education
awareness (5%) were the most common types of  programs inmates said
they had participated in since admission to jail. 

About 43% of regular drug or alcohol users in 2002 reported past
treatment while under correctional supervision (in jail or prison or on
probation or parole). About 34% of regular users in 1996 reported past
treatment. The increase may be due to reported past treatment while on
probation or parole which rose from 23% in 1996 to 31% in 2002. Past
treatment in prison or jail had a smaller increase from 25% to 29%.
 
Nearly a third of convicted jail inmates in 2002 who had used drugs or
alcohol in the month before their arrest said they had participated in a
treatment program while on probation or parole, up from over a quarter in
1996. Convicted inmates who said they had participated in treatment while
in prison or jail remained at 28%.

Over half of all jail inmates grew 
up in a single-parent household 
or with a guardian

Over half of jail inmates grew up in either a single-parent household or
with a guardian, such as grandparents, another relative, or a nonrelative
(table 15). Jail inmates who lived with a mother only dropped from 43% to
39% between 1996 and 2002. 

An estimated 12% of jail inmates in 2002, compared to 14% in 1996, said
they had lived in a foster home, agency, or institution while growing up.

In 2002, 31% of jail inmates said they grew up in households where a
parent or guardian abused alcohol or drugs, unchanged since 1996. Nearly
9% lived with parents who abused both alcohol and drugs.  

An estimated 46% of jail inmates in 2002 had a family member who had
been incarcerated in a prison or jail. About 31% had a brother; 19% a
father; 9% a sister; and 7% a mother who had been incarcerated. 

35% of jail inmates reported ever having been injured in an assault prior to
admission to jail

In 2002, for the first time, jail inmates were asked if they had ever suffered
an injury from an assault before their
current admission to jail. (See Methodology for a description.) More than a
third of all jail inmates said they had ever been injured in an assault (table
16). About 17% of jail inmates had been injured after they were adults, age
18 or older, and 8% said they had been injured before age 18.  

Around 37% of male jail inmates said they had sustained an injury
following an assault, compared to 16% of female inmates. A larger
percentage of female inmates (86%) than male inmates (68%) knew the
person who caused the injury. 

An estimated 62% of female inmates said an intimate partner   such as
(ex) spouse, (ex) girlfriend, or (ex) boyfriend   had caused the injury.
About 20% of male inmates said they were injured by an intimate partner.

Over 5% of female and 3% of male inmates said they had been injured by
a parent or guardian.

18% of jail inmates reported  physical 
or sexual abuse prior  to admission to jail
 
In 2002, 18% of all jail inmates said they had been physically or sexually
abused before their most recent admission to jail, a slight increase from
16% in 1996 (table 17). The percent of female inmates who said they had
been abused rose from 48% to 55%, while the distribution for male
inmates was unchanged at 13%.  

The overall increase in physical or sexual abuse among female inmates
may be attributable to those reporting physical abuse which rose from 37%
to 45% between 1996 and 2002. 

In 2002, 36% of female inmates reported they had been sexually abused in
the past. An estimated 4% of men reported sexual abuse prior to their
current jail admission.

Among jail inmates who had been abused, women (68%) were more likely
than men (11%) to have been abused by an intimate partner. Among
abused women, 26% said they had been physically or sexually abused  by
a parent or guardian, and 34% by a friend or acquaintance. Among abused
men, 60% had been physically or sexually abused by a parent or guardian,
and 14% by a friend or acquaintance.

Nearly a fifth of jail inmates had ever been under a restraining order 

In 2002, 19% of jail inmates had at some time been under a restraining
order or protection order (table 18). About 5% of all jail inmates had an
order in effect when they were admitted to jail. Fewer than 2% had a
formal violation charge among their current offenses.

Nearly 5% of jail inmates said they had violated a restraining order in the
past. Of jail inmates who had ever been under a restraining order,
three-quarters said the order was sought by an intimate. A fifth said a
nonrelative had obtained the order.


Methodology

The Survey of Inmates in Local Jails was conducted from January through
April, 2002. The sample for the survey was selected from a universe of
3,365 jails that were enumerated in the 1999 Census of Jails. The sample
design was a stratified two-stage selection, where jails were selected in the
first stage and inmates to be interviewed in the second stage. 

In the first stage, six separate strata were formed based on the size of the
male, female and juvenile (both male and female) populations. In two
strata all jails were selected   those jails housing only females and those
with more than 1,000 males or more than 50 females or both. In the
remaining four strata a systematic sample of jails was selected. Each jail
within a stratum had an equal probability of selection. Overall, 465 jails
were selected. Interviews were conducted in 417 jails; 39 refused or were
excluded for administrative reasons; and 9 were closed or had no inmates
to survey.

In the second sampling stage, interviewers from the Census Bureau visited
each selected facility and systematically selected a sample of male and
female inmates. The sample used a random start and a total number of
interviews based upon the size and sex of the facility. A total of  6,982
inmates were interviewed, and 768 refused to participate, for a second
stage nonresponse of 9.9%.  
 
The interviews, about an hour long, used computer-assisted personal
interviewing (CAPI). The computers provided questions for the
interviewer, including follow-up questions tailored to the preceding
answers. Before the interview, inmates were told verbally and in writing
that participation was voluntary and that all information provided would
be held in confidence.  

Based on the completed interviews, estimates for the entire jail population
were developed using weighting fac- tors derived from the original
probability of selection in the sample. These factors were adjusted for
variable rates of nonresponse across strata and inmate characteristics.
Further adjustments were made to control the survey estimates to counts of
jail inmates obtained from the 1999 Census of Jails and the 2001 Annual
Survey of Jails.

The accuracy of the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails depends on
sampling and measurement errors. Sampling errors occur by chance
because a sample rather than a complete enumeration of the population
was conducted. Measurement error can be attributed to many sources, such
as nonresponse, recall difficulties, differences in the interpretation of
questions among inmates, and data processing errors. 

The sampling error, as measured by an estimated standard error, varies by
the size of the estimate and the size of the base population. Estimates of
the standard errors for selected characteristics have been calculated for the
2002 Survey.  

Standard error tables are available in Appendix tables on the BJS Website
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/pji02.htm>.

In this report, the definition of a con- victed jail inmate differs from other
previously published reports. All available survey data were used to
classify inmates as convicted, unconvicted, or both convicted and
unconvicted. In the Annual Survey of Jails, administrators report the
detention status of the most serious offense and include probation and
parole violators with no new sentence among convicted inmates. Trend
comparisons between data in this report and reports based on data from
previous jail inmate surveys are affected by the revised definition of
convicted and unconvicted inmates. Other revisions to the questionnaire 
will also affect comparisons across surveys.

In the questionnaire, physical assault was defined as being pushed, grabbed,
slapped, kicked, bit, shoved, hit with a fist, beat up, choked, or having a
weapon
(such as a gun, knife, rock or other object) used against them. A physical
injury
was defined as knife wounds, gunshot wounds, broken bone, teeth knocked out
or chipped, internal injuries, knocked unconscious, bruises, black eye, cuts,
scratches, swelling, or welts.
