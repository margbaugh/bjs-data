---------------------------------------------------
Abuse of elderly victims age 65 or older can take
many forms, including physical abuse, sexual abuse,
emotional or psychological abuse, fi nancial or
material exploitation, neglect, and abandonment. While
a large scale eff ort to track these various forms of elder
abuse does not exist in the United States, data reported
to the FBI's National Incident-Based Reporting System
(NIBRS) can shed light on specifi c aspects of elder abuse
in many jurisdictions across the nation. Annually, NIBRS
compiles incident-based administrative data on all crimes
recorded by participating state and local law enforcement
agencies, including physical and sexual abuse of the elderly.
Th e NIBRS data capture a wide range of information on
the victims and off enders, as well as characteristics of the
incidents. Th e FBI acts as a central collection agent for
these data. While NIBRS is not yet national, sixteen states
submitted administrative data on all crimes known to law
enforcement agencies in 2012. (See Methodology.)

Because NIBRS data are not nationally representative, the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) focused on data from
Michigan, which was a complete reporting state from 2005
to 2009. Th is allowed BJS to demonstrate the capabilities of
NIBRS data when looking at the violent victimizations of
people age 65 or older. During this 5-year period, Michigan
law enforcement agencies that reported incident-based data
represented 95% or more of Michigan's population. As a
result of Michigan's complete reporting status, BJS was able
to produce population-based reported violent victimization
rates that compare the number of violent victimizations
known to law enforcement to the number of residents in
that state. The data detail violent victimization of people
age 65 or older who were victims of murder, non-negligent
manslaughter, forcible rape, violent sexual assault, robbery,
aggravated assault, kidnapping, and simple assault. Rates
in this report are expressed as the number of reported
violent victimizations per 100,000 Michigan residents. (See
Methodology for additional information on the NIBRS data
and the Michigan sample.)

Beyond recognizing the various types of crime to which the
elderly may be subjected, little is known about how often
these victimizations occur or the severity of the incidents.
Recent studies have measured the prevalence of various
forms of elder abuse; however, these studies acknowledge the
lack of available data on elder abuse and mistreatment while
noting the likely magnitude of the problem. Several research
studies have been conducted to provide a national estimate
of elder abuse and mistreatment, but no data collection has
been implemented that can supply a national source of data
measuring victimization trends over time. (See References
in Methodology for more information). This report
demonstrates the value of NIBRS data for examining violent
victimization of the elderly and provides a framework for
describing trends for two types of elder abuse--physical
violence and sexual abuse.

**********************************************
HIGHLIGHTS

* Half (49.5%) of violent victimizations of the elderly known
to law enforcement in Michigan involved serious violence--
murder, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault,
and kidnapping (figure 1).

* Three out of 10 elderly victims of reported violence were
victimized by their own child or grandchild.

* More than a third of violent victimizations of elderly
women (37.8%) involved the victim's child or grandchild,
compared to less than a quarter of victimizations of elderly
men (22.5%).

* The rate of reported violence against elderly men (247.7
per 100,000 males age 65 or older) was 1.4 times higher than
the rate for elderly women (172.9 per 100,000 women age
65 or older).

* The rate of reported violent victimization by a stranger
was more than 2 times greater for elderly men (65.5 per
100,000 males age 65 or older) than for elderly women (29.2
per 100,000 women age 65 or older.
*************************************************
---------------------------------------------------
Michigan residents age 65 or older had the lowest rate
of reported violent victimization compared to other
age groups
---------------------------------------------------
Nearly 824,000 violent victimizations came to the
attention of law enforcement in Michigan from 2005 to
2009. Victimizations of the elderly accounted for 1.6%
(or 13,220) of the total (not shown in a table). The rate 
of violent victimization known to law enforcement increased
dramatically for Michigan residents from childhood
to young adulthood, peaking between the ages of 18
and 24 (table 1). Thereafter, the rate of reported violent
victimization diminished greatly with age, regardless of sex
or race.

Elderly persons age 65 or older experienced the
lowest annual rate of personal violence--204.5 violent
victimizations per 100,000 persons in that age group. This
rate was based on violent crimes known to law enforcement.
Because not all violent crimes are reported to authorities,
the rate is an undercount of the total victimization rate.
Data from BJS's National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS),
which collects information directly from victims on both
reported and unreported victimizations, indicated that
from 2005 to 2009, 47.4% of nonfatal violent victimizations
(forcible rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault,
and simple assault) were reported to law enforcement.
Elderly victims reported a higher percentage (58.5%)
of nonfatal violent victimizations to law enforcement,
compared to other age groups (47.2%).

---------------------------------------------------
Elderly males had a higher rate of reported violent
victimization than elderly females
---------------------------------------------------

In Michigan, the annual rate of violence known to law
enforcement against elderly males (247.7 per 100,000 males
age 65 or older) was 1.4 times higher than the rate for
elderly females (172.9 per 100,000 females age 65 or older).

Rates of reported violent victimization in Michigan varied
by race and age group:

** Elderly whites (145.4 per 100,000 white persons age 65 or
older) and elderly Asians and Pacific Islanders (131.9 per
100,000 Asians and Pacific Islanders age 65 or older) were
victimized at a similar rate.

** Elderly blacks, who experienced the highest rate of
reported violence (744.9 per 100,000 black persons age
65 or older), experienced violent victimizations at 5 times
the rate of elderly whites or Asians and Pacific Islanders.

** The violent victimization rate for elderly American Indian
and Alaska Natives (239.6 per 100,000 American Indians
and Alaska Natives age 65 or older) was higher relative to
the rate for whites and Asians and Pacific Islanders.

** The victimization rate for persons ages 65 to 74 (244.1
per 100,000 residents ages 65 to 74) was about 1.5 times
greater than the rate for persons ages 75 to 84 (164.4
per 100,000) or age 85 or older (156.1 per 100,000) (not
shown in a table).

Some care should be taken when comparing victimization
rates within the elderly population, or between elderly
and nonelderly groups. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau
indicate that an estimated 14.0% of U.S. residents age 85 or
older resided in a skilled nursing facility or other
long-term care facility in 2009, compared to 1.2% of
residents ages 65 to 74 and 4.0% of residents ages 75 to 84
(not shown in table).***Footnote 1U.S. Census Bureau (2009).

Group Quarters Population by Group Quarters Type. Retrieved
from
http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/cats/population/househ
olds_families_group_quarters.html (table 73).*** Violent
offenses that occur in these facilities may be reported to
and investigated by authorities other than local law
enforcement. As a result, elder victimization captured by
NIBRS data is likely an undercount of the volume of such
crimes known to authorities in general.

---------------------------------------------------
Offenders who victimized the elderly tended to be
older than offenders who victimized younger persons
---------------------------------------------------

Offending rates were calculated to compare the likelihood
of elderly persons being victimized by an offender in one
particular demographic group compared to other age
groups. Information is based on the primary offender, or
the offender with the closest relationship to the victim
based on data known to law enforcement (see Metholodology.)
Offending rates are expressed as the average annual number
of reported violent victimizations of the elderly committed
by an offender subgroup (e.g., males) for every 100,000
individuals in the same demographic subgroup who resided
in Michigan during the 5-year study period.

Known offending rates against elderly victims in Michigan
varied by age, sex, and race:

** Males were more likely than females to victimize the
elderly. The rate of elderly victimizations involving male
offenders (48.5 victimizations per 100,000 males) was
3 times higher than the rate involving female offenders
(14.6 victimizations per 100,000 females) (table 2).

** Black offenders (104.4 victimizations per 100,000 blacks)
victimized the elderly at a rate 5 times higher than white
offenders (19.7 victimizations per 100,000 whites).

** Elderly victims were more likely to be victimized by
young adult offenders ages 18 to 24 than by offenders of
other ages.

Despite elderly victims experiencing a higher rate of
reported violence by offenders ages 18 to 24, offenders who
perpetrated violence against persons age 65 or older tended
to be older than offenders who perpetrated violence against
victims younger than 65. The mean age of offenders of
elderly victims was 39 years old, compared to the mean age
of 29 among offenders of younger victims (not shown in a
table).

** Elderly victims (27.0%) were more likely than other
victims (7.2%) to be victimized by an offender who was
age 50 or older (table 3).

** About 10.4% of elderly victims were victimized by a
juvenile offender, compared to 17.2% of younger victims.

**  A third (33.0%) of elderly victims were victimized by
offenders ages 18 to 34, compared to half (50.5%) of
younger victims.

**  Nearly 11.5% of violence against elderly victims was
allegedly perpetrated by offenders age 65 or older,
compared to less than 1% of younger victims.

---------------------------------------------------
The majority of reported violence against the elderly
was intraracial
---------------------------------------------------

Elderly victims of violent crime were more likely to be
victimized by offenders of the same race than by offenders of
a different race. In Michigan between 2005 and 2009, 85.1%
of reported violence against the elderly was intraracial (not
shown in a table). The majority of victimizations of elderly
whites were perpetrated by white offenders (79.6%), and
most victimizations of elderly blacks were perpetrated by
black offenders (95.8%).

---------------------------------------------------
Most violent crime against elderly victims involved
one offender and one victim
---------------------------------------------------

More than two-thirds (69.5%) of violence against elderly
victims known to law enforcement in Michigan was
perpetrated by one offender against one victim (table 4).
Overall, nearly 7 in 8 violent victimizations (86.9%) of a
single elderly victim involved a lone offender. One in 5
(20.0%) victimizations of the elderly involved multiple
victims (i.e., a victimization in which at least one of the
victims was age 65 or older). Of victimizations involving
multiple victims, about two-thirds (68.7%) were perpetrated
by a single offender, while the remaining third (31.3%)
involved two or more offenders.

3 out of 10 elderly victims of violent crime known to
law enforcement were abused by their own child or
grandchild

Half (49.7%) of elderly victims of reported violent crime
were victimized by a family member, such as intimate
partners (12.9%), the victim's own children (22.0%),
grandchildren (8.5%), or other relatives (6.3%) (table 5).
The offender was more likely to be a family member in
victimizations against an elderly female (60.0%) than an
elderly male (38.6%).

Among reported violent victimizations of the elderly, women
were more likely than men to be--

** victimized by a spouse or ex-spouse (12.4% of elderly
female victims compared to 7.4% of elderly male victims)

** victims of violence by their child (26.0% of elderly
female victims compared to 17.6% of elderly male victims)

** victims of violence by their grandchild (11.8% of elderly
female victims compared to 4.9% of elderly male victims).

An estimated 26.4% of elderly male victims were victimized
by a stranger, compared to 16.9% of elderly female victims.
Friends or acquaintances of the victim accounted for 35.0%
of offenders involved in violence against elderly male
victims, compared to 23.1% of violence against elderly
female victims.

---------------------------------------------------
The rate of violent victimization by a stranger was
more than 2 times greater for elderly males than
elderly females
---------------------------------------------------

The annual rate of violent victimization by a spouse or
ex-spouse in Michigan was higher among elderly females
(21.5 per 100,000 females age 65 or older) than elderly males
(18.4 per 100,000 males age 65 or older), while the rate of
victimization by a boyfriend or girlfriend was higher among
elderly males (8.4 per 100,000 males age 65 or older) than
elderly females (4.3 per 100,000 females age 65 or older)
(figure 2).

The annual rate of reported violent victimization by--

** the victim's child was similar for elderly males (43.6 per
100,000 males age 65 or older) and elderly females (45.0
per 100,000 females age 65 or older)

** a grandchild was 1.7 times greater for elderly females
(20.5 per 100,000 females age 65 or older) compared to
elderly males (12.2 per 100,000 males age 65 or older)

** a friend or acquaintance or a stranger was more than 2
times greater for elderly men than for elderly women.

---------------------------------------------------
Half of violent victimization of the elderly was serious
violence
---------------------------------------------------

Half of reported (50.5%) elderly victims of violence in
Michigan were victims of simple assault (figure 3). Another
18.0% were victims of aggravated assault and 28.0% were
robbery victims. The percentage of elderly victims who were
robbed was more than 3 times higher than the comparable
percentage for nonelderly victims. While murder and
manslaughter percentages were small, the proportion of
elderly victims who were murdered (1%) was 2 times greater
than the proportion of nonelderly victims.

****************************************************
---------------------------------------------------
NIBRS data were less likely to have identifying information
about the offender when the victim was elderly
---------------------------------------------------

The completeness of data recorded by law enforcement
about offenders who perpetrated violent victimizations
may indicate information about the investigation of the
incident, such as the willingness or ability of the victim
to provide information about the crime. Key pieces of
offender information examined here are the completeness
of demographic information (i.e., age, race, or sex) about
the primary offender involved in a violent victimization
and the relationship between the primary offender and
the victim in the incident.

Information on an offender's age, race, or sex was
less likely to be available for violent victimizations
involving older victims than for those involving younger
victims. From 2005 to 2009, law enforcement provided
information on the age, race, or sex of the primary
offender for the vast majority (92.5%) of all violent
victimizations reported to NIBRS in Michigan (table
6). For victims age 49 or younger, 7.4% of offender
demographic information was unknown or not reported.
For the oldest victims, those age 85 or older, the
percentage was nearly double, at 12.5%.

A similar pattern was found when examining the
relationship between the victim and the primary offender.
As victim age increased, the percentage of unknown
victim-offender relationships increased. For victims age
49 or younger, 17.5% of victim-offender relationships
were unknown or not reported, compared to 29.5% for
victims age 85 or older (table 7).
***********************************************
---------------------------------------------------
Among the elderly, persons age 85 or older had the
highest rate of rape and sexual assault
---------------------------------------------------

The rate of reported violent victimization in Michigan among
the elderly generally decreased with age; however, there
were exceptions to this pattern (table 8). The murder rate of
persons 85 or older (3.3 per 100,000 persons age 85 or older)
was 1.5 times higher than the rate for persons age 65 to 84
(1.9 per 100,000 persons age 65 to 84). The rate of forcible
rape and sexual assault of persons age 85 or older (11.9 per
100,000 persons) was more than 3 times greater than the rate
for persons ages 65 to 84 (3.6 per 100,000 persons). Finally,
the robbery rates were relatively similar for victims age 70
or older.

---------------------------------------------------
Firearms were involved in 1 out of 6 violent crimes
against elderly victims known to law enforcement in
Michigan
---------------------------------------------------

Three out of 10 (31.0%) violent victimizations of the elderly
involved a nonpersonal weapon (i.e., a firearm, knife, or
blunt object) (table 9). A firearm was the weapon most often
(16.5%) involved in violent crimes against elderly victims,
with the majority of those being handguns. Of all violent
crimes committed by a stranger against the elderly, 35.6%
involved a firearm, compared to 5.6% of violence committed
by a friend or acquaintance, 3.0% of violence committed
by an intimate partner, and 1.6% of violence committed by
the victim's own child or grandchild. An estimated 50.9% of
violent crimes against the elderly involved personal weapons
(i.e., hands, fists, feet, and teeth) while another 18.1%
involved no weapon or physical force.



---------------------------------------------------
About 4 out of 10 elderly victims of violent crime
known to law enforcement were physically injured
during the incident
---------------------------------------------------

Among elderly victims of violent crimes known to law
enforcement--

** The majority (60.3%) were not physically injured during
the incident (not shown in a table).

** About 33.2% experienced a minor physical injury.

** Nearly 6.5% suffered a major physical injury as a
consequence of the incident, such as death (1.0%), rape or
sexual assault (2.2%), or severe lacerations (1.2%).

---------------------------------------------------
Two-thirds of violence against the elderly occurred
inside a residence; more than half of violence inside a
residence occurred between 3 p.m. and 11 p.m.
---------------------------------------------------

The majority (63.6%) of elderly victims of reported violent
crime were victimized inside a residence (not shown in
a table). NIBRS data do not distinguish between types
of residence and may include the victim's own home,
the home of another person, or group quarters (e.g., a
residential or long-term care facility). An estimated 59.9%
of victimizations inside a residence were committed by a
family member, most often by the victim's own children
(25.5%), grandchildren (10.0%), or spouse or other intimate
partner (17.8%) (table 10). Friends or acquaintances of the
victim were responsible for a quarter (29.1%) of residential
violence against the elderly, while strangers were
responsible for a tenth (10.9%). Reported violent
victimization of the elderly that occurred outside a
residence was less likely to be committed by a family member
(18.2%), compared to a stranger (54.1%) and a friend or
acquaintance (27.7%).

Violence inside a residence generally occurred later in the
day than violence outside a residence. Violence inside a
residence peaked at 8 p.m., with half of these crimes taking
place between 3 p.m. and 11 p.m. (figure 4). Violence
outside a residence peaked at 2 p.m., with half of these
crimes taking place between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m., then
declining steeply through the night and early morning
hours.

---------------------------------------------------
Elderly women were nearly twice as likely as elderly
men to be assaulted by a child or grandchild in a
residence
---------------------------------------------------

Data from NIBRS made it possible to estimate the
probability that the violent victimization of an elderly
person in Michigan would exhibit certain characteristics.
Differences existed in the location, offense, and victim
offender relationship characteristics of a typical 1,000
reported violent victimizations of elderly males and a
typical 1,000 reported violent victimizations of elderly
females (table 11). When the elderly victim was male, the
violent victimization was most likely a simple assault that
took place inside a residence by a child or grandchild
(probability 15.2%) or a friend or acquaintance (12.2%), or
it was a robbery that occurred outside a residence by a
stranger (16.3%). Elderly female victims were most often
victims of a simple assault in a residence perpetrated by
their child or grandchild (27.7%), an intimate partner
(10.8%), or a friend or acquaintance (10.7%). An estimated
11.6% of elderly female victimizations was a robbery by a
stranger that occurred outside a residence.

Robberies accounted for 17.9% of elderly female
victimizations and 26.4% of elderly male victimizations.
Regardless of victim sex, more than two-thirds of these
robberies occurred outside a residence and were typically
committed by an offender who was a stranger to the
victim. In comparison, aggravated assaults of elderly male
and female victims more often occurred in a residence
and typically involved an offender who was known to the
victim (i.e., an intimate partner, child or grandchild,
family member, or friend or acquaintance). For elderly male
victims, 77.2% of victimizations by a stranger occurred
outside a residence, compared to 72.3% of victimizations of
elderly females.

Differences existed in the location, age of offender, and
victim-offender relationship characteristics of a typical
1,000 reported violent victimizations of elderly males and a
typical 1,000 reported violent victimizations of elderly
females. An elderly male victim was most likely to be
victimized in a residence by his own adult child or
grandchild between the ages of 35 and 49 (probability 8.1%)
or a friend or acquaintance in the same age group (8.1%)
(table 12). About 1 in 10 offenses against elderly males took
place outside a residence and were perpetrated by a stranger
between the ages of 12 and 24.

Elderly female victims were most often victimized in a
residence by their own adult child or grandchild between
the ages of 35 and 49 (probability 13.9%) or an intimate
partner of similar age to the victim (9.1%). More than a
third (34.6%) of violence against elderly female victims
occurred in a residence at the hands of the victim's own
child or grandchild.

---------------------------------------------------
2 out of 5 elderly victims of intimate partner violence
were male
---------------------------------------------------

While females accounted for 59.6% of elderly victims
of intimate partner violence (IPV) reported by law
enforcement, the percentage of elderly IPV victims who were
male (40.4%) was double the comparable percentage of male
IPV victims under age 65 (19.4%) (not shown in a table).
Unlike younger males and females, the rate of IPV was
nearly equal for elderly males (rate of 22.2 per 100,000
males age 65 or older) and elderly females (rate of 23.9 per
100,000 females age 65 or older) (table 13).

Among elderly victims of IPV, the offense profile was
different for males than for females. While IPV offenders
who victimized an elderly person were 3 times more likely
to be a spouse or ex-spouse than a boyfriend or girlfriend, a
larger percentage of elderly male (31.5%) than elderly female
(16.6%) victimizations involved a boyfriend or girlfriend
(table 14). Elderly male IPV victims (28.9%) were more
likely than elderly female IPV victims (13.7%) to experience
an aggravated assault at the hands of an intimate partner.
IPV victimizations of elderly males were more likely to
involve a gun, knife, or other nonpersonal weapon (31.2%)
than IPV victimizations of elderly females (13.7%).
Research conducted by the Police Foundation found that
a larger proportion of elderly male than elderly female
domestic abuse victims received police assistance. This
finding may indicate a difference between elderly males' 
and females' willingness to contact the police after
victimization.

The NIBRS data show that a larger percentage of elderly
male than elderly female IPV victims experienced an
aggravated assault or a victimization involving a weapon,
which could also influence the likelihood that more elderly
male IPV victimizations were known to law enforcement.

Chicago's Elderly: Risk Factors, Protective Behaviors, and
Police Intervention. Washington, DC: National Institute of
Justice.***

---------------------------------------------------
Intimate partners who victimized elderly men were
much younger than their victims
---------------------------------------------------

Among IPV victimizations of the elderly, 60.5% involved
victims who were older than their offenders, 32.8% were
younger, and 6.7% were the same age (table 15). Overall,
60.9% of IPV victimizations involved victims who were
within 10 years of the age of their offenders. However, the
pattern for victimizations of males was much different than
for victimizations of females.

IPV victimizations of elderly males (88.8%) were more
than twice as likely as IPV victimizations of elderly females
(42.2%) to involve victims who were older than their
offenders. Moreover, elderly male victims of IPV were more
likely than elderly female victims of IPV to be substantially
older than their offenders. Overall, nearly two-thirds of IPV
victimizations of elderly males involved a victim who was
more than 10 years older than the intimate partner who
victimized him, compared to a fifth of IPV victimizations of
elderly females. Further, IPV victimizations of elderly males
(42.4%) were two times more likely than IPV victimizations
of elderly females (10.5%) to involve victims who were more
than 20 years older than their offenders. Three-quarters of
elderly female victims of IPV victimizations were within 10
years of the age of their offenders, compared to just over a
third of elderly male victims.

---------------------------------------------------
About a third of violent crimes against the elderly
known to law enforcement were cleared
---------------------------------------------------

Law enforcement agencies clear a crime when at least one
person is arrested, charged, and turned over to the court
for prosecution. Law enforcement agencies may also clear
a crime by exceptional means, meaning that they have
identified the offender and have gathered enough evidence
to support that offender's arrest and prosecution, but have
encountered a circumstance outside the control of law
enforcement that prohibits the agency from arresting,
charging, and prosecuting the offender. Examples of
exceptional clearances include, but are not limited to, the
death of the offender (e.g., suicide or justifiably killed by
law enforcement or citizen), the prosecutor's decision to
decline prosecution of the case after it was referred from
law enforcement, the victim's refusal to cooperate with the
prosecution after the offender had been identified, or the
denial of extradition because the offender had committed
a crime in another jurisdiction and is being prosecuted for
that offense.

Law enforcement cleared 35.4% of reported violent crimes
committed against the elderly, with 31.6% of victimizations
resulting in the arrest of at least one offender and 3.8%
being cleared by exceptional means (table 16). The overall
clearance rate for violent crimes involving elderly victims
did not differ from the clearance rate of violent crimes
involving younger victims (not shown in a table).

Violence perpetrated by a person known to the elderly
victim was more likely to be cleared than violence by a
stranger. Offenses committed by the elderly victim's own
child or grandchild were the most likely to result in an
arrest (63.6%) compared to other victim-offender
relationships.

Among violent crimes against the elderly known to law
enforcement in Michigan--

** Homicides were the most likely (51.2%) to be cleared,
followed by simple assault (46.6%) (table 17).

** Robberies were the least likely (13.6%) to be cleared.

** Less than 1 out of 4 forcible rapes and other violent
sexual assaults were cleared.

** The majority of clearances were the result of an arrest
being made.

About 9 out of every 10 clearances in Michigan were
the result of an arrest. One exception to this pattern was
among clearances for forcible rape and sexual assault. Of all
clearances of rape and sexual assaults of the elderly, about
6 in 10 were cleared due to arrest, and an additional 3 in 10
were cleared because the prosecution declined the case.

------------------
About the data
------------------

The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) is a
data collection system designed and maintained by the FBI
that compiles data on all crimes recorded by participating
state and local law enforcement agencies. NIBRS captures
extensive information on each incident known to law
enforcement. The NIBRS database collects detailed offense
information using a large set of offense codes and incident
attributes. Information captured by NIBRS includes: victim
and offender demographics, date and time of incidents,
locations where incidents occurred, types of weapons
involved, magnitude of victim injury, and victim-offender
relationships, as well as whether the incident resulted in an
arrest or some other type of clearance.

Participation by law enforcement in NIBRS is voluntary and
requires certification by the FBI before an agency's data are
included in the system. In 2009, approximately 44% of state
and local law enforcement agencies reported their crime data
in the NIBRS format. Those agencies represented 28% of the
U.S. population, and their reported crime data represented
26% of the estimated crimes known to law enforcement
agencies in the nation. (See the FBI's Crime in the United
States, 2009 at http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/09cius.htm.)

This report uses NIBRS data provided by law enforcement
agencies in Michigan from 2005 to 2009 on violent crimes--
murder, non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, sexual
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, kidnapping, and simple
assault. Forcible rape includes forcible sodomy. Sexual
assault includes the violent offenses of sexual assault with
an object and forcible fondling. Sexual assault excludes
statutory rape and incest. Over this period, Michigan was
a complete reporter, meaning that the law enforcement
agencies reporting to NIBRS in that state represented 95% or
more of Michigan's population in all 5 years.

The unit of analysis for this report is a victimization
reported to NIBRS by law enforcement. A victim can be an
individual, a business, government agency, religious
organization, or the public. This report analyzed information
on victimizations of individuals only. A criminal incident
could contain one or more victimizations, depending on the
number of victims in the incident. In addition, an individual
could have more than one victimization over the time period.
Of the 823,587 violent victimizations known to law
enforcement in Michigan between 2005 and 2009, 76.8% involved
only one victim, while in the remaining 23.2% the
victimization involved two or more individual victims. Among
elderly victims age 65 or older, 80.0% of victimizations
involved a single victim.

The NIBRS reporting structure allows for multiple offenses
to be recorded for each victim. Of the more than 823,000
violent victimizations of individuals in Michigan, 6.9% were
victimizations with more than one offense, and victims in
7.3% of elderly victimizations experienced two or more
offenses. For those victims who experienced multiple
offenses in a single incident, a hierarchy rule was used to
determine the most serious offense. The NIBRS crime types
were ordered following the general hierarchy of violent,
property, drugs, weapons, and public order offenses. Within
the violent offense set, the hierarchy rule ordered offenses
from most to least serious as follows: murder, manslaughter,
forcible rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault,
kidnapping, and simple assault.

About a sixth (17.1%) of individual victims of violence were
victimized by two or more offenders. To determine which
offender to classify as the primary offender, offenders were
ranked hierarchically on a continuum that ranged from  the
following: intimate partner, child, grandchild, sibling,
other family member, friend or acquaintance, and stranger.
The offender with the closest relationship to the victim was
targeted in the analysis as the primary offender.

-----------------------
Rate calculations
-----------------------

All victimization rates were calculated using the number
of victimizations across the 5-year study period from 2005
to 2009 as the numerator, then dividing that total by the
annual estimate of the resident population of Michigan
summed across the 5-year period for the appropriate groups
or subgroups. This report used bridged-race population
estimates developed by the National Center for Health
Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau.*** Footnote 3 
National Center for Health Statistics. (2010). Postcensal
estimates of the resident population of the United States for
July 1, 2000-July 1, 2009, by year, county, age, bridged
race, Hispanic origin, and sex. Available at: www.*** 
All rates were per 100,000 Michigan residents in the specific
age, sex, or race group. Rates by Hispanic origin were not
calculated due to a large amount of missing information on
that variable in the NIBRS data.
