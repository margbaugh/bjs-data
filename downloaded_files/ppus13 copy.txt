Probation and Parole in the 
United States, 2013

Erinn J. Herberman, Ph.D., and Thomas P. Bonczar, 
BJS Statisticians

At yearend 2013, an estimated 4,751,400 adults were under 
community supervision—a decline of about 29,900 offenders from 
yearend 2012 (figure 1).***Footnote * The community supervision 
population excludes parolees who were on probation to avoid double 
counting offenders. See table 7 and Methodology.*** About 1 in 51 
adults in the United  States was under community supervision 
at yearend 2013. The community supervision population includes 
adults on probation, parole, or any other post-prison supervision. 
(See BJS definition  of probation and parole.)

The small decline in the number of adults under community 
supervision was due to the drop in the probation population. 
Probationers accounted for most (82%) of the adults under 
community supervision. The probation population declined from an 
estimated 3,942,800 offenders at yearend 2012 to 3,910,600 at 
yearend 2013, falling about 32,100 offenders. The decline in the 
adult community corrections population was slightly offset by a 
small increase in the parole population, which grew from about 
851,200 offenders at yearend 2012 to 853,200 at yearend 2013.

their conditions of supervision iremained stable at about 9% 
in 2013.

*****************************************************

Data in this report were collected through the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics’ (BJS) Annual Probation Survey and Annual Parole 
Survey. Both surveys began in 1980 and collect data from U.S. 
probation and parole agencies that supervise adults. For this 
report, an adult is any person subject to the jurisdiction of an 
adult trial court or corrections agency. Juveniles prosecuted as 
adults in a criminal court are considered adults. Respondents are 
asked to report the number of adults on probation or parole at 
the beginning and end of each reporting year, the number entering 
and exiting supervision during the year, characteristics of the 
populations at yearend, and other information. Reporting methods 
for some probation and parole agencies have changed over time 
(see Methodology). Appendix tables present additional 2013 data 
by jurisdiction.

*****************************************
Community supervision population declined 
in 2013, due to a drop in probationers 
*****************************************

The number of U.S. adults under community supervision declined by 
about 29,900 (down 0.6%) between yearend 2012 and 2013, dropping 
to an estimated 4,751,400 offenders at yearend 2013 (table 1). 
The number of adults under community supervision at yearend 
declined for the first time in 2008 and continued to decrease 
each year through 2013. This decline follows more than two and a 
half decades of population growth (ranging from 0.6% to12.9%), as 
the number of adults under community supervision increased each 
year from 1980 to 2007. For trend data beginning in 1980, see 
Probation and Parole in the United States, 2011 (NCJ 239686, BJS 
web, November 2012).

*****************************************************

*****************************************
BJS definition of probation and parole
*****************************************

Probation is a court-ordered period of correctional supervision 
in the community, generally as an alternative to incarceration. 
In some cases, probation can be a combined sentence of 
incarceration followed by a period of community supervision.

Parole is a period of conditional supervised release in the 
community following a prison term. It includes parolees released 
through discretionary or mandatory supervised release from 
prison, those released through other types of post-custody 
conditional supervision, and those sentenced to a term of 
supervised release.
*****************************************************

The probation population declined by about 32,100 between yearend 
2012 and 2013, falling to an estimated 3,910,600 offenders at 
yearend 2013 (figure 2; appendix table 2). During the same 
period, the parole population grew by about 2,100, increasing to 
an estimated 853,200 offenders at yearend 2013 (figure 3; 
appendix table 4).

********************************************
Rate of adults under community supervision 
continued to decline during 2013
********************************************

Community supervision and probation rates declined each year from 
2007 to 2013, while parole rates fluctuated. The rate of adults 
under community supervision fell from 1,980 offenders per 100,000 
U.S. adult residents at yearend 2012 to 1,950 at yearend 2013, 
which was consistent with the decline in the number of adults 
under community supervision (table 2). The probation rate dropped 
from 1,633 offenders per 100,000 U.S. adult residents at yearend 
2012 to 1,605 at yearend 2013.

Although the number of offenders on parole increased somewhat, 
the rate declined slightly (from 353 parolees per 100,000 U.S. 
adult residents at yearend 2012 to 350 at yearend 2013), given 
that the U.S. adult resident population also increased.

*****************************************
Probation entries increased following 
five consecutive years of decline; 
exits increased after three consecutive 
years of decline
*****************************************

During 2013, movement both onto and off probation increased 
(figure 4). Probation entries increased (up 2.2%) from about 
2,048,300 entries during 2012 to 2,094,100 during 2013. Probation 
exits also increased (up 2.0%) during the same period, from about 
2,089,800 exits during 2012 to 2,131,300 during 2013. Overall, 
more than 4.2 million movements occurred onto and off probation 
during 2013, compared to nearly 4.1 million during 2012. 

During 2009, the number of exits from probation exceeded the 
number of entries for the first time since data collection began. 
This trend continued during 2013, with exits from probation 
exceeding entries by approximately 37,200. (See Methodology for 
a discussion of estimating change in population counts.)

*****************************************
Completion rates for probationers have 
remained stable since 2009
*****************************************

The completion rate--turnover due to completing the term of 
supervision either through a full-term completion or early 
discharge—was 36 exits per 100 probationers during 2013. This 
rate is consistent with rates observed since 2009 (table 3). 

The rate at which probationers exit supervision--the number that 
exit probation divided by the average of the probation population 
at the beginning and end of the year—provides a measure of how 
quickly the population turns over and an indirect measure of the 
average time an offender can expect to serve on probation. The 
exit rate increased slightly during 2013, from 53 per 100 
probationers in 2012 to 54 per 100 in 2013, which resulted in a 
small decline in the mean length of stay on probation (from 23 
months in 2012 to 22 months in 2013).

During 2013, 66% of the 2,131,300 probationers who exited 
supervision were discharged because they either completed their 
term of supervision or received an early discharge—a slight 
decrease from 68% in 2012 (table 4).The incarceration rate 
(15% was unchanged from 2012. 

**********************************************
Incarceration rate among at-risk probationers 
remained stable in 2013
**********************************************
The incarceration rate among probationers at risk of violating
their conditions of supervision—including incarceration for
a new offense, a revocation, and other reasons--was stable in
2013 at 5.4% (figure 5).  The incarceration rate is defined as
the ratio of the number of probationers who were discharged
during the year as the result of incarceration to the number
of probationers who were at risk of incarceration at any
point during the year. The probation population at risk of
incarceration is comprised of the population at the beginning
of the year and all probation entries during the year.

*****************************************
Percentage of females on probation 
increased slightly since 2000
*****************************************

The percentage of females in the adult probation population 
increased slightly over the past decade, climbing from 22% in 
2000 to 25% in 2013 (appendix table 3). At yearend 2013, over 
half (54%) of probationers were non-Hispanic white, 30% were non-
Hispanic black, and 14% were Hispanic or Latino—
a similar distribution for race and Hispanic origin observed 
since 2000. The percentage of probationers supervised for a 
felony offense increased from 52% in 2000 to 55% in 2013. The 
percentage of probationers on active status has decreased since 
2000, falling from 76% in 2000 to 69% in 2013. 

*****************************************************

*****************************************
California Public Safety Realignment
*****************************************

California’s Public Safety Realignment (PSR) policy responded to 
a U.S. Supreme Court mandate to reduce prison overcrowding. The 
policy took effect on October 1, 2011. The PSR is designed to 
reduce the prison population through normal attrition of the 
existing population while placing new offenders not convicted of 
violent, serious, or sexual offenses under county jurisdiction 
for incarceration in local jail facilities rather than state 
prisons. Under the PSR, offenders not convicted of violent, 
serious, or sexual offenses who are serving time in state prisons 
become eligible for post-release community supervision (PRCS) 
rather than the traditional state parole. Some new offenders 
receive a straight sentence to county jail, while other new 
offenders’ sentences include a term of mandatory supervision (MS) 
in the community following release from incarceration. Both the 
PRCS and MS populations fall within the BJS definition of parole, 
which includes post-custody conditional supervision.

At yearend 2013, California’s combined parole population (87,500 
offenders) included an estimated 45,600 offenders under state 
parole by the California Department of Corrections and 
Rehabilitation (CDCR), 33,100 offenders on PRCS, and 8,800 
offenders on MS (figure 6). At yearend 2010, the year before PSR 
took effect, California’s parole population (105,100 offenders) 
was comprised entirely of parolees under state parole. By yearend 
2013, the state’s combined parole population declined by 17,600 
offenders. During this time, California’s state parole population 
declined by 59,500 offenders, while the PRCS and MS populations 
increased to 41,900 offenders. Nationally, the parole population 
grew by 12,500 offenders (up 1.5%) between yearend 2010 and 
yearend 2013. The increase of about 4.1% (up 30,100 offenders) in 
jurisdictions other than California since 2010 was partially 
offset by the decrease in California’s parole population.

Combined total entries to parole in California declined 64%, from 
166,300 offenders in 2010 (when all entries were to state parole) 
to an estimated 60,000 in 2013 (figure 7).***Footnote 1 Entries 
and exits to state parole supervision for 2013 were not available 
from the CDCR and were imputed by BJS. See Methodology.*** This 
was the result of a decrease in entries to state parole of nearly 
80%, to an estimated 35,400 during 2013.

The smaller number of entries to state parole during 2013 was 
partially offset by entries to the newly established PRCS and MS. 
In 2013, state parolees accounted for 59% (35,400) of combined 
total entries, PRCS accounted for 30% (17,900), and MS accounted 
for 11% (6,700). In 2013, combined total exits (67,600) from 
parole supervision exceeded entries (60,000). (figure 8). 

Since PSR was implemented, entries to probation increased nearly 
15%, from an estimated 149,000 offenders in 2010 to 170,800 in 
2013. During the same period, California’s probation population 
remained relatively stable, growing 0.4% (up about 1,200 
offenders) (table 5).
*****************************************************

*****************************************
U.S. parole population increased 
slightly in 2013
*****************************************

From yearend 2012 to 2013, the parole population increased 
slightly (up about 2,100 offenders), from an estimated 851,200 
offenders at yearend 2012 to 853,200 at yearend 2013. Both the 
state (up about 1,600 offenders) and federal (up 500 offenders) 
parole populations grew slightly during this period.

*****************************************
Parole entries and exits declined during 
2013; exits decreased at a faster rate
*****************************************

In 2013, about 922,900 movements occurred onto and off parole, 
with an estimated 465,400 entries and about 457,500 exits (figure 
9). Both entries and exits have declined since 2009. During 2013, 
the decline in exits (7.8%) exceeded the decline in entries 
(6.2%). The decline in entries to parole was consistent with the 
2.1% decline in the number of prison releases from yearend 2012 
to yearend 2013. For more information, see Prisoners in 2013 (NCJ 
247282, BJS web, September 2014).

*****************************************
Parole turnover rate decreased for 
fourth consecutive year 
*****************************************

The parole turnover rate fell from 58 exits per 100 parolees in 
2012 to 54 per 100 parolees in 2013, continuing a downward trend 
that started in 2009 (table 6). This decline resulted in an 
increase in the mean length of stay on parole, rising from 21 
months in 2012 to 22 months in 2013.  

The rate of parolees who completed their term of supervision or 
received an early discharge decreased from 34 per 100 parolees in 
2012 to 33 per 100 parolees in 2013, while the rate of parolees 
who exited supervision and returned to incarceration decreased 
from 15 per 100 parolees in 2012 to 14 per 100 parolees in 2013.

*****************************************
Reincarceration rate among at-risk parolees 
remained stable during 2013
*****************************************

An estimated 9.3% of all parolees who were at risk of
reincarceration were incarcerated during 2013—about the
same as in 2012 (figure 10). The incarceration rate is defined
as the ratio of the number of parolees who were discharged
during the year as the result of incarceration to the number of
parolees who were at risk of incarceration at any point during
the year. The parole population at risk of incarceration is
defined as the sum of the population at the beginning of the
year and all parole entries during the year.

During 2013, 3.0% of parolees who were at risk of reincarceration 
were incarcerated for a new sentence. The rate at which 
parolees were reincarcerated as a result of revocation was 
about 5.4% in 2013.
 
*****************************************
Most characteristics of parolees were 
unchanged during 2013
*****************************************

Characteristics of adult parolees remained stable when compared 
to those in 2012. Males continued to make up about 88% of the 
adult parole population (appendix table 6). Approximately 43% of 
parolees were non-Hispanic white, 38% were non-Hispanic black, 
and 17% were Hispanic or Latino. The percentage of parolees on 
active supervision increased from 82% in 2012 to 84% in 2013. 
During the same period, the majority (95%) of parolees had a 
maximum sentence of one year or more and 29% of parolees were 
being supervised for a violent offense—both levels unchanged from 
those observed in 2012.

*****************
Methodology 
*****************

The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) Annual Probation Survey 
and Annual Parole Survey began in 1980 and collect data from 
probation and parole agencies in the United States that supervise 
adults. In these data, adults are persons subject to the 
jurisdiction of an adult court or correctional agency. Juveniles 
prosecuted as adults in a criminal court are considered adults. 
Juveniles under the jurisdiction of a juvenile court or 
correctional agency are excluded from these data. The National 
Criminal Justice Information and Statistics Service of the Law 
Enforcement Assistance Administration, BJS’s predecessor agency, 
began a statistical series on parole in 1976 and on probation in 
1979.

The two surveys collect data on the total number of adults 
supervised in the community on January 1 and December 31 each 
year, the number of entries and exits to supervision during the 
reporting year, and characteristics of the population at yearend. 
See appendix tables for detailed data.

Both surveys cover all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 
the federal system. BJS depends on the voluntary participation of 
state central reporters and separate state, county, and court 
agencies for these data.

During 2013, Westat (Rockville, MD) served as BJS’s collection 
agent for the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data for 
the federal system were provided directly to BJS from the Office 
of Probation and Pretrial Services, Administrative Office of the 
United States Courts through the Federal Justice Statistics 
Program.

Probation 
*************

The 2013 Annual Probation Survey was sent to 468 respondents: 33 
central state reporters; 435 separate state, county, or court 
agencies, including the state probation agency in Pennsylvania, 
which also provided data for 65 counties in Pennsylvania; the 
District of Columbia; and the federal system. The states with 
multiple reporters were Alabama (3), Arizona (2), Colorado (8), 
Florida (41), Georgia (2), Idaho (2), Kentucky (3), Michigan 
(134), Missouri (2), Montana (4), New Mexico (2), Ohio (187), 
Oklahoma (3), Pennsylvania (2), Tennessee (3), Washington (33), 
and West Virginia (2).

Two localities in Colorado, five in Florida, 13 in Michigan, nine 
in Ohio, and two in Washington did not provide data for the 2013 
collection. For these localities, the agency’s most recent 
December 31 population was used to estimate the January 1 and 
December 31, 2013, populations. The largest respondent in 
Oklahoma, composing the majority of the state’s probation 
population, provided limited estimates for the 2013 collection 
that were used in the state and national totals but not used to 
estimate Oklahoma state populations.

Parole
*********

The 2013 Annual Parole Survey was sent to 54 respondents: 50 
central state reporters; one municipal agency in Alabama; the 
state parole agency in Pennsylvania, which also provided data for 
65 counties in Pennsylvania; the District of Columbia; and the 
federal system. 

In this report, federal parole includes a term of supervised 
release from prison, mandatory release, parole, military parole, 
and special parole. A term of supervised release is ordered at 
the time of sentencing by a federal judge, and it is served after 
release from a federal prison sentence. Definitional differences 
exist between parole reported here and in other BJS statistical 
series.

Additional information about the data collection instruments is 
available on the BJS website at www.bjs.gov.

Adjustments to account for offenders 
with dual community correctional status
*****************************************

Some offenders on probation or parole may have had dual community 
correctional statuses because they were serving separate 
probation and parole sentences concurrently. With the 2007 data, 
BJS began collecting information on the number of parolees who 
were also on probation at yearend. To avoid double counting, the 
total community supervision populations from 2008 through 2013 
reported in figure 1 (and the 2013 counts in appendix table 1) 
have been adjusted based on available information by excluding 
the total number of parolees who were also on probation. As a 
result, the probation and parole counts from 2008 through 2013 do 
not sum to the total community supervision population in the same 
year.

All of the estimates for parolees with dual community 
correctional statuses are based on data reported by parole 
agencies that were able to provide the information for the 
reporting year (table 7). Some probation and parole agencies were 
not able to provide these data. Therefore, the total number of 
parolees also on probation from 2008 through 2013 may be 
underestimated, which may result in overestimations of the total 
population under community supervision.

Reporting changes in the number of adults 
on probation and parole, 2000–2013
*****************************************

In a given data collection year, respondents are asked to provide 
both the January 1 and December 31 population counts. At times, 
the January 1 count differs greatly from the December 31 count of 
the prior year. The difference reported may result from 
administrative changes, such as implementing new information 
systems, resulting in data review and cleanup; reconciling 
probationer records; reclassifying offenders, including those on 
probation to parole and offenders on dual community supervision 
statuses; and including certain probation populations not 
previously reported (e.g., supervised for an offense of driving 
while intoxicated or under the influence, some probationers who 
had absconded, and some on an inactive status). The cumulative 
discrepancies between the yearend and beginning year (for the 
year following) between 2000 and 2012 in the probation population 
counts resulted in an overall decline of about 136,543 
probationers (table 8). Discrepancies between the yearend and 
following year parole population count resulted in an increase of 
about 11,158 parolees between 2000 and 2012 (table 9).

Probation coverage expanded, 1998–1999 
*****************************************

The number of probation agencies included in the survey expanded 
in 1998 and continued to expand through 1999 to include 
misdemeanor probation agencies in a few states that fell within 
the scope of this survey. For a discussion of this expansion, see 
Probation and Parole in the United States, 2010 (NCJ 236019, BJS 
web, November 2011).

Estimating change in population counts
*****************************************

Technically, the change in the probation and parole populations 
from the beginning of the year to the end of the year should 
equal the difference between entries and exits during the year. 
However, those numbers may not be equal. Some probation and 
parole information systems track the number of cases that enter 
and exit community supervision, not the number of offenders. This 
means that entries and exits may include case counts as opposed 
to counts of offenders, while the beginning and yearend 
population counts represent individuals. Additionally, all of the 
data on entries and exits may not have been logged into the 
information systems, or the information systems may not have 
fully processed all of the data before the data were submitted 
to BJS.

At the national level, 2,014 probationers were the difference 
between the change in the probation population measured by the 
difference between January 1 and December 31, 2013, populations 
and the difference between probation entries and exits during 
2013. For parole, 5,702 parolees were the difference between the 
change in the parole population measured by the difference 
between January 1 and December 31, 2013, populations and the 
difference between parole entries and exits during 2013.

The percentage change reported in appendix tables 1, 2, and 
4 were calculated as the difference between the January 1 and 
December 31 populations within the reporting year.

In figures 1, 2, and 3, the annual percentage change was based on 
the difference between the December 31 populations for each year. 
As previously discussed, jurisdiction counts reported for January 
1 may be different from December 31 counts reported in the 
previous year. As a result, the direction of change based on 
yearend data could be in the opposite direction of the within-
year change.

Imputing for nonreporting agencies 
during 2013
*****************************************

BJS used the methods described below to impute missing probation 
and parole data for key items, including the January 1, 2013, 
population, entries, exits, and the December 31, 2013, 
population.

Imputing the January 1, 2013, probation 
population
*****************************************

When the January 1, 2013, probation population was missing, the 
December 31, 2012, probation population value was carried over. 
This method was used to estimate the January 1, 2013, probation 
population in nonreporting counties and district agencies in 
Colorado, Florida, Michigan, Ohio, and Washington.

Imputing the December 31, 2013, 
probation population
*****************************************

When the December 31, 2013, probation population was missing 
along with either the total entries or total exits, the missing 
value was imputed by estimating the net difference between the 
December 31, 2013, population and the January 1, 2013, population 
based on the ratio of the 2012 net difference between the 
December 31, 2012, population and the January 1, 2012, population 
to the January 1, 2012, population, and then adding the estimated 
difference to the January 1, 2013, population. This method was 
used to estimate the December 31, 2013, probation population in 
nonreporting counties and district agencies in Colorado, Florida, 
Michigan, Ohio, and Washington.

Imputing probation entries
****************************

Based on the availability of data, BJS used three methods of 
ratio estimation to impute probation entries for agencies not 
reporting these data. The first method was used to estimate 
entries for probation agencies that were unable to report these 
data in 2013 but were able to report in 2012. BJS estimated 
probation entries in 2013 by using the ratio of entries in 2012 
to the agency’s probation population on January 1, 2012, and 
applying that ratio to the agency’s January 1, 2013, population. 
This method was used to estimate probation entries in 
nonreporting counties and district agencies in Alaska, Colorado, 
Florida, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Washington.
 
The second method was used to estimate 2013 probation entries for 
agencies that did not report entries in both 2012 and 2013. The 
ratio of 2013 entries to the January 1, 2013, population among 
reporting agencies of similar size within the state was used to 
estimate the number of entries for nonreporting agencies. This 
method was used to estimate probation entries and exits for 
nonreporting counties and district agencies in Florida, Michigan, 
Ohio, and Washington.

The third method was used to estimate probation entries by using 
the ratio of 2012 imputed entries to the January 1, 2012, 
probation population and applying that ratio to the agency’s 
January 1, 2013, population. This method was used to estimate 
probation entries and exits for nonreporting agencies in 
Colorado, New Mexico, and Rhode Island.

Imputing parole entries
**************************

To estimate parole entries for parole agencies that were unable 
to report these data in 2013 but were able to report in 2012, BJS 
calculated the ratio of entries in 2012 to the agency’s parole 
population on January 1, 2012, and applied that ratio to the 
agency’s January 1, 2013, population. This method was used to 
estimate parole entries in California.

Imputing probation and parole exits
*************************************

A single method was used to estimate probation and parole exits. 
For both probation and parole, BJS added the agency’s estimated 
entries in 2013 to the agency’s population on January 1, 2013, 
and subtracted that estimate from the population on December 31, 
2013. For probation, this method was used in Colorado, Florida, 
Kentucky, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, Rhode Island, Washington, 
and West Virginia. For parole, this method was used in 
California.

Calculating mean length of stay
**********************************

Mean length of stay is calculated as the inverse of the exit 
rate. Patterson and Preston (2007) provide tests of various 
methods for estimating expected length of stay and report the 
results of simulations showing that under assumptions of a 
stationary population with a small growth rate, the inverse of 
the exit rate performs well relative to a life-table approach to 
estimating mean time served.***Footnote 2 See Patterson, E.J. & 
Preston, S.H. (2007). Estimating Mean Length of Stay in Prison: 
Methods and Applications. Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 
24:33–49.*** Based on the small growth rates in the probation and 
parole populations in recent years, the inverse of the exit rate 
suffices to provide an estimate of mean stay on probation or 
parole in recent years.

Community supervision outcome measures
*****************************************

The percentage of probationers and the percentage of parolees who 
completed supervision are defined as the number of probationers 
or parolees who completed supervision during the year and were 
discharged, among all probationers or parolees who were 
discharged from supervision during the year. The formula used to 
calculate this outcome measure is C(t)/D(t), where D(t) = C(t) + 
I(t) + O(t). In this formula, t equals the year referenced, C(t) 
equals the number of probationers or parolees who were discharged 
from supervision during the year after completing their terms or 
who received an early discharge, and D(t) equals the total number 
who were discharged from supervision during the year. D(t) 
includes C(t), the number of offenders who completed supervision; 
I(t), the number who were incarcerated during the year; and O(t), 
the number who were discharged during the year for other reasons.

The percentage of probationers and the percentage of parolees 
incarcerated are calculated using the formula in the previous 
paragraph, except the numerator is the number of probationers or 
parolees who were discharged from supervision during the year as 
the result of being incarcerated.

The rate of incarceration (for parolees this is also referred to 
as the rate of return to incarceration or the rate of 
reincarceration) based on the at-risk probation or parole 
population is defined as the ratio of the number of probationers 
or parolees who were discharged from supervision during the year 
because they were incarcerated for a new offense, a revocation, 
or other reasons, to the number of all probationers or parolees 
at risk of being incarcerated during the year. The at-risk 
population is defined as the number of probationers or parolees 
under supervision at the start of the year (on January 1) plus 
the number who entered supervision during the year. This pool of 
probationers or parolees could be incarcerated at any time during 
the year; therefore, they were at risk of incarceration. The 
formula used to calculate this outcome measure is I(t)/(P(t-1) + 
E(t)), where t equals the year referenced, P(t-1) equals the 
start of the year population, and E(t) equals the number of 
probationers or parolees who entered supervision during the year.
The at-risk measure of incarceration accounts for all 
probationers or parolees under supervision during the year (i.e., 
probationers or parolees who were under supervision on January 1 
plus those who entered during the year) who are the probationers 
or parolees at risk of being incarcerated. This measure is not 
limited to those who are discharged during the year and permits 
each probationer and parolee to be incarcerated at any time 
during the year.

Change in the Annual Parole Survey 
************************************

In 2008, the Annual Parole Survey included a new category for 
type of entry to parole, term of supervised release (TSR). TSR is 
a fixed period of release to the community that follows a fixed 
period of incarceration based on a determinate sentencing 
statute; both are determined by a judge at the time of 
sentencing. Accordingly, some states began reporting term of 
supervised releases in 2008. The new category was added to better 
classify the large majority of entries to parole reported by the 
federal system. For detail on estimation methods to analyze 
national trends for all types of entry to parole, see Probation 
and Parole in the United States, 2010 (NCJ 236019, BJS web, 
November 2011). 

Types of federal offenders under 
community supervision
************************************

Since the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was enacted on November 
1, 1987, offenders sentenced to federal prison are no longer 
eligible for parole but are required to serve a term of 
supervised release following release from prison. Those sentenced 
to prison prior to November 1, 1987, continue to be eligible for 
parole, as do persons violating laws of the District of Columbia, 
military offenders, and foreign treaty transfer offenders (see 
http://www.uscourts.gov/news/TheThirdBranch/11-05-
01/Parole_in_the_Federal_Probation_System.aspx).
 
The Sentencing Reform Act also requires the adoption and use of 
sentencing guidelines, which also took effect on November 1, 
1987. Many offenses for which probation had been the typical 
sentence prior to this date, particularly property and regulatory 
offenses, subsequently resulted in sentences to prison. Changes 
in how federal offenders are supervised in the community were 
first described in the BJS report, Federal Offenders under 
Community Supervision, 1987–96 (NCJ 168636, BJS web, August 
1998), and updated in the report, Federal Criminal Case 
Processing, 2002: With trends 1982-2002, Reconciled Data (NCJ 
207447, BJS web, January 2005). 

Probation: Explanatory notes
*****************************************

Colorado--Nonreporting agencies in 2013—two local agencies did 
not report data. The most recently available December 31 
population count was used to estimate January 1, 2013, and 
December 31, 2013, populations. See Imputing for nonreporting 
agencies during 2013 for additional information on imputing 
entries and exits for nonreporting agencies.  

Florida--Nonreporting agencies in 2013—five local agencies did 
not report data. The most recently available December 31 
population count was used to estimate January 1, 2013, and 
December 31, 2013, populations. See Imputing for nonreporting 
agencies during 2013 for additional information on imputing 
entries and exits for nonreporting agencies.

Georgia--Probation counts may overstate the number of persons 
under probation supervision because the agency that reports 
county data has the capacity to report probation cases and not 
the number of persons under supervision. Probationers with 
multiple sentences could potentially have one or more cases with 
one or more private probation agencies in one jurisdiction and/or 
one or more private probation agencies within jurisdictions. 
Georgia reporting changes between 2012 and 2013—data are not 
comparable to those reported in previous years. Starting on 
January 1, 2013, Georgia began including previously unaccounted 
misdemeanant probationers in its population counts. This change 
in reporting methods resulted in an increase of 73,835 
probationers on January 1, 2013 (515,896), compared to December 
31, 2012 (442,061).  

Maryland--Reporting changes between 2012 and 2013—data for 2013 
are not comparable to those reported in previous years. Starting 
on January 1, 2013, Maryland began reporting on the number of 
persons under supervision, as opposed to cases, resulting in a 
decrease of 55,517 probationers on January 1, 2013 (41,123), 
compared to December 31, 2012 (96,640).

Michigan--Nonreporting agencies in 2013—13 local agencies did not 
report data. The most recently available December 31 population 
count was used to estimate January 1, 2013, and December 31, 
2013, populations. See Imputing for nonreporting agencies during 
2013 for additional information on imputing entries and exits for 
nonreporting agencies. Closed agencies in 2013—three agencies 
were removed from the roster because its cases were transferred 
to two other agencies.

Ohio--Nonreporting agencies in 2013—nine local agencies did not 
report data. The most recently available December 31 population 
count was used to estimate January 1, 2013, and December 31, 
2013, populations. See Imputing for nonreporting agencies during 
2013 for additional information on imputing entries and exits for 
nonreporting agencies.

Oklahoma--Nonreporting agencies in 2013—one local agency did not 
report data but provided estimates for the January 1, 2013, and 
December 31, 2013, populations, entries, and exits that were used 
in the state and national totals.  

Pennsylvania--Reporting changes between 2012 and 2013—data for 
2013 are not comparable to those reported in previous years. 
Beginning on January 1, 2013, Pennsylvania resolved a double-
counting issue, resulting in a decrease of 15,552 probationers on 
January 1, 2013 (162,225), compared to December 31, 2012 
(177,777).

Washington--Nonreporting agencies in 2013—two local agencies did 
not report data. The most recently available December 31 
population count was used to estimate January 1, 2013, and 
December 31, 2013, populations. See Imputing for nonreporting 
agencies during 2013 for additional information on imputing 
entries and exits for nonreporting agencies. 

West Virginia--Closed agency in 2013—one agency was removed from 
the roster because its counts were included in the data from 
other agencies.

Parole: Explanatory notes
****************************

California--Closed agency in 2013--one agency was removed from the 
roster because it no longer supervised parolees for the state. 
Nonreporting agencies in 2013—one agency was not able to report 
entries and exits due to a high-level data conversion project.  

California reporting changes between 2012 and 2013--data are not 
comparable to those reported in previous years. Starting on 
January 1, 2013, the number of persons under mandatory 
supervision were included in the total parole population and 
adjustments were made to the number of parolees under post-
release community supervision, resulting in an increase of 5,833 
parolees on January 1, 2013 (95,120), compared to December 31, 
2012 (89,287).

California’s total parole population includes 33,847 persons on 
January 1, 2013, and 33,129 persons on December 31, 2013, who 
were under post-release community supervision as a result of 
California's Public Safety Realignment. These persons account for 
17,867 parolees entering and 18,585 parolees exiting supervision 
during 2013. 

California’s total parole population includes 4,934 persons on 
January 1, 2013, and 8,818 persons on December 31, 2013, under 
mandatory supervision. These persons account for 6,692 parolees 
entering and 2,808 parolees exiting supervision during 2013. 
Detailed information on the types of entries and exits were not 
available for these populations. 

Maryland--Reporting changes between 2012 and 2013--
data for 2013 are not comparable to those reported in
previous years. Starting on January 1, 2013, Maryland began
reporting on the number of persons under supervision, as
opposed to cases, resulting in a decrease of 7,985 parolees
on January 1, 2013 (5,648), compared to December 31, 2012
(13,633). 

Pennsylvania--Reporting changes between 2012 and 2013--
data for 2013 are not comparable to those reported in previous
years. Starting on January 1, 2013, Pennsylvania resolved a
double-counting issue, resulting in a decrease of 9,036 parolees
on January 1, 2013 (92,315), compared to December 31, 2012
(101,351).

Washington--Reporting changes between 2012 and 2013--data for 2013 
are not comparable to those reported in previous years. Washington’s 
parole population increased by 6,196 between December 31, 2012 
(8,895) and January 1, 2013 (15,091), at least in part because 
of the inclusion of inactive cases for the first time in 2013.
