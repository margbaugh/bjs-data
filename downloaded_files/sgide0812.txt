Special Report
	
State Government Indigent Defense Expenditures, 
FY 2008–2012 – Updated

Erinn Herberman, Ph.D., and Tracey Kyckelhahn, Ph.D., 
BJS Statisticians

In 2012, state governments spent $2.3 billion nationally on 
indigent defense. From 2008 to 2012, state government indigent 
defense expenditures ranged from $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion 
(figure 1). 

The majority of state government indigent defense expenditures 
were for services directly provided by the state (92% each year 
from 2008 to 2012) (table 1). The remainder of state government 
indigent defense expenditures were intergovernmental transfers to 
local governments to fund local indigent defense services. While 
direct expenditures held steady, intergovernmental transfers 
declined from $195 million to $180 million between 2011 and 2012 
(down 7.6%). From 2011 to 2012, state government indigent defense 
expenditures remained stable at $2.3 billion.

Highlights
************

* In 2012, state governments spent $2.3 billion nationally on 
indigent defense.  

* State government indigent defense expenditures showed an average 
annual decrease of 0.2% from 2008 to 2012. 

* From 2011 to 2012, state government indigent defense 
expenditures remained stable at $2.3 billion.  

* As a share of total judicial-legal expenditures by state 
governments, spending on indigent defense held steady between 9.5% 
and 10.0% from 2008 to 2012.
***********************************************

From 2008 to 2012, state government spending on all judicial-legal 
services ranged from $22.8 to $23.6 billion (table 2). As a share 
of total judicial-legal expenditures by state governments, 
spending on indigent defense held steady between 9.5% and 10.0% 
during this period. 

The data used in this report are from a larger study funded by the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and produced by the Census 
Bureau. The study, Indigent Defense Services in the United States, 
FY 2008–2012 (NCJ 246683, BJS web, July 2014), contains 
information on—

* state legislation related to the provision of indigent defense 

* the availability, quality, and sources of data for state 
government indigent defense expenditures for each state and the 
District of Columbia 

* total, direct, and intergovernmental indigent defense 
expenditures by state limited information on indigent defense 
expenditures by some local governments. 
  
For this report, financial data for fiscal years 2008 to 2012 were 
inflation-adjusted to 2012 constant dollars (see Methodology). For 
the Census Bureau’s Indigent Defense Services (IDS) study, 
expenditure data are in nominal dollars.

The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution 
guarantee that people accused of crimes who cannot afford an 
attorney have the right to appointed counsel. In response to the 
U.S. Supreme Court mandate for appointed counsel, states enacted 
various methods to provide indigent defense services. Indigent 
defense funding, service delivery, and administration differ by 
state. Depending on the state, indigent defense expenditures are 
funded by the state or local governments, or a combination of 
both. Pennsylvania is the only state that does not provide any 
state-based funding for indigent defense, leaving all financial 
responsibility to the counties. States also have varying methods 
of service delivery for indigent defense, using different 
combinations of public defender offices, assigned counsel systems, 
or contract systems with private attorneys. In addition, the 
source of administration at the state or local levels for indigent 
defense services varies across states, including sources of 
governance, policy determinations, and operations.  

Some state-administered systems are not funded completely by the 
state. Some county-administered systems are funded entirely by the 
state government. Caution must be taken when comparing states on 
the total state government indigent defense expenditures presented 
in the Census Bureau’s IDS study, as the information may not 
encompass all resources spent on indigent defense. In addition, as 
this report focuses only on state government indigent defense 
expenditures, these data cannot be used to compare spending on 
indigent defense and prosecution.

Comparing total indigent defense 
expenditures and spending by public 
defender offices
***************************************

Fiscal year 2008 data from the Census Bureau’s Indigent Defense 
Services (IDS) study were compared to calendar year 2007 data from 
the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) Census of Public Defender 
Offices (CPDO), which collected office-level data from 
approximately 950 publicly funded public defender offices located 
in 49 states and the District of Columbia. ***Footnote 1 In 2007, 
Maine did not have a publicly funded public defender office.*** 
The universe included all public defender offices principally 
funded by state or local governments that provided general 
criminal defense services, conflict services, or capital case 
representation.  
  
The CPDO collected operational expenditure data for the 
government-funded public defender offices, which represented one 
component of total indigent defense system. In comparison, the IDS 
study by the Census Bureau consisted of all spending on indigent 
defense, including contract attorneys, assigned counsel, and 
public defender office expenditures.

The CPDO and IDS studies differed in other ways. The CPDO only 
contained operational expenditures, while the IDS study also 
included capital outlay, generally a small percentage of spending 
on indigent defense. The CPDO reported on calendar year 2007, 
while the Census Bureau’s IDS study collected data for fiscal year 
2008, which included some of calendar year 2007.***Footnote 2 The 
degree to which CY 2007 expenditures was included in a state’s FY 
2008 expenditures depended on the start of a state’s fiscal year, 
which varies by state.***

Among the 22 states classified as state-administered in the CPDO, 
state government expenditures for calendar year 2007 for (14) 
states were within 10% of expenditures from the Census FY 2008 
data.***Footnote 3In the upcoming BJS 2013 National Survey of 
Indigent Defense, 29 states are classified as state-administered. 
*** Of the remaining seven states, four states contained 17% to 
50% more expenditures than in the Census Bureau’s IDS study, and 
three states had 50% more expenditures in the IDS study than the 
CPDO (table 3).

Methodology
*************

The data used for this report and in the Census Bureau study were 
extracted from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State 
Government Finances for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. This 
report includes state government indigent defense expenditures and 
total judicial-legal expenditures compiled by U.S. Census Bureau 
representatives. Data were collected from government audits, 
budgets, and other financial reports. Differences in functional 
responsibilities from state to state may prohibit the 
comparability of expenditure data across all jurisdictions, and 
caution should be exercised when comparing government 
expenditures. For more detailed information on the functional 
responsibilities by state, see the previously referenced Census 
Bureau study, Indigent Defense Services in the United States, 
FY 2008–2012, (NCJ 246683, BJS web, July 2014).

Adjusting for Inflation
*************************

Government expenditures for fiscal years preceding 2012 were 
inflation adjusted to 2012 dollars, as is standard for state 
government spending. Annual chain-type price indices for gross 
domestic product were employed as divisors, and unadjusted 
expenditures were employed as dividends to produce inflation 
adjusted expenditures in 2012 dollars.

The U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis, 
developed the price indices used in all inflation adjustments, 
as published through their interactive data tool 
(http://www.bea.gov/iTable/index_nipa.cfm). (See Table 1.1.4, 
Price Indexes for Gross Domestic Product, March 27, 2014.)

Imputation
************

For 2008 and 2010, expenditure data for Georgia were only 
available for total indigent defense expenditures. Totals for 
direct and intergovernmental expenditures for Georgia for those 
2 years were imputed by taking the average share for each category 
for 2009, 2011, and 2012, and applying it to 2008 and 2010.
Expenditures for California were compiled using the State of 
California Governor’s Budget. However, only partial indigent 
defense expenditure information was available; therefore, 
California’s expenditures are likely an underestimate.  Census 
Bureau data from Florida could not be fully validated. These 
states’ data were used to impute national totals. For FY 2009, 
Tennessee State Budget Publications were used to provide data for 
imputation to national totals.

Terms and definitions
**********************

Expenditures--external cash payments made from any source of 
funds, including any payments financed from borrowing, fund 
balances, intergovernmental revenue, and other current revenue.

Intergovernmental transfers--the sum of payments made from one 
government entity to another, including grants-in-aid, shared 
revenues, payments in lieu of taxes, and amounts for services 
performed by one government for another on a reimbursable or cost-
sharing basis (e.g., payments by one government to another for 
boarding prisoners). Excludes amounts paid to other governments 
for purchase of commodities, property, or utility services.

Direct expenditures--all expenditures except those classified as 
intergovernmental. Includes direct current expenditures (e.g., 
salaries, wages, fees, and commissions and purchases of supplies, 
materials, and contractual services) and capital outlays (e.g., 
construction and purchase of equipment, land, and existing 
structures). Note that capital outlays are included for the year 
in which the direct expenditure was made, regardless of how the 
funds were raised (e.g., bond issue) or when they were paid back.

Indigent defense services--the provision of legal services to 
individuals accused of crimes who cannot afford an attorney.
