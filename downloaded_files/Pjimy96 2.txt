Prisons --

* Between July 1, 1995, and June 30, 1996, the Nation's prison
population grew by 5.3%, less than the average annual growth of
7.7% since 1990.

* Four States had 12-month growth rates of more than 14.0% --
Nebraska, Montana,  North Carolina, and Oregon.  The District of
Columbia (down 6.9%), New Hampshire (-0.7%), and Connecticut (-0.2%)
recorded declines. 

*At midyear 1996 there were an estimated 420 prison inmates per
100,000 U.S. residents-- up from 292 at yearend 1990. 

Jails--

* On June 28, 1996, an estimated 518,492 inmates were held in
the Nation's local jails, up from 507,044 at midyear 1995.

*The 12-month increase of 2.3% in the jail population was
significantly below the average annual increase of 4.2% since
1990.

*  In 1996 jails reported their lowest occupancy rates in 12
years.  At midyear, jails were  operating at 8% below their
rated capacity (562,020).  

* Since 1990 the number of jail inmates per 100,000 U.S.
residents has risen from 163 to 196.

At midyear 1996 an estimated 1,630,940 persons were incarcerated
in the Nation's prisons and jails.  Federal and State prison
authorities and local jail authorities held in their custody 615
persons per 100,000 U.S. residents.  Prisoners in the custody 
of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal
Government accounted for two-thirds of the incarcerated
population (1,112,448 inmates).  The other third were held in
local jails (518,492).

On June 30, 1996, 1,164,356 prisoners were under Federal or
State jurisdiction (includes prisoners in custody and persons
under the legal authority of a prison system but who are held
outside its facilities).  The total increased 5.3% from midyear
1995.  The States and the District of Columbia added 54,549
prisoners; the Federal system, 4,256.

Local jail authorities held or supervised an estimated 591,469
offenders.  Twelve percent of these offenders (72,977) were
supervised outside jail facilities in programs such as com-
munity service, work release, weekend reporting, electronic
monitoring, and other alternative programs.


******************************************
Over 1.6 million inmates were held 
in the Nation's prisons and local jails
******************************************

At midyear 1996 an estimated 1,112,448 inmates were in the
custody of State and Federal prison authorities, and 518,492
inmates were in the custody of local jail authorities.  These
data were collected in the 1996 National Prisoner Statistics
(NPS) program and the 1996 Annual Survey of Jails.

The total incarcerated population increased 4.4% from 12 months
prior.  Since midyear 1995 the number of inmates in State and
Federal prisons increased 5.5%, and the number held in local
jails increased 2.3%.  

Between yearend 1985 and midyear 1996, the incarcerated
population has grown on average 7.8% annually.   During this
period the Federal and State prison populations and the local
jail population have grown at an average annual rate of 9.5%,
8.1%, and 6.9%, respectively.

In the previous 12 months the number of inmates in the Nation's
prisons and jails rose an estimated 69,104 inmates or 1,329
inmates per week.  Since 1990 the total custody population has
risen more than 482,200 inmates, the equivalent of 1,686 inmates
per week.  

Relative to the number of U.S. residents, the rate of
incarceration in 1996 was 615 inmates per 100,000 U.S.
residents--up from 461 per 100,000 in 1990.  At midyear 1996, 1
in every 163 U.S. residents were incarcerated.

In every year since 1990 the State and Federal prison population
has grown faster than the local jail population.  At midyear
1996 the Nation's jails held 32% of all inmates in custody, down
from 35% in 1990.

********************************************
The number of inmates under State or
Federal jurisdiction rose 5.3% 
*******************************************

Between July 1, 1995, and June 30, 1996, the number of inmates
under State jurisdiction grew by 5.4% and the number under
Federal jurisdiction by 4.3%).  Compared to the previous
12-month period ending June 30, 1995, the growth rates declined,
down from 9.2% among State inmates and 6.1% for Federal inmates. 

In absolute numbers, the total increase of 58,805 prison inmates
between July 1, 1995, and June 30, 1996, was appreciably smaller
than the increase of  90,881 recorded in the previous 12-month
period and below the annual average growth (66,745) during the
previous 5 years.

Thirty-nine percent of the growth in the prison populations
during the 12 months ending June 30, 1996,  was accounted for by
California (10,954), the Federal system (4,256), Pennsylvania
(4,095), and North Carolina (3,853).  During this  12-month
period, the total prison population increased at least 10% in 13
States.   Nebraska reported the largest  increase (16.0%),
followed by Montana (15.2%), North Carolina (14.4%), Oregon
(14.1%), Wisconsin (13.9%), and Pennsylvania (13.7%). 

Two States and the District of Columbia experienced a decline in
their prison population.  The District of Columbia had the
largest decline, -6.9%; followed by New Hampshire, -0.7%, and
Connecticut, -0.2%.

*****************************************
Rates of prison incarceration rise
*****************************************

The incarceration rate of State and Federal prisoners sentenced
to more than a year reached 420 per 100,000 U.S. residents on
June 30, 1996.  Texas had the highest rate of incarceration (659
sentenced prisoners per 100,000 State residents), followed by
Louisiana (611 per 100,000), Oklahoma (580), and South Carolina
(540).  Three States--North Dakota (90), Minnesota (108), and
Maine (112--had rates that were less than a third of the
national rate.  The District of Columbia, a wholly urban
jurisdiction, held 1,444 sentenced prisoners per 100,000
residents at midyear 1996.

Since 1990 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000 residents
has risen by more than 40%, increasing from 292 to 420.  During
this period prison incarceration rates rose the
most in the South (from 316 to 487) and West (from 277 to 375). 
The rate in the Northeast rose from 232 to 306, and the rate in
the Midwest from 239 to 318.  The number of sentenced Federal
prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents increased from 20 to 33
over the same period.

**************************************
Female prisoner population grew 
at faster pace
****************************************

During the 12 months ending June 30, 1996, the number of women
under the jurisdiction of State and Federal prison authorities
grew from 69,161 to 73,607, an increase of 6.4%.  The number of
men rose 5.2%, from 1,036,390 to 1,090,749.  At midyear 1996
women accounted for 6.3% of all prisoners nationwide, up from
4.1% in 1980 and 5.7% in 1990.   

Relative to the number of men and women in the U.S. resident
population, the incarceration rate was more than 16 times higher
for men than for women.  On June 30, 1996, the rate for inmates
serving a sentence of more than a year was 809 sentenced males
per 100,000 U.S. male residents, compared to 50 females per
100,000 female residents.

***************************************
At midyear the Nation's jails 
supervised 591,469 offenders 
****************************************

On June 28, 1996, an estimated 591,469 offenders were held in or
supervised by the Nation's local jails.  Jail authorities
supervised 12% of these offenders (72,977) in 
alternative programs outside the jail facilities.  An estimated
518,492 offenders were housed in local jails.

As defined in this report, jails are locally-operated
correctional facilities that confine persons before or after
adjudication.  Inmates sentenced to jail usually have a sentence
of a year or less, but jails also incarcerate persons in a wide
variety of other categories.  

For the first time in 1995 the  Annual Survey of Jails obtained
counts of the number of offenders under community supervision. 
Respondents were asked if their jail jurisdiction operated any
community-based programs and how many persons participated in
them.  Offenders under the supervision of a probation, parole,
or other correctional agency were excluded from these counts. 
Because jail authorities reported offenders in treatment
programs administered by the jail
jurisdiction in 1996, it is difficult to compare totals with
those in 1995. (See Methodology.)

Among persons under community supervision by jail staff in 1996,
slightly less than half were required to perform community
service (17,410) or to participate in an alternative work
program (14,469).  More than a fifth were in a weekend reporting
program (16,336). An estimated 10,425 offenders under jail
supervision were in a drug, alcohol, mental health, or other
medical treatment program.  Another 7,480 offenders were under
home detention with electronic monitoring.

Jail population grew 2.3% 
during 12-month period
*********************************

Between July 1, 1995, and June 28, 1996, the number of persons
held in local jail facilities grew 2.3% -- from 507,044 to
518,492.  The 12-month increase was much lower than the 4.2%
increase in the previous 12-month period ending June 30, 1995,
and about a third the annual average since 1985.

Since 1985 the Nation's jail population has nearly doubled on a
per capita basis.  During this period the number of jail inmates
per 100,000 residents rose from 108 to 196.  Including offenders
under community supervision by jail authorities, the rate
totaled 223 offenders per 100,000 U.S. residents at midyear 1996.

An estimated 8,100 persons under  age 18 were housed in adult
jails on June 28, 1996.  Over two-thirds of these young inmates
had been convicted or were being held for trial as adults in
criminal court.  (See Methodology) for changes in the definition
of juvenile.) 

The average daily population for the year ending June 30, 1996,
was 515,432, an increase of 1.1% from 1995.

***************************************
Characteristics of jail inmates
changed little
***************************************

Male inmates made up 89% of the local jail inmate population at
midyear 1996, nearly 3 percentage points lower than at midyear
1985.  On average, the female jail population has grown 10.2%
annually since 1985, while the male inmate population hasgrown
annually by 6.1%.  On June 28, 1996, local jails held nearly 1
in every 207 adult men and 1 in 1,828 women.

At midyear 1996 a majority of local jail inmates were black or
Hispanic.   White non-Hispanics made up 41.6% of the jail
population; black non-Hispanics, 41.1%; Hispanics, 15.6%; and
other races (Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and
Alaska Natives), 1.7%.


Relative to their number of U.S. residents, black non-Hispanics
were 6 times more likely than white non-Hispanics, over twice as
likely as Hispanics, and over 8 times more likely than persons
of other races to have been held in a local jail on June 30,
1996.

*********************************************

About half of all adults under jail supervision 
were convicted
--------------------------------------------

On June 28, 1996, an estimated  48.8% of all adults under
supervision by jail authorities had been convicted on their
current charge.  An estimated 284,200 of the 582,300 adults
under jail supervision were serving a sentence in jail, awaiting
sentencing, or serving a sentence in an alternative program
outside a jail facility.

-------------------------------------------
At midyear 1996, 92% of  jail 
capacity was occupied
-------------------------------------------

At midyear 1996 the rated capacity of the Nation's local jails
totaled an estimated 562,020, an increase of 16,257 in 12
months.  Rated capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates
allocated by State or local rating officials to each jail
facility.  The growth in jail capacity during the 12-month 
period ending on June 30, 1996, was smaller than in any previous
12-month period since 1987. 

As of June 30, 1996, 92% of the local jail capacity was
occupied.  As a ratio of all inmates housed in jail facilities
to total capacity, the percentage occupied increased
considerably after 1983, reaching a record 108% in 1989 and then
falling to 92% in 1996.  Since 1990 rated capacity has risen
nearly 173,000 beds, while the number of nmates held in jail
facilities has increased approximately 113,200.

Jail jurisdictions with the largest average daily populations
reported the highest occupancy rates.  At midyear 1996 occupancy
was 96% of rated capacity in jail jurisdictions with an average
daily population of 1,000 or more inmates, compared to 71% in
those with fewer than 50 inmates.

The 25 largest jail jurisdictions housed 
more than a quarter of all jail inmates
--------------------------------------------

In 1996 the Nation's 25 largest jail jurisdictions accounted for
27% of all jail inmates.  The jurisdictions were in 12 States: 
7 in California; 5 in Florida; 4 in Texas; and 1 each in New
York, Illinois, Louisiana, Arizona, Tennessee, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

The 2 jurisdictions with the most inmates, New York City and Los
Angeles County, together held more than 38,500 inmates, or 7% of
the national total.

Overall, the 25 largest jurisdictions at midyear 1996 held
142,114 inmates--a total virtually unchanged from a year earlier
(142,077).  A total of 12 jurisdictions reported increases in
their populations; 13 reported decreases.

Philadelphia City and Dallas County, Texas, (both up 12%) and
New York City (up 10%) reported the largest increases among the
25 largest jail jurisdictions.  Three jurisdictions reported
declines of more than 10% -- Tarrant County, Texas, (down 25%),
Harris County, Texas, (-13%), and Baltimore City (-12%).

As a ratio of all inmates housed in jail facilities to total
capacity, jails in Orange County, California,  had the highest percentage occupied
(139%), followed by jails in San Diego County, California,
(119%), and Milwaukee (117%).  Jail facilities in Tarrant County
(69%) and Duval County, Florida, (72%) had the lowest percentage
occupied at midyear 1996.

Methodology
**********************

National Prisoner Statistics (NPS)
----------------------------------------
The Bureau of Justice Statistics, with the U.S. Bureau of the
Census as its collection agent, obtains yearend and midyear
counts of prisoners from departments of correction in each of
the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Bureau
of Prisons.  In an effort to collect comparable data from all
jurisdictions, NPS distin- guishes between prisoners in custody 
from those under jurisdiction.  To have custody of a prisoner, a
State must hold that person in one of its facilities.  To have
jurisdiction, a State has legal authority over the prisoner. 
Prisoners under a State's jurisdiction may be in the custody of
a local jail, another State's prison, or other correctional
facility.  Some States are unable to provide both custody and
jurisdiction counts.  (See National Prisoner Statistics
jurisdiction notes.)

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in locally
administered confinement facilities who are under the
jurisdiction of local authorities.  NPS counts include all
inmates in State-operated facilities in Alaska, Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which have combined
jail-prison systems.

Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ)
--------------------------------

In each of the 4 years between the full censuses, a survey of
jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the
Nation's jails and the inmates housed in these jails.  The 1996
ASJ is the 12th such survey in a series begun in 1982.  The
reference date for the 1996 survey was June 28.

Based on information from the 1993 Census of Jails, a sample of
jail jurisdictions was selected for the 1994-96 surveys.  A
jurisdiction is a county (parish in Louisiana) or municipal
government that administers one or more local jails.  The sample
included all jails in 795 selected jail jurisdictions
and 25 multi-jurisdiction jails.  A multi-jurisdiction jail is
one in which two or more jurisdictions have a formal agreement
to operate the facility. 

In drawing the sample, jail jurisdictions were first stratified
into two groups:  single-jurisdiction jails and
multi-jurisdiction jails.  All of the multi-jurisdiction jails
were included in the survey.  The remaining jurisdictions were
then further stratified into two groups:  jurisdictions with
jails authorized to hold juveniles and jurisdictions with jails
holding adults only.  Jurisdictions were then selected based on
the average daily population in the 1993 census.

All jails in 204 jurisdictions were automatically included if in
1993 the jurisdiction held juveniles and had an average daily
population of 250 or more inmates or if it held only adults and
had an average population of 500 or more.  The other
jurisdictions (591) were then selected based on stratified
probability sampling.

Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires.  After followup
phone calls to nonrespondents, the response rate for the survey
was 100%.



Sampling error
-------------------
Survey estimates have an associated sampling error because 
not all jurisdictions were contacted for the survey.  
Estimates based on the sample survey may differ somewhat 
from the results of conducting a complete census.

Different samples could yield somewhat different results. 
Standard error is a measure of the variation among the estimates
from all possible samples, stating the precision with which an
estimate from a particular sample approximates the average of
all possible samples.  The estimated rela-tive sampling error
for the total number of persons under the jurisdiction of jail
authorities of 591,469 on June 28, 1996, was 0.80%; for persons
held in the custody of jail authorities of 518,492, was 0.59%.  (See
appendix table.)

Measuring confinement status
------------------------------

For the first time in 1995 the ASJ obtained separate counts 
of the total number of offenders underjail supervision, those 
held in jail facilities and thosesupervised outside jail facilities. 
Previous surveys and censuses included a small but unknown
number of offenders under community supervision.  To estimate
the percentage change from1994 to 1995 in the jail population, the 
1995 survey included acount of inmates held at midyear 1994.

In the 1996 survey the number of persons supervised outside a
jail facility included for the first time persons under drug,
alcohol, mental health, or other medical treatment.  Comparison
with 1995 estimates should exclude these persons.



Juveniles
----------

State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be
incarcerated in adult jails under a variety of circumstances. 
Because of the differing statutes and practices, however,
accurate and comparable data on juveniles are difficult to
collect.  

Beginning in 1994 the ASJ provided estimates of the total number
of jail inmates under age 18, the number held as adults, and the
number held as juveniles.  New sampling procedures were also
introduced in 1994 to minimize the standard errors of these
estimates.  By stratifying jurisdictions based on the authority
to house juveniles, the precision of the juvenile counts was
improved.

jurisdiction notes 
************************************* 

Alaska--Prisons and jails form one integrated system.  All NPS
data include both jail and prison populations.

Arizona--Population counts are based on custody data.

California--Population counts include civil narcotic addict
commitments, county diagnostic cases, Federal and other States'
inmates, Youth Authority commitments, and safekeepers.  

Population counts exclude 1,384 persons held in Youth Authority
facilities who are under the jurisdiction of the Department of
Corrections.

Colorado--Population counts for "Inmates with over 1 year
maximum sentence" include an undetermined number of "Inmates
with a maximum sentence of 1 year or less."

Connecticut--Prisons and jails form one integrated system.  All
NPS data include both jail and prison populations.

Delaware--Prisons and jails form one integrated system.  All NPS
data include both jail and prison populations.

District of Columbia--Prisons and jails form one integrated
system.  All NPS data include both jail and prison populations.

Inmates given partially suspended sentences (part served in
prison, part under probation) are included with the "Inmates
with over 1 year maximum sentence" only if the prison portion of
the sentence exceeds 1 year.  As a result, the "Inmates with
over 1 year maximum sentence" populations are understated and
the "Inmates with a year or less maximum sentence" are
overstated.

Florida--Population counts are based 
on custody data.

Georgia--Population counts are based on custody data.

Population counts exclude an undetermined number of inmates
housed in local jails, awaiting pick-up.

Hawaii--Prisons and jails form one integrated system.  All NPS
data include both jail and prison populations.

Illinois--Population counts are based 
on custody data.

Population counts for "Inmates with over 
1 year maximum sentence" include an 
undetermined number of inmates with a sentence of 1 year.

Iowa--Population counts are based on custody data.

Maine--Sentence length classifications are based on the
controlling offense.  

Inmates with multiple sentences are included in the category in
which their most serious offense belongs.

Maryland--While population totals are actual manual counts, the
breakdowns for sentence length are estimates extracted from the
actual sentence length breakdowns of the automated data system
applied to the manual data.

Massachusetts--Population totals are actual counts; however, the
male/female sentence length breakdowns are estimates believed to
be within 0.1% of the actual breakdowns.

By law, offenders may be sentenced to terms of up to 2« years in
locally-operated jails and correctional institutions.  Such
populations are excluded from the State count but are included
in published population counts and rates for local jails and
correctional institutions.

Population counts may include a small, but undetermined number
of inmates who were remanded to court, transferred to the
custody of another State, Federal, or locally-operated system,
and subsequently released.

Counts include an estimated 63 inmates housed in Massachusetts
Department of Correction facilities on behalf of other States
(59) or Federal authorities (4).  

The unsentenced inmate custody count includes inmates awaiting
trial and civil commitments housed in State facilities.

The unsentenced inmate jurisdiction count includes inmates
housed in State facilitiesawaiting trial and civil commitments 
and 171 males awaiting trial for the State housed in county facilities.

The unsentenced inmate jurisdiction count includes inmates
housed in local jails because of overcrowding.  These types of
inmates were excluded in 1995.  

Michigan--Population counts are based on custody data.

Montana--The jurisdiction count includes 200 males and 3 females
being held in county jails because of overcrowding.

New Jersey--New Jersey reported no inmates with sentences of
less than 1 year because its Department of Corrections has no
jurisdiction over these types of inmates.  Counts for inmates
with over 1 year maximum sentence(s) include inmates with a
sentence of exactly 1 year.

North Carolina--Inmates given partially suspended sentences
(part served in prison, part under probation) are included with
the "Inmates with over 1 year maximum sentence" only if the
prison portion of the sentence exceeds 1 year.  As a result, the
"Inmates with over 1 year maximum sentence" populations are
understated and the "Inmates with a year or less maximum
sentence" are overstated.

While population totals are actual counts, the breakdowns for
sentence length are estimates believed to be accurate within 1%
of the actual numbers.

Ohio--Population counts for "Inmates with over 1 year maximum
sentence" include an undetermined number of "Inmates with a
sentence of 1 year or less."

Oklahoma--Population counts for "Inmates with over 1 year
maximum sentence" may include a small undetermined number of
inmates with a sentence of 1 year or less.

Oregon--nmates with a sentence of 1 year or less includes a few
inmates whose complete sentence information has not been
received from the courts.

Rhode Island--Prisons and jails form one integrated system.  All
NPS data include both jail and prison populations.

Inmates given partially suspended sentences (part served in
prison, part under probation) are included with the "Inmates
with over 1 year maximum sentence" only if the prison portion of
the sentence exceeds 1 year.  As a result, the "Inmates with
over 1 year maximum sentence" populations are understated and
the "Inmates with a year or less maximum sentence" are
overstated.

Included in the counts for unsentenced 

Inmates are 14 males and 1 female who have civil commitments for
nonpayment of child support.


Tennessee-- Population counts exclude 3,281 felons sentenced to
serve their time in local jails.  The State pays to house these
3,281 felons, but the local court maintains jurisdiction.

Texas--Counts for inmates with over 1 year maximum sentence and
inmates with a sentence of 1 year or less do not match counts
reported on the 1995 NPS-1 because of an inability to separate
these populations for inflow and outflow distributions.  

Vermont--Prisons and jails form one 
integrated system.  All NPS data include both jail and prison
populations.  

Population counts are based on custody data.

June 30, 1996, data are estimated using the proportions in the
December 31, 1995, data.

The Vermont Department of Corrections has recently undergone an
extensive restructuring.  They have initiated two types of
supervisory units.  The first is the "Correctional Reparative
Services Unit" (CRSU) that monitors offenders sentenced to a
community restitution in lieu of incarceration.  This CRSU
supervises mostly low risk populations with nonviolent crimes
which may be felonies or misdemeanors.  The other unit is the
"Community Corrections Service Center."   This unit supervises
offenders who are under "Supervised Community Sentence" or
"Pre-approved Furlough." 

The numbers presented in these tables represent only offenders
who are incarcerated in the Vermont Department of Corrections.

Virginia--Inmates with sentences of 1 year or less will increase
because of the abolition of parole for crimes committed on
January 1, 1995, or more recently and the concurrent imposition
of sentencing guidelines.  New sentencing guidelines are based
on time served previously rather than actual sentence given
previously, hence the new law sentences are most likely to be
less than old law sentences.  

Wisconsin--Wisconsin could not determine the sentence length for
inmates included in the unsentenced category.  It is probable
that these inmates have sentences of at least a year and a day.

The jurisdiction totals do not include 1,304 men and 229 women
under the supervision of the Division of Intensive Sanctions in
the community.
