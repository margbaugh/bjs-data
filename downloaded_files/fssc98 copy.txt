Highlights

*  In 1998 State courts convicted 927,717
adults of a felony.  Federal courts 
convicted 50,494, bringing the combined 
U.S. total to 978,211. State courts 
accounted for 95% of the national total.

*  Drug offenders were 33.9% of felons 
convicted in State courts in 1998. Property 
offenders made up 30.5%; violent offenders, 
17.8%; and those convicted of weapon 
offenses and other nonviolent crimes made 
up the rest (17.8%).

*  State courts sentenced 44% of convicted
felons to a State prison, 24% to a local 
jail, and 32% to straight probation with no 
jail or prison time to serve.

*  State courts sentenced to death 1% of
those convicted of murder.  

*  The average sentence to local jail 
was 6 months.  The average probation 
sentence was 3 years and 4 months. A 
fine was imposed on 21% of convicted 
felons, restitution on 13%, community 
service on 6%, and treatment was 
ordered for 6%.

*  The average sentence length to State
prison has decreased since 1990 (63 
years versus almost 5 years), but felons 
sentenced in 1998 were likely to serve 
more of that sentence before release 
(33% versus 47%).  

*  Guilty pleas accounted for 94% of 
felony convictions in 1998.  Trial 
convictions accounted for the remaining 
6%.    

*  Nationally, of the felons convicted 
in 1998, 55% were white, 44% were black,
and 1% were other races.  The average
age of felons convicted in State courts 
in 1998 was 31.

*  Females account for an increasing 
portion of felons convicted in State 
courts. In 1990, females were 14% of 
convicted felons; in 1998, 17%.

*  In 1998 the average time from arrest 
to sentencing was just over 7 months 
(214 days).
-------------------------------------------------------

In 1998 State courts convicted nearly
930,000 adults of a felony.  Forty-four
percent of convicted felons were sentenced
to a State prison, and 24% were sentenced
to a local jail (usually for a year or 
less). The remaining 32% were sentenced 
to straight probation.  These findings 
come from a survey conducted every 2 
years and is the Nation's sole source of 
statistical information on the sentences 
felons receive in State courts nationwide.

National Judicial Reporting Program

The "National Judicial Reporting Program"
(NJRP) compiles detailed information on
the sentences and characteristics of
convicted felons.  Previous national
surveys of felony sentencing in State
courts were conducted in 1986, 1988, 
1990, 1992, 1994, and 1996. ***Footnote

The 1998 survey was based on a  sample
of 344 counties (out of the Nation's
approximately 3,100 counties) selected 
to be nationally representative.  The 
344 included the District of Columbia 
and at least 1 county from every State 
except, by chance, Delaware and Montana. 
Among the 344 sampled counties, 2 
sentenced no felons during 1998. The 
1998 survey excluded Federal courts 
and those State or local courts that 
did not adjudicate adult felony cases.
 
According to the BJS Federal Justice
Statistics Program, Federal courts
convicted 50,494 persons of a felony 
in 1998 (see page 3).***Footnote 
2: By comparison, the State court in 
1 county, Los Angeles, accounted for 
about 47,000 felony conviction in 
1998.***  That number represents 5% 
of the combined State and Federal 
total number of felony convictions 
during 1998.

The 1998 survey included only offenses
that State penal codes defined as 
felonies. Felonies are widely defined 
as crimes with the potential of being 
punished by more than 1 year in prison. 

Felony conviction offenses

A total of 927,717 persons were convicted
of a felony in State courts  in 1998,
including 164,600 (or 17.8% of the 
total) for a violent felony; 283,000 
(30.5%) for the property offenses of 
burglary, larceny, fraud, and forgery; 
314,600 (33.9%) for drug offenses; 
and 31,900 (3.4%) for weapon offenses.  
The remaining 133,600 (14.4%) consisted 
of persons convicted of nonviolent 
offenses such as receiving stolen 
property and escaping custody. 
Marijuana trafficking convictions 
were 2.5% of the conviction total, 
and marijuana possession convictions 
were 3.6% of the total. 

Sentences for felonies

In 1998, 68% of all convicted felons 
were sentenced to a period of 
confinement   44% to State prisons and 
24% to local jails. Jail sentences are 
for short-term confinement (usually 
for a year or less) in a county or city  
facility, while prison sentences are for 
long-term confinement (usually for over 
a year) in a State facility.  An estimated 
32% of all convicted felons were sentenced 
to straight probation with no jail or 
prison time to serve.

-----------------------------------------
Comparison of felony convictions in State
and Federal courts, 1998

The vast majority of all felony convic-
tions in the United States occur in 
State courts. Overall, Federal courts 
account for a relatively small number. 

*  In 1998 Federal courts convicted 
50,494 persons of a violent, property, 
drug, or other felony.  State courts 
convicted 927,717 bringing the combined 
U.S. total to 978,211 felons convicted.  
Federal courts accounted for 5% of the 
national total.

*  Violent offenses comprised 5% of 
felony convictions in Federal courts 
but 18% of those in State courts.

*  In 1998, 82% of felons convicted 
in Federal courts were sentenced to
incarceration.  The remaining 18% 
received probation.  State courts 
sentenced 68% of felons to incarcera-
tion (prison or jail) and 32% to 
straight probation.  

*  The average Federal incarceration
sentence was just over 5 years in 
1998. By contrast, State incarceration 
sentences (prison or jail) had an 
average of 3 years and 3 months.  

*  Federal drug offenders received
incarceration terms that were about 
twice the length of drug offenders in 
State courts (6 years and 7 months 
versus 2 years and 7 months).

*  In 1998 Federal offenders released 
from prison served an average of 91% 
of their prison term before release.  
Felons convicted in State courts served 
a significantly smaller proportion of 
their total incarceration sentence.  For 
instance, State prisoners (not including 
felons sentenced to jail) served about 
47% of their total prison sentence in 
1998. 
 
Source of Federal data: Federal statis-
tics shown in the above table are from 
the same database that was used to create
tables 5.1 and 5.2 of the BJS publication
Compendium of Federal Statistics, 1998
(NCJ 180258).  Tables 5.1 and 5.2 figures
differ from the above figures because of
differences in how offenses were defined.
------------------------------------------------

Sentence length

An offender convicted of multiple 
offenses receives a sentence for 
each offense.  If multiple prison 
sentences are imposed, the court 
then decides whether the convicted
felon will serve the sentences 
concurrently (at the same time) or 
consecutively (one after another).  
For persons with consecutive sentences, 
the total time is the sum of the 
sentence lengths, and for persons 
with concurrent sentences, the total 
time is the same as the longest 
sentence.  For persons convicted 
of a single offense, the total 
time refers simply to the sentence 
for that offense.  Whenever an 
offender received a prison sentence 
range, such as 5 to 10 years, the 
total time refers to the maximum.

For the Nation in 1998, the mean 
felony sentence to incarceration 
(prison or jail) was 3 years and 
3 months; the median was 1 year 
and 6 months.

State prison sentences

In 1998 the mean length of sentences 
to State prison was almost 5 years; 
the median term was 3 years.  The 
mean prison sentence for murder and
nonnegligent manslaughter was nearly 
22 years; the median was 25 years. 
Life sentences are rare among 
convicted felons, whether measured as 
a percentage of all sentences (0.5%) 
or as a percentage just of prison 
sentences (1.1%).  However, among 
persons convicted of murder or
nonnegligent manslaughter, 26% were
sentenced to life in prison, and 1% 
were sentenced to death.  

Among persons convicted of murder 
or nonnegligent manslaughter and 
sentenced to prison, 27% were 
sentenced to life in prison, and 1% 
were sentenced to death. When 
considering those convicted of 
murder specifically (not including 
nonnegligent manslaughter), 32% were 
sentenced to life, and 1% were 
sentenced to death.  Again, among 
those convicted of murder specifically 
and sentenced to prison, 34% were 
sentenced to life in prison, and 1% 
were sentenced to death. ***Footnote 
3: Not all persons convicted of murder 
were subject to the death penalty.  
Thirty-eight States authorized the 
death penalty in 1998. Within those 
38, only certain types of murder were 
capital offenses.***

Jail and probation sentences

Among felons who received a sentence 
to local jail in 1998, the mean sentence 
was 6 months, and the median was 4 months.
Probation sentences had a mean length of
3 years and 4 months and a median of 3
years.

Estimated State prison time to be
served 

The amount of time felons actually serve 
in prison is typically a fraction of the 
total sentence received. Two primary 
reasons explain the difference between 
sentences received and time served: 

In States that impose indeterminate
sentences, a judge specifies the minimum
and/or maximum sentence length, but a
parole board decides when the prisoner 
will actually be released.

In most but not all States, prisoners 
gain early release through time credits 
that they receive automatically or that 
are granted to them for good behavior or 
special achievements -- provisions that 
are intended to help correctional 
officials manage institutional 
populations.

For both types of sentence reduction,
released offenders usually serve the
remaining portion of their sentences 
under supervision in the community.  
To calculate time to be served by felons 
sentenced in 1998, the fraction of their 
sentence they might reasonably be expected 
to serve was obtained from records of 
inmates released from prison in a recent 
year. Life sentences and death sentences 
were excluded because it is not possible 
to specify the percentage served. The 
percentage of the sentence that released 
inmates had served was applied to felons 
sentenced to prison in 1998.

Based on data collected by BJS in its
"National Corrections Reporting Program,"
inmates released from prisons in 1998 had
served an average of 47% of their total
sentence in prison.  The percentage of
sentence served ranged from 60% for those 
convicted of weapon offenses to a low of 
40% for those convicted of drug possession.

Applying these percentages to State prison
sentences received in 1998, it is estimated
that felons sentenced in 1998 would serve
just over 2 years, or 47% of their average
5-year prison sentence.  

Since life sentences and death are rare 
for most types of crimes, this method 
gives reasonably sound estimates of 
time to be served for most offenses 
(assuming, among other things, that 
prison release policies applicable to 
persons sentenced in 1998 are not 
markedly different from those governing 
recent releases).  However, life 
sentences and death are not rare for 
murder, though they are rare for 
nonnegligent manslaughter. Consequently, 
time to be served shown for "murder and 
nonnegligent manslaughter" perhaps 
substantially underestimates the amount 
of time all persons convicted of these 
offenses are likely to serve since the 
time only applies to persons not receiving 
a life or death sentence.

Convicted felon populations: 
Sex, race, and age

In 1998 men comprised 48% of adults 
(age 18 or older) in the U.S. population 
but 83% of persons convicted of a felony 
and 90% of persons convicted of a violent 
felony. Whites were 83% of the adult U.S. 
population but 55% of persons convicted 
of a felony and 53% of the persons 
convicted of a violent felony.  
Corresponding figures for blacks were 
12% of the adult U.S. population but 44% 
of convicted felons and 44% of felons 
convicted of a violent crime. The other 
races (American Indians, Alaska Natives, 
Asians, and Pacific Islanders) represented 
5% of the U.S. population but 1% of 
convicted felons and 3% of those convicted 
of a violent crime.

Persons in their twenties represented about
19% of the adult U.S. population but 39%
of convicted felons.  The mean or average
age of felons was 31 years; the median
was 30.

------------------------------------------
Felony convictions and sentences
relative to the number of arrests, 1998

The number of State felony convictions in
1998 was compared to the number of crimes 
reported to police and the number of arrests 
made for these crimes in 1998. Comparisons 
are limited to crimes likely to be felonies.

These aggregate numbers should not be
interpreted as tracking individual cases
through the criminal justice system. 
Nevertheless, the comparisons illustrate
the approximate odds of conviction and a
prison sentence, given an arrest for a
felony.

For example, the FBI reports that in 
1998 almost 15,400 adults were arrested 
for murder (including nonnegligent
manslaughter).  That year, 9,158 persons
were convicted of murder, and 8,609
murderers received a prison sentence.  
For every 100 persons arrested for murder 
in 1998, 60 were convicted and 56 were 
sentenced to prison for that offense. 
Corresponding findings for drug traffickers 
were 68 convictions and 31 prison sentences 
for every 100 arrests.
---------------------------------------

Number of felony 
conviction offenses

At time of sentencing, over three-
quarters of felons sentenced in 1998 
were sentenced for a single felony of-
fense. An estimated 16% were sentenced 
for two felony offenses, and the 
remaining 6% were sentenced for three 
or more.  The number of offenses totaled 
about 1.2 million felony conviction 
offenses for which 927,717 felons were 
convicted and sentenced in 1998.
***Footnote 4: The 1.2 Million figure 
pertains to current, not past, 
convictions.***

The greater the number of felony conviction
offenses, the more severe was the sentence.  
The likelihood of a State prison sentence 
rose from 41% for those convicted of one 
felony to 53% for two felonies and 64% for 
three or more.

The mean sentence to State prison also
increased from just over 4 years for 
those convicted of one felony to a little 
more than 6 years for those convicted 
of two or more.

Method of conviction

Of the 927,717 convicted felons, the 
vast majority -- about 872,000, 
representing 94% of those sentenced for 
a felony in 1998 -- pleaded guilty. The 
rest were found guilty either by a jury 
or by a judge in a bench trial. Persons 
convicted of murder were the least 
likely to have pleaded guilty (55%) and 
the most likely to have been convicted 
by a jury (38%).

In 1998 violent crime accounted for most
jury trials.  Of all jury trial felony 
convictions in 1998, 51% (15,515 cases) 
were for violent crime; 49% (14,966 
cases) were for nonviolent crime. Juries 
convicted 3,471 persons of murder in 1998, 
and 4,898 of aggravated assault. 

Murderers convicted by a jury were the 
most likely to have received a life 
sentence (40%) or the death penalty (3%).

Guilty plea    100     16      1     83
 
Juries accounted for 38% of murder 
convictions but 56% of life and death 
sentences for murder.***Footnote 5: Juries
seldom impose a sentence.  With rare
exception, sentencing in a jury trial is
the responsibility of the judge.***

Case processing time

Mean time from arrest to sentencing in
1998 was slightly over 7 months.  Median
time was just under 5 months. Jury trial 
cases took the most time -- over 12 months 
on average from arrest to sentencing.  
Cases disposed by guilty plea took the 
least time -- just over 7 months on 
average.

Additional penalties

Besides being sentenced to incarceration
or probation, 36% or more of convicted
felons also were ordered to pay a fine, 
pay victim restitution, receive treatment,
perform community service, or comply 
with some other additional penalty (for 
example, undergo house arrest or appear 
periodically for drug testing).  A fine 
was imposed on at least 21% of convicted 
felons. 

Estimates of the percentages of felons 
receiving other penalties are 13% 
restitution, 6% some form of treatment, 
and 6% community service. 

Trends in the United States:
1990 to 1998

Number of convictions increasing 

State courts convicted 927,717 adults 
of a felony in 1998. That total is 12% 
greater than the number convicted in 
1990. The general trend has been upward 
since 1990.

        Number of felony
        convictions
1990        829,344
1992        893,630
1994        872,217
1996        997,970
1998        927,717

Increasing likelihood of arrest leading 
to conviction

The likelihood of a felony arrest leading 
to a felony conviction is approximated by
dividing the number of adult felony
convictions in a year by the number of 
adult felony arrests that year. In 1998, 
for example, robbery convictions totaled
38,784, and robbery arrests totaled 88,356,
indicating about a 44% likelihood of 
conviction for robbery.

Approximate likelihood of felony arrest
leading to felony conviction
                      1990   1994   1998
Murder                 55     65%    60%
Robbery                37     39     44
Aggravated assault     13     14     16
Burglary               38     39     41
Drug trafficking       53     52     68

Although the Nation's annual arrest
statistics do not distinguish felony from
misdemeanor arrests, this method for
estimating the likelihood of conviction 
from aggregate statistics is still valid 
for certain crimes -- such as robbery -- 
that State law always or nearly always 
defines as felonies.

Since 1990 the likelihood of an arrest
leading to a conviction has generally 
risen for all crimes.

Case processing time

Cases took the courts about the same 
time to process in 1990 and 1998. In 
1990 and 1998 the average length of 
time from arrest to sentencing was just 
over 7 months. 

Guilty pleas

An indirect measure of how well courts
keep pace with a growing workload is 
the percentage of cases disposed by 
guilty plea.  Because guilty pleas take 
less time than trials, a rising workload 
might exert pressure on prosecutors and 
judges to dispose of more cases by plea 
rather than trial. The data contain 
evidence of more guilty pleas.  In 1990 
guilty pleas accounted for 91% of all 
felony convictions, and trials accounted 
for the remaining 9%. Corresponding 
figures for 1998 were 94% guilty pleas 
and 6% trials.  Since 1990 guilty pleas 
have accounted for at least 89% of 
felony convictions.

Aging of convicted felons

The average age of the American
population is rising, a trend reflected 
in the changing average age of convicted 
felons. In 1990, persons age 30 or older
comprised 74% of adults (age 18 and older) 
in the U.S. population and accounted for 
42% of persons convicted; in 1998, persons 
age 30 or older comprised 78% of adults 
(age 18 or older) in the U.S. population 
and accounted for 52% of persons convicted.  
The median age of convicted felons was 
28 years in 1990 but 30 years in 1998.  

Changing racial composition of 
convicted felons

Blacks, American Indians, Alaska Natives,
Asians, and Pacific Islanders  comprise 
a growing fraction of the U.S. population
but a decreasing percentage of convicted
felons. In 1990, the races other than
whites were 15% of persons age 18 or
older and 48% of persons convicted of a
felony. In 1998 those same racial groups
accounted for 17% of U.S. adults and 45%
of those convicted.

Unchanged likelihood of prison 

From 1988 to 1994 the percentage 
of felons receiving a State prison 
sentence remained around 45%. In 
1996 the percentage receiving prison 
sentences dropped to 38%.  The 
percentage of felons sent to prison 
returned to about 45% in 1998.

Of all felony offenses, drug trafficking 
had one of the largest decreases in the
percentage sentenced to prison between
1990 and 1998 (from 49% in 1990 to 45%
in 1998).

Shorter imposed prison sentences and 
a growing fraction of sentence served 
before release

Prior to being freed, inmates released 
from State prison in 1990 had served, 
on average, a third of the sentence 
imposed on them by the court. In 1998 
inmates were released after serving 
approximately half of their court-
imposed sentence. While prisoners are 
serving a growing percentage of their 
court-imposed sentence, the average 
court-imposed sentence has been 
decreasing.  

In 1990 the typical felon received a 
6-year sentence and (assuming a person 
sentenced in 1990 will serve the same 
fraction of his/her sentence as was 
typical among persons released in 1990) 
would serve a third of that sentence 
before release, or 2 years. By contrast, 
in 1998 the typical felon received a 5-
year sentence but (assuming a person 
sentenced in 1998 will serve the same 
fraction of his/her sentence as was 
typical among persons released in 1998) 
would serve half of that sentence before 
release, or 2 years and 3 months.

Methodology

Sampling

In 1988 a sample of 300 counties was
drawn for the 1988 NJRP survey. With
little exception, these same 300 
counties were the source of NJRP data 
for 3 subsequent NJRP surveys (1990, 
1992, 1994).  For the 1996 NJRP survey 
a new sample was drawn, consisting 
of 344 counties.  The 344 counties 
included 98 that had been in the NJRP 
sample in the 4 previous surveys (1988, 
1990, 1992, 1994) and 246 that had 
never been in an NJRP sample. The 98 
consisted of 80 counties selected by 
chance alone; plus 18 of the Nation's 
largest counties selected not by 
chance but (given their large 1995 
population size) with certainty. The 
same 344 counties were used for the 
1998 NJRP survey.

The 1998 survey was based on a two-
stage, stratified cluster sampling
design.  In the first stage the 
Nation's 3,195 counties or county 
equivalents were divided into 14 
strata.  Each county was assigned 
to one stratum by meeting the conditions 
for that stratum.

The stratum that a county was assigned
depended on answers to these three
questions:
1. Is the county among the Nation's 75
largest according to 1995 resident
population?
2. In what type of State is the county?  
(A State where data collection is 
generally not costly?  One where data 
collection is generally moderately 
costly?  One where data collection is 
generally very costly?) 
3. What is the size of the county's 
1995 resident population? 

At the second stage of sampling, a 
systematic sample of felons sentenced 
for murder/nonnegligent manslaughter,
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, burglary, felony larceny/
motor vehicle theft, fraud/forgery/
embezzlement, drug trafficking, drug 
possession, weapon offenses, and 
other offenses was selected from each 
county's official records. The total 
sample numbered 446,682 cases.  

Of these, 290,800 cases were in the 
75 largest counties.

Rates at which cases were sampled 
varied by how the data were submitted, 
by stratum and by crime type.
 
Before the sample of cases was drawn,
each felon sentenced in the sampled
county in 1998 was placed into 1 of 
the 11 offense categories identified 
above. If the felon was convicted of 
more than one felony offense, the 
offense category was the most serious 
offense. The hierarchy from most to 
least serious offense was murder, 
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated 
assault, burglary, drug trafficking, 
weapons, forgery/fraud /embezzlement, 
larceny/motor vehicle theft, drug 
possession, and all other felonies.

The hierarchy was determined from an
analysis of two factors that reflect 
how seriously the justice system treats 
different offenses: the sentence length 
imposed and the time actually served in 
prison before release. In general, the 
higher the offense is in the hierarchy, 
the more serious it is in terms of the 
two factors.

Sample selection procedures gave each
sentenced felon a single chance to be 
in the sample.  However, felons who 
appeared in court on more than 1 day 
for different offenses and received a 
sentence at each reappearance had more 
than a single chance.

At the data analysis stage, cases were
aggregated according to their offense
designation at the time of sampling, 
with the single exception of "other 
violent." "Other violent" is a category 
shown in the report's tables, but it 
was not a category at sampling. The 
"other violent" category was formed 
from the sampling category "other 
felonies." That is, after sampling, 
sampled cases designated "other 
felonies" were coded "violent,"
"nonviolent," or "not ascertained," 
based on data available on them. 
Cases coded "not ascertained" were 
rare. For data analysis, cases coded 
"other violent" were removed from the 
"other felonies" category and shown 
separately in the report's tables.  
Additional details on the sampling 
are in the BJS publication Felony 
Sentences in State Courts, 1996 
(NCJ 173939).

Sampling error

NJRP data were obtained from a sample
and not from a complete enumeration;
consequently, they are subject to 
sampling error.  A standard error, 
which is a measure of sampling error, 
is associated with each number in the 
report. In general, if the difference 
between two numbers is at least twice 
the standard error of that difference 
(the criterion used in this report), 
there is at least 95% confidence that 
the two numbers do in fact differ; 
that is, the apparent difference is 
not simply the result of surveying a 
sample rather than the entire 
population.  

National estimates of the number of
convictions for individual crime 
categories and for the aggregate total 
had a coefficient of variation of 3.8%.  
Standard errors for each table in the 
report are available on the Internet:  
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/
fssc98.htm>.  Standard errors did not 
take into account missing data, which 
are sometimes substantial for certain 
tables.

Sources of data

State courts were the source of 
NJRP data for about 61% of the 344 
counties sampled.  For other counties, 
sources included statistical agencies, 
sentencing commissions, department of 
public safety, probation departments, 
state police departments, and department 
of corrections.  Individual-level NJRP 
records were obtained through a variety 
of collection methods, including 
electronically (88% of the counties) 
and manually (12%).

Electronic methods of data submission 
included diskettes, magnetic tape, 
and Internet transmission.  Manual 
methods included photocopies of official 
documents, survey questionnaires 
completed by court officials, and on-
site collections by Census Bureau staff.  
All data were collected by the U.S. 
Bureau of the Census.

Targeted population

The survey targeted and recorded initial
sentences imposed in 1998.  If a sentence
was imposed on one date and then modified 
at a later date, the revision was ignored.  
The survey recorded sentences that were 
actually executed and excluded suspended 
sentences.

Because the year of conviction was not a
defining characteristic, some cases in the
sample were of persons convicted before
1998 but not sentenced until 1998.

In the four counties sampled from Maryland 
and in two other counties - Wood (WI) and 
Mercer (NJ) - it was impractical to target 
sentences in 1998. Cases sampled from 
these counties were all sentenced in 1999.

Note that the 1998 conviction data that
were submitted by two counties - San
Bernardino (CA) and Boulder (CO) - did 
not conform to definitional guidelines. 
Consequently, the 1996 conviction data
that were submitted by San Bernardino 
and Boulder counties for the 1996 survey
were used in their place.
