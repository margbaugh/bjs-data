Jail Inmates in 2015
 
Todd D. Minton and Zhen Zeng, BJS Statisticians

The average daily population (ADP) of jail inmates in 2015 
(721,300) remained stable from 2011 to 2015 after peaking in 2008 
(776,600) (figure 1, table 1). The ADP jail population count is a 
fraction of the number of inmates flowing into jail each year. 
In 2015, there were 10.9 million admissions to jails (table 2). 
From 2008 to 2015, the volume of admissions to jails steadily 
declined. The number of admissions to jail in 2015 was nearly 
15 times the size of ADP in 2015.

The jail incarceration rate—the confined population per 100,000 
U.S. residents—decreased from a peak in 2006 through 2008 (260 
per 100,000) to 230 per 100,000 at midyear 2015. These data are 
based on midyear counts, which includes the number of inmates 
held in custody on the last weekday in June. This was the lowest 
rate since midyear 2000 (220 per 100,000). The adult 
incarceration rate for persons age 18 or older also declined from 
a peak of 340 per 100,000 in 2006 through 2008 to about 300 per 
100,000 each year since 2013.

In addition to tracking the midyear population and the ADP, the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has tracked the confined jail 
population at yearend since 2000. (See Terms and definitions 
textbox.) The jail population goes through seasonal change, 
typically with fewer inmates at yearend than at midyear (about 4% 
lower on average from 2000 to 2015), but the year-to-year changes 
of midyear and yearend population counts have followed a similar 
pattern (not shown). The total number of inmates confined in 
local jails was 693,300 on December 31, 2015.

Terms and definitions
**********************

Adult incarceration rate--The number of adult inmates held in the 
custody of local jails, per 100,000 U.S. residents age 18 or 
older.

Admissions--Persons who are officially booked and housed in jails 
by formal legal document and the authority of the courts or some 
other official agency. Jail admissions include persons sentenced 
to weekend programs and those who are booked into the facility 
for the first time. Excluded from jail admissions are inmates 
reentering the facility after an escape, work release, medical 
appointment or treatment facility appointment, and bail and court 
appearances.

Average daily population--The average is derived by the sum of 
inmates in jail each day for a year, divided by the number of 
days in the year. 

Average annual change--The mean average change across a 12-month 
period. 

Calculating weekly jail turnover rate--This rate is calculated by 
adding average weekly admissions and releases and dividing by the 
average daily population. See Calculating weekly turnover rates 
section for additional information. 

Inmates confined at midyear--The number of inmates held in 
custody on the last weekday in June. 

Inmates confined at yearend--The number of inmates held in 
custody on December 31. This number is typically smaller than the 
number of inmates confined at midyear. 

Jail incarceration rate--The number of inmates held in the 
custody of local jails, per 100,000 U.S. residents. 

Percent of capacity occupied--This percentage is calculated by 
taking the number of inmates (e.g. confined inmate population or 
average daily population) and dividing by the rated capacity. 

Rated capacity--The number of beds or inmates assigned by a 
rating official to a facility, excluding separate temporary 
holding areas. 

Releases--Persons released after a period of confinement (e.g., 
sentence completion, bail or bond releases, other pretrial 
releases, transfers to other jurisdictions, and deaths). Releases 
include those persons who have completed their weekend program 
and who are leaving the facility for the last time. Excluded from 
jail releases are temporary discharges, including work release, 
medical appointment or treatment center, court appearance, 
furlough, day reporting, and transfers to other facilities within 
the jail’s jurisdiction. 

Under jail supervision but not confined--This classification 
includes all persons in community-based programs operated by a 
jail facility. These programs include electronic monitoring, 
house arrest, community service, day reporting, and work 
programs. The classification excludes persons on pretrial release 
and who are not in a community-based program run by the jail, as 
well as persons under supervision of probation, parole or other 
agencies, inmates on weekend programs, and inmates who 
participate in work release programs and return to the jail at 
night.
********************************************************

************************************
Juvenile population in adult jails 
continued to decline
************************************

The juvenile population (those age 17 or younger) in local jails 
continued to decline in 2015, to fewer than 4,000 inmates 
(tables 3 and 4). This was down from a peak of about 7,600 juveniles 
in 2010. Since 2000, at least 8 in 10 juveniles held in local jails 
were on trial or awaiting trial in adult court.

While males accounted for at least 85% of the jail population 
each year since 2000, the female jail population grew from 11% of 
the total jail population in 2000 to more than 14% in 2013 and 
2014. As a result, the female jail incarceration rate increased 
from about 50 per 100,000 female U.S. residents in 2000 to nearly 
70 per 100,000 in 2014. The male incarceration rate remained 
relatively stable since 2000 (about 400 per 100,000 male U.S. 
residents) (not shown).

White inmates accounted for at least 47% of the jail population 
since 2013, up from 42% in 2000. Conversely, the percentage of black 
inmates held in local jails declined from about 40% in 2005 to 
35% in 2014 and 2015. Hispanics represented about 15% of the jail 
population in 2014, unchanged since 2000. American Indian and 
Alaska Native inmates represented a small proportion (about 1%) 
of the jail population, but their number has nearly doubled 
since 2000.

************************************
Nearly 7 in 10 inmates were held in 
jail for a felony offense
************************************

Since 2005, more than 60% of all jail inmates were awaiting court 
action on a current charge. About 4 in 10 inmates were sentenced 
offenders or convicted offenders awaiting sentencing. The growth 
in the overall jail inmate population since 2000 was due to the 
increase in the unconvicted population. Regardless of conviction 
status, about 68% of jail inmates in 2015 were held for a felony 
offense, and the remaining 32% were held for either misdemeanor 
(27%) or other offenses (5%) (not shown).

************************************
Jail jurisdictions with 2,500 or 
more inmates held 21% of the 
population in 2015, down from 25% 
in 2014
************************************

Large jail jurisdictions with 2,500 or more inmates held 21% of the 
population in 2015, down from 25% in 2014 nationwide (table 5). 
In 2015, 1 in 5 inmates were held in 30 jail jurisdictions with an 
ADP of 2,500 or more inmates (not shown). Jail jurisdictions with 
100–249 average daily population held 14% of inmates in 2015, up 
from 12% in 2014. In comparison, jail jurisdictions with an ADP 
of under 100 held less than 10% of the inmate population, but 
accounted for more than half of all jail jurisdictions in 2014 
(57%) and 2015 (56%) (not shown). While the mean ADP of all jail 
jurisdictions decreased from 269 to 253 inmates between 2014 and 
2015, the ADP within jail size categories remained stable.

************************************ 
Bed space increased between 2008 
and 2015, while jail population 
decreased
************************************

The rated capacity in jails reached 904,900 beds at yearend 2015, 
up nearly 47,000 beds since 2010. (figure 2, table 6). Jail 
capacity grew at an annual rate of nearly 2% between midyear 2000 
and yearend 2015. The rated capacity is the maximum number 
of beds or inmates allocated to each jail facility by a rating 
official, excluding separate temporary holding areas. While the 
jail population and rated capacity increased at similar rates 
from 2000 through 2008, the growth rates have diverged since 2008. 
The ADP declined by 7% from 2008 to 2015, while the rated capacity 
increased by 9%. 

Since peaking in 2007 at 95%, the percentage of occupied capacity 
on an average day (the ratio of ADP in a year to rated capacity) 
declined to 80% by yearend 2015. Combined, jail jurisdictions 
holding under 100 inmates reported the lowest occupied capacity 
(between 55% and 71%) compared to jail jurisdictions holding 100 
inmates or more (between 80% and 86%) (table 7). In 2014 and 2015, 
about 80% of jail jurisdictions were operating at less than 100% 
of their capacity. The percentage of jail jurisdictions operating 
at more than 100% of their capacity ranged from 4% of jail 
jurisdictions with an ADP of 49 or fewer inmates to 24% of jail 
jurisdictions with an ADP of 1,000 to 2,499 inmates.

************************************
The smallest jail jurisdictions turn 
over inmates three times faster than 
the largest jails 
************************************

For the smallest jail jurisdictions (49 or fewer inmates), the 
number of admissions to their jails was 37 times the size 
of the ADP in 2015 (table 8). The smallest jails accounted for 
less than 10% of all jail admission in 2014 and 2015, and large 
jails (1,000 or more) accounted for more than a third of all 
admissions. The smallest jails weekly turnover rate (140%) was 
three times that of the largest jail jurisdictions with an ADP 
of 2,500 or more inmates (42%). The smallest jails also maintained 
the lowest capacity occupied at 55%. A higher inmate turnover rate 
indicates a shorter length of stay in jail and is associated with 
an increased burden by jurisdictions to process admissions 
and releases.

************************************
Jail staff supervised an additional 
57,100 persons in various community 
programs outside of jail
************************************

In addition to the confined jail population at yearend 2015, jail 
authorities also supervised 57,100 persons in various programs 
outside of the jail, including electronic monitoring, home 
detention, day reporting, community service, treatment programs, 
and other pretrial and work programs. On average, jails 
supervised an estimated 66,000 nonconfined persons each year 
between 2000 and 2015 (table 9). 

Local jail jurisdictions employed an estimated 213,300 full-time 
staff at yearend 2015 (table 10). Similar to 2013, most (79%) 
of the facility staff were correctional officers, including deputies, 
monitors, and other custody staff who spend more than 50% of their 
time with the incarcerated population. About 21% of the staff 
consisted of administrators, clerical and maintenance staff, 
educational staff, professional and technical staff, and other 
unspecified staff who spend more than 50% of their time in the 
facility. In 2013 and 2015, about 65% of the jail staff and 70% 
of all correctional officers were male. Nationally, the inmate-to-
correctional officer ratio was 4.1 in 2015, similar to 2013. 
For state-level estimates of correctional officers for 2013, 
see Census of Jails: Population Changes, 1999–2013 (NCJ 248627, 
BJS web, December 2015).

Methodology
*************

Annual Survey of Jails sampling design
***************************************

In years between the complete censuses of jails, the Bureau 
of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducts the Annual Survey 
of Jails (ASJ). The ASJ is a nationally representative survey 
of all county or city jail jurisdictions and all regional jails 
in the country. A jail jurisdiction is a county (parish in Louisiana) 
or municipal government that administers one or more local jails 
and represents the entity responsible for managing the jail facilities 
under its authority. Most jail jurisdictions consist of a single facility, 
but some contain multiple facilities and/or multiple facility operators, 
called reporting units. For example, four reporting units in Allegheny 
County, Pennsylvania, represent a single jail jurisdiction. 

The ASJ sample is drawn at the jurisdiction level. When a jail 
jurisdiction with multiple reporting units is sampled, data are 
collected from all reporting units within that jail jurisdiction. 
BJS collapses the reporting units into jail jurisdictions 
and reports statistics at the jurisdiction level.

ASJ uses a stratified probability sample of jail jurisdictions 
to estimate the number and characteristics of jail inmates 
nationwide. The 2015 ASJ sample consists of 876 jail 
jurisdictions, representing 2,851 active jail jurisdictions 
nationwide. 


The 2015 ASJ used 2013 Census of Jails as its sampling frame. 
All jail jurisdictions were grouped into 10 strata based on their 
average daily population (ADP) and presence of juveniles in 2013. 
In 8 of the 10 strata, a random sample of jail jurisdictions was 
selected. The remaining two strata were certainty strata, where 
all jurisdictions were selected with probability 1. One stratum 
consisted of all jails that were operated jointly by two or more 
jurisdictions (referred to as multijurisdictional jails). 
The other stratum consisted of all jail jurisdictions that-- 

* held juvenile inmates at the time of the 2013 Census of 
Jails and had an ADP of 500 or more inmates during the 
12 months ending on December 31, 2013

* held only adult inmates and had an ADP of 750 or more
were located in California

* were known to be operating in 2015 and not included in the 2013 
Census of Jails.

The ASJ sample includes all California jail jurisdictions. This 
sampling feature was introduced in 2013 in response to the 
enactment of California AB 109 and AB 117, aimed to reduce the 
number of inmates housed in state prisons starting on October 1, 
2011. After the enactment of these two laws, the jail population 
in California experienced an unusual increase, which was atypical 
of the rest of the United States. For this reason, the ASJ sampling 
design was modified to include all California jail jurisdictions 
n a certainty (self-representing) stratum (see Methodology in Jail 
Inmates at Midyear 2014 (NCJ 248629, BJS web, June 2015)). 
The inclusion of all California jail jurisdictions resulted in an 
additional 21 jurisdictions.

The sample also includes in the certainty stratum all six new 
jail jurisdictions that were known to be operating in 2015 
and not represented in the sampling frame (2013 Census of Jails).

Response rate and nonresponse adjustment 
*****************************************

Data were collected through a web-based survey. The initial sample 
consisted of 881 jail jurisdictions. Six jurisdictions were closed 
or merged with other jurisdictions at the time of the survey and 
dropped from the sample, resulting in a total of 876 active jail 
jurisdictions. The response rate was 97%. 
 
Nonresponse weighting adjustment 
***************************************

Nonresponse weighting was implemented to account for unit nonresponse. 
Jurisdictions were grouped into weighting classes based on sampling 
stratum and the 2013 inmate population. Using a simple weighting class 
method, the design weight of nonresponding jail jurisdictions was 
equally allocated to each of the responding jails within the same 
weighting class. The nonresponse weighting adjustment factor calculated 
within each weighting class h as:




where
nh = number of jurisdictions sampled in weighting class h,
whi = sampling weight for jurisdiction i in weighting class h,
JURISAhi = active status indicator for jurisdiction i in 
weighting class h (1 = active, 0 = out-of-scope), and
JURISRhi = response indicator of jurisdiction i in weighting 
class h (1 = respondent, 0 = nonrespondent).

Final weight 
*************
The final weight FWhi for each jail jurisdiction is 
FW hi = Whi × Fh × JURISRhi 
where 
JAILRhi set the final weight to 0 for jurisdictions that were out-of-scope or nonrespondents.

Item nonresponse imputation
*****************************
Item response rates ranged from 92% to 99%. For responding jail 
jurisdictions that were unable to provide some requested items, 
a weighted sequential hot-deck/cold-deck imputation procedure was used 
to impute values. This procedure, implemented using the SUDAAN software 
package, substitutes current-year respondent and prior-year (2013 Census 
of Jails, cold-deck) data for missing values. The donor for each missing 
item was randomly selected from within a set of similar jails, sorted by 
related previous-year population values. The resulting imputed values are 
generally similar to the reported values of the previous year, but are not 
identical because of differences between each donor and item pairing and 
the year-to-year fluctuation in donor population values. 


Midyear and yearend population difference
********************************************

Prior to 2015, the ASJ used midyear (last weekday in June) as the reference 
date in data collection. The 2015 ASJ changed the reference date to 
December 31. Comparisons of yearend data from 2015 ASJ with previous midyear 
data need to consider seasonal variations, as jails typically hold fewer 
inmates at yearend than at midyear. 

Calculating weekly turnover rates 
************************************

Weekly jail turnover rates were modeled after the Bureau of Labor 
Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Additional information 
on turnover rates is available at http://www.bls.gov/jlt/. Jail turnover 
rates were calculated by adding admissions and releases, and then dividing 
by the ADP. The turnover rate accounts for jail admissions and releases and 
gives an indication of the fluctuation of the jail population. It is 
calculated as the sum of average weekly admissions and releases, divided 
by the average daily population: (annual admissions + annual 
releases)/ADP*(7/365).

Jurisdiction size categories 
*******************************

In the 2011 through 2014 jail inmate reports, BJS categorized jurisdiction 
sizes based on the ADP during the 12 months ending midyear 2006 (the first 
year in the ASJ sample for that period). The jurisdiction size for 2015 was 
based on the ASJ 2015 sample. The jurisdiction size categories for 2014 were 
based on average daily population during the 12-month period ending June 30, 
2014, and for 2015 ADP was based on the 12-month period ending December 31, 
2015. It assumes a similar fluctuation in the ADP during the two time periods. 
As a result, not all data in previous reports are comparable with data in 
this report. 

Jail functions 
*****************

Jails in the ASJ include confinement facilities—usually administered 
by a local law enforcement agency—that are intended for adults but may hold 
juveniles before or after they are adjudicated. Facilities include jails 
and city or county correctional centers, special jail facilities, such as 
medical or treatment release centers, halfway houses, and work farms, and 
temporary holding or lockup facilities that are part of the jail’s combined 
function. Inmates sentenced to jail facilities usually have a sentence 
of 1 year or less. 

Within the ASJ, jails--

* receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them awaiting trial, 
conviction, or sentencing 


* re-admit probation, parole, and bail bond violators and absconders 
temporarily detain juveniles pending their transfer to juvenile authorities 

* hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to appropriate mental 
health facilities 

* hold individuals for the military, for protective custody, for contempt, 
and for the courts as witnesses 

* release convicted inmates to the community upon completion of sentence 

* transfer inmates to federal, state, or other authorities 

* house inmates for federal, state, or other authorities because 
of crowding of their facilities
 
* sometimes operate community-based programs as alternatives 
to incarceration.
