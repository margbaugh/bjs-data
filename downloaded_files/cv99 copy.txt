Highlights

Every major type of personal and property crime measured
decreased between 1993 and 1999.

*  According to National Crime Victimization Survey data, from
1998 to 1999 the overall violent crime rate declined 10%, and
the property crime rate fell 9%. 

*  Victimization rates in 1999 are the lowest recorded since the
survey's creation in 1973.***Footnote 1: Pre-1992 estimates were
adjusted to account for the 1992 redesign of the National Crime
victimization Survey.***

*  The decline in overall violent crime rate resulted from a
decrease in the simple assault rate.  Apparent declines in
robbery and aggravated assault rates were not significant.

*  Overall property crime rates fell between 1998 and 1999 due
to lower rates of burglary and household theft.

*  The motor vehicle theft rate remained similar to 1998 rate. 

*  During 1999 males and blacks were victims of overall violent
crime at rates greater than those of whites and persons of other
races.

*  54% of overall violent crime victims knew the perpetrator(s)
in 1999.  Almost 7 in 10 rape or sexual assault victims, in
contrast to fewer than 5 in 10 aggravated assault victims, knew
the offender(s) as acquaintance, friend, relative, or intimate.

*  44% of overall violent victimizations and 34% of all property
crimes were reported to the police in 1999.  The most frequently
reported crime was motor vehicle theft (84%), while the least
frequently reported victimization was personal theft (26%).
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Approximately 28.8 million violent and property crimes were
experienced by Americans age 12 or older during 1999 according
to National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data.  Overall
victimizations included about 21.2 million property crimes
(burglary, motor vehicle theft and household theft), 7.4 million
violent crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, and simple assault), and approximately 0.2 million
personal thefts (pocket picking and purse snatching).

In 1999 there were 33 violent victimizations per 1,000 persons
age 12 or older.  This represented a 10% decrease from the 37
per 1,000 in 1998.  The rate of property victimization fell 9%
from 1998 to 1999, from 217 to 198 per 1,000 households.  The
1999 estimates of violence continued a consistent downward trend
that began in 1994, while those for overall property crime began
declining in 1974.

Violent victimization rates fell 34% from 50 to 33
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older between 1993
and 1999.  The 1993 data were the first from a complete year 
following the survey's redesign.  The 1999 personal theft rate
of 0.9 per 1,000 persons represents a significant decline from
the 1993 values (2.3 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older).

---------------------------------------------------------------
Victimization trends, 1973-99

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) was a pioneering
effort when it began in 1972 and has benefited from ongoing
improvements.  In addition, a major methodological redesign was
completed in 1992. Using adjustments to account for the methodological
improvements instituted in 1992, the NCVS provides a 26-year trend of
criminal victimization now.***Footnote 2: For more information about
the redesign, see The Effects of the Redesign on Victimization Estimates
(NCJ 164381), National Crime Victimization Survey (Ncj 151169), National
Crime Victimization Survey Redesign: Fact Sheet (NCJ 151170), Technical
Background (NCJ 151172), and the Questions & Answers (NCJ 151171.*** 

Violent crime

Between 1973 and 1994, violent crime victimization rates at
times fluctuated.  Since 1994 declines in violent crime rates
have continued.  Between 1994 and 1995 and   between 1995 and
1996, a 10% reduction in the violent crime rate occurred,
followed by 7% decreases between 1996 and 1997 and between 1997
and 1998.  The 10% declines in the violent crime rate occurring
in 1994-95, 1995-96, and 1998-99 are tied as the largest
single-year percent decreases in NCVS history.  

In general, robbery trends over the last 27 years paralleled
overall violent crime trends.  Initially, robbery rates fell
from 1974-78, then increased until 1981.  Between 1981 and 1985
the rate rose slowly until 1994, and since have decreased to the
current level of 7 robberies per 1,000 persons -- the lowest
robbery rates recorded by the NCVS. 

From 1974 the rate of aggravated assault declined with some
interruptions until the mid-1980's.  After a few years of
minimal change in both directions, the aggravated assault rate
increased from 1990 to 1993.  Since that time, aggravated
assault rate fell steadily reaching the current level -- the
lowest ever recorded.

Simple assault, the most common form of violent crime measured
by the NCVS, increased from 1974 to 1977, remained stable until
1979, then declined until 1989.  Between 1990 and 1991, simple
assault rates returned to the peak levels found during the late
1970's.  Between 1991 and 1994, the rates rose to the highest
levels recorded, 32 victimizations per 1,000 persons.  Since
1994 simple assault rates have fallen to the lowest level
recorded, 21 simple assaults per 1,000 persons.

Property crime

Aside from an increase between 1973 and 1974, the overall
property crime rate has declined.  After a period of slow
decline that was interrupted by an increase from 1980 to 1981,
the burglary rate fell each year through the rest of the period.
The 1999 household burglary rate was about a third that of the
adjusted rate of 1973 (34 burglaries per 1,000 households).  

Despite some periods of increases, the motor vehicle theft rate
declined from 1973 through 1999.  The 1999 rates were nearly
half those seen in 1973 (19 versus 10 motor vehicle thefts per
1,000 households). In general between 1973 and 1985, motor
vehicle theft rates fell.  From 1985 through 1991, motor vehicle
theft rates increased markedly peaking in 1991.  Between 1992
and 1994 motor vehicle theft rates remained stable, then began
to decline at a slow pace.

Thefts increased between 1973 and 1974, then remained stable
until 1977.  From this time, the rate has declined steadily.  In
1999 the theft rate was about 61% lower than the adjusted rate
in 1973.

Criminal victimization, 1998 to 1999 

Violent crime

The NCVS collects data on reported and unreported nonfatal
violent crimes against persons age 12 or older in the United
States.  The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program of the FBI
collects data on homicide.

Violent crimes measured by the NCVS

Overall violent victimization includes rape, sexual assault,
robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault.  Between 1998
and 1999, overall violent crime fell 10% from 37 to 33
victimizations per 1,000 persons.   Declines in both attempted
and completed violent crimes contributed to the decrease in
overall violence during this period.

Simple assault was the only of the 4 major components of overall
violent crime to decrease significantly between 1998 and 1999.
Apparent decreases in robbery and aggravated assault were not
significant.  However, two decreases emerged in specific
subcategories of violent crime.  Aggravated assault with injury
decreased slightly, and robbery without injury fell
significantly from 1998-99.  

Violent crime rates fell for many of the demographic groups considered 
between 1998 and 1999.  The rate at which males, whites, and non-Hispanic
persons were victimized decreased between 1998 and 1999.

Violent victimization rates fell among several of the age 
groups that historically have experienced the highest

Persons age 16 to 19 and 35 to 49 experienced violence at rates
significantly lower in 1999 than they did in 1998.  Persons age
25 to 34 were victimized in 1999 at rates somewhat lower than
they were in 1998. 

An examination of income and violent crimes demonstrates that
violent crime rates declined between 1998-99 for those who have
historically experienced the lowest rates of violent
victimization -- those with the highest annual household
incomes.  Persons residing in households with annual incomes of
greater than $75,000 experienced violent crime at lower rates in
1999 than they did in 1998.

Change in violent victimization, by category, 
1998-99

The figure shows the estimated annual percentage change in
victimization rates from 1998 to 1999 for the categories that
comprise violent crime:  homicide, rape and sexual assault,
aggravated assault, simple assault, and robbery.  The crime
categories are displayed vertically according to their 1999
rates per 1,000 population age 12 or older.  Total violent (the
sum of all types) is first with the highest rate, and murder is
last with the lowest rate.  

Because the National Crime Victimization Survey relies on a
sample of households, the rates and numbers from it are
estimates and are not exact. Each bar shows the range within
which the true percent change in rates from year to year is
likely to fall.  

If a bar is clear of the "No change" line, we are reasonably
certain a change occurred.  If a bar crosses the "No change"
line, there is a possibility that there was no change.  The
degree of certainty depends on where the bar crosses the line. 
The bars representing the crime categories in which a
statistically significant year-to-year change occurred are
outlined.

The length of the range bars varies considerably from crime to
crime, dependent on sample size and rarity of the event.  The 
preliminary  value for the change in homicide rates is given as a 
point and not a range of estimates because homicide rates are derived 
from nonsample data.  The murder rates have no variance, but some
discrepancies exist between UCR rates and Vital Statistics of the 
National Center for Health Statistics.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Violent crime rates were similar in 1998 and 1999 among persons
in the Northeast and South.  For people in the West -- the area
that historically has experienced the highest victimization
rates -- victimization rates fell significantly from 47 to 37
victimizations per 1,000 persons.  Persons living in the Midwest
experienced violent crimes at somewhat lower rates in 1999 than
in 1998 (40 versus 36 violent victimizations per 1,000 persons).

Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter 
measured by the UCR 

Preliminary estimates from the UCR program of the FBI suggest
that the number of murders declined about 8% between 1998 and
1999.  Among regions, preliminary estimates suggest a decline in
the number of murders of 10% in the South (the highest decline)
and a 4% decline in the Northeast (the smallest decline).  The
Midwest and West each saw declines of 7%.   See text box for
more information.

---------------------------------------------------------------
Murder in the United States, 1999

Statistics on murder are compiled from over 16,000 city, county,
and State law enforcement agencies as part of the FBI's Uniform
Crime Reports (UCR).  In 1998 the UCR program stated that 16,914
murders occurred in the United States.  Preliminary 1999 UCR
data suggest about an 8% drop in the number of murders in the
United States, resulting in an estimated 15,561 murders during
1999.

The FBI defines murder in its annual Crime in the United States
as the willful, nonnegligent killing of one human being by
another.  The incidence of murder varies across victim
characteristics.  The relationship between victim
characteristics and homicide victims has remained stable year
after year.

*  Males account for about three-quarters of all murder victims.
*  White and black persons each account for almost half of all
homicide victims.
*  About 1 in 8 people murdered are less than 18 years of age. 
*  Firearms are used in about 7 in 10 homicides. 
*  Homicide rates tend to be the highest in the South and the
lowest in the Northeast.
*  Metropolitan cities experience homicide in higher rates than
smaller cities and rural areas.

Property crime

In the NCVS, property crime includes burglary, motor vehicle
theft, and theft.  Between 1998 and 1999, overall property crime
rates fell 9% from 217 to 198 incidents per 1,000 households. 
The decline in overall property crime rates is explained by
significant decreases in burglary and theft during this period.

Burglary rates fell 11% from 39 to 34 victimizations between
1998 and 1999 due primarily to a significant decrease in
completed burglary.  Theft rates decreased 8% from 1998 to 1999
(168 to 154 thefts per 1,000 households).  

Property crime rates declined between 1998 and 1999 for several
of the demographic groups examined.  The overall property crime
rate fell from 213 to 190 property victimizations per 1,000
households for white households.   Fewer property victimizations
occurred among both Hispanic and non-Hispanic households in 1999
than in 1998.

Urban and suburban households experienced significantly lower,
and rural households sustained slightly lower rates of property
crime in 1999 compared to 1998.  Property crime rates fell
during the same period for persons who owned and persons who
rented their home.

Characteristics of violent crime 
victims, 1999

The well-documented relationship between victimization and
demographics was demonstrated in 1999.  Violent crime rates show
that groups that were most vulnerable to victimization in the
past continued to be most vulnerable in 1999.

Gender of victim

Males were victims of overall violent crime, robbery, aggravated
assault, and simple assault at rates higher than females in
1999.  Males experienced violent crime at rates 28% greater (37
compared to 29 victimizations per 1,000), and were robbed at
rates more than 2 times that (5 compared to 2 robberies per
1,000) of females.  Females were victims of rape and sexual
assault at 7.5 times greater the rate of males.  During 1999, 
3 females in contrast to 0.4 males per 1,000 were raped or
sexually assaulted.

Age of victim

In 1999 persons age 12-15, 16-19, and 20-24 experienced similar
rates of overall violent victimization (74, 77, and 69
victimizations per 1,000 persons, respectively).  These youngest
persons sustained violent crime at rates higher than persons in
all other age categories.  Among persons ages 25 and older,
violent victimization rates decreased as age increased.  For
example, 36 persons age 25-34 compared to 4 persons age 65 and
greater per 1,000 were victimized during 1999.

Race of victim

Blacks were victims of overall violent crime in 1999 at rates
higher than whites and than other races considered together.*"Other
races" refers to an aggregation including Asians, Native Hawaiians,
other Pacific Islanders, Alaska Natives, and American Indians.* 
Forty-two blacks, 32 whites, and 25 persons of other races per
1,000 were victimized during this time.  Blacks experienced
rape/sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault at higher
rates than whites.  Compared to persons of other races
considered together, blacks were more likely to experience
overall violent crime and simple assault.  Whites experienced
overall violent crime, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple
assault at higher rates than persons of other races taken as a
whole.

Ethnicity of victim

Non-Hispanics and Hispanics were victims of overall violent
crime and rape or sexual assault at similar rates in 1999. 
Non-Hispanics were slightly more likely to become a victim of a
simple assault, while Hispanics were more likely to become a
victim of a robbery and an aggravated assault during the same
period.

Household income

In general, higher annual household incomes were associated with
lower violent victimization rates during 1999. Individuals in
households with annual incomes greater than $75,000 were victims
of violent crime at rates lower than other income categories (23
per 1,000 persons).  In contrast, persons in households earning
less than $7,500 annually experienced the highest rate of
violence of all income categories (58 per 1,000 persons).

Marital status

In 1999 those who never married were the most likely to be
violent crime victims, followed by those who were divorced or
separated.  These persons were more likely to be victimized than
married individuals, who, in turn, had higher victimization
rates than widowed persons.  Those who never married became
violent crime victims at 10 times the rate of widowed persons
and over 4 times the rate of married persons.

Region

Western and Midwestern residents had similar and higher violent
victimization rates than people in other regions in 1999 (37 and
36 victimizations per 1,000 persons, respectively).  Similarly,
Northeastern and Southern residents experienced similar rates of
violent crime (30 per 1,000 persons).

Residence

Urban residents experienced overall violent victimization at
rates higher than suburban residents, and suburban residents
experienced overall violent victimization at rates higher than
rural residents in 1999.  During 1999, 40  urban residents, 33
suburban resident and 25 rural residents per 1,000 persons were
victims of a violent crime per 1,000 persons.  Similar patterns
in victimization rates occurred for robbery, total assault and
simple assault.  Only one geographic difference emerged for rape
and sexual assault -- urban residents were victimized at almost
twice the rate of rural residents.  

Victim-offender relationship

About half (54%) of violent crime victims knew the offender(s)
in 1999.  Rape or sexual assault victims were most likely to know 
the offender(s) (69%), and robbery victims were least likely to know 
the offender(s) (34%).  Victims identified intimate partners as 
offenders in 11% of overall violent crimes, 20% of rape or sexual 
assaults, and 8% of aggravated assault.  

Female victims were more likely than male victims to identify an
intimate as an offender.  Intimates were offenders in 20% of the
overall violence against females, versus 3% of the violence
against males.  Intimates committed 16% of the aggravated
assaults experienced by females compared to 3% experienced by
males.

Males experienced violence at the hands of strangers in higher
percentages than females.  Strangers committed 55% of the
overall violence experienced by males compared to 32% of that
sustained by females.

Weapon use

Twenty-five percent of all violent victimizations were committed
by an offender(s) who had a firearm, knife, or other weapon. 
The presence or absence of a firearm differed across the type of
crime considered.  For example, 1% of rapes or sexual assaults
versus 24% of robberies occurred with firearm present.

Characteristics of property crime 
victims, 1999

Race of household head 

Blacks experienced property crimes, regardless of the type of
property crime, at higher rates than whites in 1999.  For
example, 250 black and 190 white households per 1,000 were
victims of property crime overall during 1999.  Similar findings
emerged for burglary as 53 black and 32 white households per
1,000 households were burglarized. Persons of other races
experienced overall property crime and burglaries at rates lower
than blacks, but were victims of motor vehicle theft and theft
at rates equal to blacks.

Ethnicity of household head

Hispanic households were characterized by higher rates of
overall property crime, motor vehicle theft, and theft than
non-Hispanic households in 1999.  Hispanic households were
almost twice as likely to have a motor vehicle stolen than
non-Hispanic households (17 versus 9 motor vehicle thefts per
1,000 households).  Hispanic and non-Hispanic households were
burglarized at similar rates during 1999 (37 and 34 burglaries
per 1,000 households, respectively).

Household income

The relationship between annual household income and property
crimes depended upon the crime considered.  For example, no
clear relationship between household income and overall property
crime emerged during 1999.  The highest and lowest income
categories were victims of property crimes at equal rates (about
220 per 1,000 households), while the victimization rates of
intermediate income categories varied.  In contrast, the higher
the annual household income, the lower the burglary rate, but
the higher the rate of theft. 

Region, residence, and home ownership

Western households had the highest rate of overall property
crime, motor vehicle theft, and theft rates of all regions in
1999.  Western, Southern, and Midwestern households experienced
similar burglary rates. Northeastern households had the lowest
burglary rate in the Nation.

Urban households were the most vulnerable to overall property
crime, burglary, motor vehicle theft and theft during 1999. 
Suburban households were more likely to experience all forms of
property crime than were rural households, with the exception of
burglary.  Rural households were burglarized at rates
significantly greater than suburban households during this
period (33 versus 27 burglaries per 1,000 households,
respectively). 

Property crime was significantly more likely to occur among
households residing in rented property.  Such households
experienced 48% higher rates of overall property crime, 85%
higher rates of burglary, 55% higher rates of motor vehicle
theft, and 40% higher rates of theft than households residing in
residences that they owned.

Reporting to the police

Victimizations were reported to police in over 4 in 10 violent
crimes and in over 3 in 10 property crimes in 1999. Robbery was
the most often reported violent crime (61%) while rape or sexual
assault was the least often violent crime reported to law
enforcement (28%).  Police were notified in approximately a
quarter of personal thefts like purse snatching and pocket
picking.  Motor vehicle theft continued to be the most often
reported property crime (84%), while theft was the least often
reported to the police (27%).  The percentages of victimizations
reported to police in 1999 were similar to those reported in
1998, with three exceptions.  The percentage of thefts reported
to the police fell significantly between 1998 and 1999, while
reporting of all victimizations and of property crime overall
fell somewhat.

Violent victimization of females was reported to police in
significantly higher percentages than victimizations of males in
1999 (49% versus 40%).  The percentage of violent victimization
reported to the police differed by race and Hispanic origin. 
The violent victimization of a black woman was reported (49%) to
police at significantly higher percentages than victimizations
of white men (40%), black men (37%), and Hispanic men (38%). 
Black women also had slightly higher percentage of reporting
than women of other races considered together.

In contrast to the significant differences in reporting to
police of inmate partner violence against black (67%) and white
(50%) women, reporting to law enforcement of overall violence
against women was similar for the two races.

Victimization trends, 1993-99

The NCVS underwent an extensive redesign in 1992 based on
improvements that the National Academy of Sciences recommended. 
In 1993 the first full year of data was collected under the
current design.  For that reason, trends in this discussion are
presented with 1993 as the beginning point.

The rate of every major violent and property crime measured in
the NCVS -- rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault,
simple assault, burglary, theft and motor vehicle theft -- fell
significantly between 1993 and 1999.

Murder and nonnegligent 
manslaughter

Based on preliminary FBI data for 1999, the rate and overall
number of murders in the United States continued a steady
decline that began in 1993.  According to preliminary estimates,
15,561 murders occurred in the United States in 1999 compared to
24,530 recorded in 1993.  While homicide numbers continue to
change, victim characteristics remain unchanged.  Whites and
blacks continue to comprise about half of murder victims each. 
Approximately 75% of homicide victims are male, older than 18,
and live in the South.  As found in the past about 70% of
homicide victims were killed with a firearm during 1998.

Violent crime

The overall violent crime rate fell 34% from 50 to 33
victimizations per 1,000 persons between 1993 and 1999.  Further
significant declines were noted in rates of rape/sexual assault
(down 32%), robbery (down 40%), aggravated assault (down 44%),
and simple assault (down 29%). 

Personal theft

Personal theft rates decreased 61% from 2.3 personal thefts in
1993 to 0.9 per 1,000 persons in 1999.

Property crime

Every major type of property crime as well as property crime
overall declined between 1993 and 1999.  Rates of household
burglary fell 41%, motor vehicle theft fell 47%, and theft fell
36%.  The largest percentage decrease emerged in attempted
motor vehicle thefts (down 64%) which fell from 7 attempted
motor vehicle thefts in 1993 to 2 attempts in 1999 per 1,000
households.

Characteristics of victims

Most demographic categories -- gender, race, Hispanic
origin, household income, and urbanicity -- experienced 
significantly decreasing rates of violent victimization, 
1993-99. The rate of violence against females or persons living 
in households with an annual income of $7,500-$14,999 or 
$25,000-$34,999 declined slightly, accounting for an average 
of 2 fewer violent victimizations of per 1,000 annually, 1993-99. 

-------------------------------------------------------------
Trends in violent victimization, 1973-99

Because the National Crime Victimization Survey relies on a
sample of households, the rates and numbers from it are
estimates and are not exact.

The figure shows trends in the violent victimization rate:  Each
bar shows the range within which the true victimization rate is
likely to fall for the indicated year, and the line represents
the best estimate, the most likely value for the rate in each
year, which is the published number. There is a greater
likelihood that the true rate will fall near the best estimate,
and the bars reflect that likelihood:  The darker the bar
segment, the greater the likelihood.

Because the estimates are based on samples, their precision
depends on the sample size:  The larger the sample, the better
the estimate and the smaller the range bars.  Some year-to-year
changes are so large that contiguous bars do not touch (1980-81,
1982-83, 1990-91, 1994-95, and 1995-96), suggesting
statistically significant increases and decreases.  Where there
is a lot of overlap (1973-76 and 1986-90), the year-to-year
changes may be too small to be statistically significant. 

Even though the victimization rates have a range of possible
values, general trends are readily apparent. Violent crime rates
increased from the early 1970's to the early 1980's, then fell
until around 1986.  For several years in the late 1980's,
violent crime rates were stable, but increased in the early
1990's and fell after 1994 through 1999.

For more explanation of this graph, see the BJS Technical 
Report Displaying Violent Crime Trends Using Estimates from 
the National Crime Victimization Survey, NCJ 167881.
---------------------------------------------------------------

Significantly declining trends in violent crimes meant that
whites and non- Hispanics sustained 3 fewer, blacks and
Hispanics sustained 5 fewer, and persons of other races
experienced 4 fewer violent victimizations per 1,000 persons
annually, 1993-99.  

While there were decreasing trends in violent crime at all
income levels, the decrease was greatest among persons with the
lowest incomes.  From 1993 to 1999 persons with household
incomes below $7,500 annually sustained 5 fewer victimizations
per 1,000 persons.  Those with annual household incomes of
$35,000 or more experienced 3 fewer violent victimizations per
1,000 each year, 1993-99.

Property rates between 1993 and 1999 declined significantly for
every demographic group considered.  White, black, and other race 
households sustained a minimum of 21 fewer property crimes per 1,000
annually (21,22, and 25 respectively).  Hispanic households had
the greatest decline across the 7 years of all groups  36 per
1,000 households fewer property crimes annually.  

Among residences, urban households benefited from the greatest
decline in property crime rates with an average 

of 26 fewer property crimes per 1,000 for each succeeding year. 
Households with the highest annual income sustained 29 fewer
property crimes per 1,000 annually, 1993-99.           

Survey methodology

This Bulletin presents data on non-lethal violence and property
crimes from the National Crime Victimization Survey, and data on
homicide from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program.  The
NCVS collects data on nonfatal crimes against persons age 12 and
older, reported and not reported to the police, from a
nationally representative sample of households in the United
States.  The NCVS provides information about victims (age,
gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, income and educational
level), offenders (gender, race, approximate age, and
victim-offender relations) and criminal offenses (time and place
of occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic
consequences).

In 1999, 42,895 households and 77,750 people age 12 or older
were interviewed.  For the 1999 NCVS data presented here, the
response rate is 93% of eligible households and 89% of eligible
individuals.  

The data in this Bulletin were collected during the calendar
year being estimated.  Because of the retrospective nature of
the survey, the estimates in this bulletin include some
incidents that actually occurred during the previous year. 
Analyses comparing the victimization information collected in a
calendar year (termed a collection year) to that obtained about
victimizations experienced in the same calendar year (called a
data year) show only a small difference between the two methods.
For example, for 1995 the violent crime rate based on data year
victimization was 44.5 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older,
compared to 46.6 based on the collection year method.  Differences 
in estimates obtained from data year and collection year methods
are greater during periods of changing crime rates and less during
periods of stable rates.

Testing trends and annual differences 
in violent and property victimization

When a statement is made describing a higher or lower rate in
different years, it was tested for significance using a computer
program designed for the NCVS.  Tests of this type determine
whether a rate or percentage in one year differs from that of
another, regardless of intervening variation.  For example the
percent changes in victimization rates presented in table 7 were
based on this test. 

When a statement is made describing the increase or decrease of
a linear trend, it was tested using a linear trend test.  This
test compares the slope of the trend to a horizontal line that
has a slope of zero, determining whether the slope generated
from a change in an estimate differs from a flat trend.  

For example, the linear trend test may be conducted as a
regression equation with an independent variable of time and a
dependent variable violent victimization.  A regression
coefficient (b) and its corresponding standard error (sigma) are
computed, and a t-statistic - the ratio b/sigma - is calculated.  If
the t-statistic is greater than 1.96 for a two-tailed test, (or
greater than 1.645 for a one-tailed test), the slope is
considered significantly different from zero.  If the
t-statistic is greater than 1.645 for a two-tailed test, (or
1.28 for a one-tailed test), the slope is considered slightly
different from zero.  If the t-statistics are less than the
critical values, the analyst must conclude that the change in
the estimate did not differ significantly from zero or was not
statistically significant.

This Bulletin, the first in BJS to report from linear trend
tests, used them in  Characteristics of victims, on pages 
11 and 12.  In previous NCVS reports, testing on trend end
points was used.

Standard error computations

Comparisons made in this Bulletin were tested to determine if
observed differences were statistically significant. 
Differences described as higher, lower, or different in this
bulletin passed a hypothesis test at the .05 level of
statistical significance (95% confidence level).  That is, the
tested difference was greater than twice the standard error of
that difference.  For comparisons which were statistically
significant at the .10 level of statistical significance (90%
confidence level), the term somewhat different, marginally
different or slight difference is used to note the nature of the
difference.

Caution is required when comparing estimates not explicitly
discussed in the bulletin text.  What may appear to be large
differences may not test as statistically at the 95% or even the
90% confidence level.  Significance testing calculations were
conducted at the Bureau of Justice Statistics using statistical
programs developed specifically for the NCVS by the U.S.Census 
Bureau.  These programs take consider the complex NCVS
sample design when calculating generalized variance estimates.
