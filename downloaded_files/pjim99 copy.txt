Prison and Jail Inmates 
at Midyear 1999   

By  Allen J. Beck, Ph.D.
BJS Statistician

------------------------------------------------------
Highlights

From yearend 1990 to 
midyear 1999 --

*  The rate of incarceration increased from 1 in every 218 U.S.
residents to 1 in every 147.

*  State, Federal, and local governments had to accommodate an
additional 83,743 inmates per year (or the equivalent of 1,610
new inmates per week).

In the year ending June 30, 1999 --
* The number  of inmates held in  jail  rose by 13,481, in State
prison by 34,238, and in Federal prison by 10,614.  The rate of
increase was the lowest since 1979 (prisons) and 1996 (jails).  

On June 30, 1999  --
*  An estimated 11% of black males, 4% of Hispanic males, and
1.5% of white males in their twenties and early thirties were in
prison or jail.

*  Men were nearly 12 times more likely than women to be
incarcerated.  There were 106 female inmates per 100,000 women
in the United States, compared to 1,261 male inmates per 100,000
men. 

*  Louisiana had the highest total incarceration rate (1,025
prison and jail inmates per 100,000 residents), followed by
Texas (1,014) and Georgia (956).  Five States had incarceration
rates below 300: Vermont (203), Maine (220), Minnesota (226),
North Dakota (239), and Hawaii (291).
----------------------------------------------------------------

At midyear 1999 the Nation's prisons and jails incarcerated
1,860,520 persons.  Federal and State prison authorities and
local jail authorities held in their custody 682 persons per
100,000 U.S. residents.  Prisoners in the custody of the 50
States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government
accounted for two-thirds of the incarcerated population
(1,254,577 inmates).  The other third were held in local jails
(605,943).

On June 30, 1999, 1,333,561 prisoners were under Federal and
State jurisdiction, which includes inmates in custody and
persons under the legal authority of a prison system but held
outside its facilities.  The total increased 4.4% from midyear
1998.  Vermont  (up 14.9%), Wyoming (up 14.7%), and Delaware (up
14.3%) had the largest  percentage increases.  Nine States
reported decreases, including Rhode Island (-11.2%) and Ohio
(-4.5%).

At midyear 1999 local jail authorities held or supervised
687,973 offenders -- an increase of 3.5% from midyear 1998. 
Twelve percent of these offenders (82,030) were supervised
outside jail facilities in programs such as community service,
work release, weekend reporting, electronic monitoring, and
other alternative programs. 

Nearly 1.9 million inmates were in prisons and local jails

On June 30, 1999, 1,254,577 inmates were in the custody of State
and Federal prison authorities, and 605,943 inmates were in the
custody of local jail authorities.  These data were collected in
the 1999 National Prisoner Statistics program and the 1999
Census of Jails.

Since midyear 1998 the total incarcerated population has
increased 3.2% (table 1).  The number of inmates in State
prisons has increased 3.1%; in Federal prisons, 9.9%; and in
local jails, 2.3%. 

Between yearend 1990 and midyear 1999, the incarcerated
population grew on average 5.8% annually.  During this period
the Federal and State prison populations and the local jail
population grew at the average annual rates of 8.5%, 6.1%, and
4.8%, respectively.

In the 12 months before midyear 1999, the number of inmates in
prison and jail rose an estimated 58,333 inmates, or 1,122
inmates per week. Since yearend 1990, the total custody
population has risen by 711,818 inmates, the equivalent of 1,607
inmates per week.

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail in 1999 was 682
inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents -- up from 458 per 100,000 in
1990.  At midyear 1999, 1 in every 147 U.S. residents were
incarcerated.

Nation's inmate population projected 
to reach 2 million by late 2001

*  Although future growth is difficult to predict due to
declining crime rates and changing Federal, State, and local
criminal justice policies, inmate populations can be projected
based on recent numerical increases and growth rates. Based on
three different sets of assumptions about Federal and State
prison and local jail population growth, national estimates have
been produced through the end of 2001.

*  Assuming a continuation of either numerical increases or
growth rates for the 12-month period ending June 30, 1999, the
total inmate population is projected to reach 2 million around
the end of 2001.

U.S. prison population rose 4.4% -- the smallest annual growth
rate since 1979

Between July 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999, the number of inmates
under State jurisdiction grew 3.8%, and the number under Federal
jurisdiction, 9.6% (table 2). Jurisdiction counts include
prisoners in custody and persons under the legal authority of a
prison system while being held outside its facilities.  Compared
to the previous 12-month period ending June 30, 1998, State
prison growth rates were smaller (down to 3.8% from 4.4%), while
the  Federal prison growth rate was larger (up to 9.6% from
7.9%).

In absolute numbers, the total increase of 56,059 prison inmates
between July 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999, was slightly smaller
than the increase of 57,726 recorded in the previous 12-month
period and below the annual average growth (62,414) since 1990.

Nearly half of the growth in the prison populations during the
12 months ending June 30, 1999, was accounted for by the Federal
system (11,470 additional inmates), California (5,781), Georgia
(3,471), New York (3,237) and Texas (2,881).  During this
12-month period,  seven States and the District of Columbia
experienced growth of at least 10%, led by Vermont (14.9%),
Wyoming (14.7%), Delaware (14.3) and Wisconsin (12.3%).  Nine
States experienced a decline in their prison population. Rhode
Island had the largest decline, -11.2%, followed by Ohio, -4.5%;
Hawaii, -3.1%; and North Carolina, -3.0%.

Prison incarceration rates have risen sharply since 1990

The incarceration rate of State and Federal prisoners sentenced
to more than a year reached 468 per 100,000 U.S. residents on
June 30, 1999.  Eleven States led by Louisiana (763) sentenced
prisoners per 100,000 State residents), Texas (704), Oklahoma
(653), and Mississippi (613) exceeded the national rate (table
3).  Three States -- Minnesota (121), Maine (128), and North
Dakota (130) -- had rates that were less than a third of the
national rate.  The District of Columbia, which is an urban
jurisdiction that should not be compared to States, held 1,600
sentenced prisoners per 100,000 District residents at midyear
1999.

Since 1990 the number of sentenced inmates per 100,000 residents
has risen an average of 5.7% annually, increasing from 292 to
468.  During this period prison incarceration rates rose the
most in the South (from 316 to 524) and West (from 277 to 423). 
The rate in the Midwest rose from 239 to 363, and the rate in
the Northeast rose from 232 to 333.  The number of sentenced
Federal prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents increased from 20
to 40 over the same period.

Female prisoner population have 
nearly doubled since 1990

From July 1, 1998, to June 30, 1999, the number of women under
the jurisdiction of State and Federal prison authorities grew
from 82,662 to 87,199, an increase of 5.5% (table 4).  The
number of men rose 4.3%, from 1,194,840 to 1,246,362.  At
midyear 1999 women accounted for 6.5% of all prisoners, up from
5.7% in 1990.

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident population, men
were nearly 16 times more likely than women to be in a State or
Federal prison.  On June 30, 1999, the rate for inmates serving
a sentence of more than a year was 57 sentenced female inmates
per 100,000 women in the United States, compared to 897
sentenced male inmates per 100,000 men. 

At midyear the Nation's jails supervised 687,973 persons

Based on the 1999 Census of Jails, the Nation's 3,365 local
jails held or supervised 687,973 offenders on June 30, 1999
(table 5).  Jail authorities supervised 12% of these offenders
(82,030) in alternative programs outside the jail facilities. 
An estimated 605,943 persons were housed in local jails.

As defined in this report, jails are locally operated
correctional facilities that confine persons before or after
adjudication.  Inmates sentenced to jail usually have a sentence
of a year or less, but jails also incarcerate persons in a wide
variety of other categories.
(See box below.) 

Jails --

*  receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them
awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing

*  readmit probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and
absconders

*  temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to juvenile
authorities

*  hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to
appropriate health facilities

*  hold individuals for the military, for protective custody,
for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses

*  release convicted inmates to the community upon completion of
sentence

*  transfer inmates to Federal, State, or other authorities

*  house inmates for Federal, State, or other authorities
because of crowding of their facilities

*  relinquish custody of temporary detainees to juvenile and
medical authorities

*  sometimes operate community-based programs as alternatives to
incarceration

*  hold inmates sentenced to short terms (generally under 1
year).

In 1995 BJS began to obtain counts of the number of offenders
under the supervision of jail authorities in the community. 
Respondents were asked if their jail jurisdiction operated any
community-based programs and how many persons participated in
them.  Offenders under the supervision of a probation, parole,
or other correctional agency were excluded from these counts. 
Because jail authorities reported offenders in treatment
programs administered by the jail jurisdiction in 1999, it is
difficult to compare totals with those in 1995.  

Among persons under community supervision by jail staff in 1999,
25% were required to perform community service (20,139) and 20%
to participate in a weekend reporting program (16,089).  Twelve
percent of offenders in the community were under electronic
monitoring, 12% were under pretrial supervision, 10% were in a
drug, alcohol, mental health, or other type of medical treatment
program, and 9% were in a work release or other alternative work
program. 

12-month growth in jail inmates in 1999 half the annual rate since 1990 

Between July 1, 1998, and June 30, 1999, the number of persons
held in local jail facilities grew  2.3% -- from 592,462 to
605,943.  The 12-month increase was half the average growth
(4.6%) from midyear 1990 to midyear 1999.  In absolute numbers,
the total increase of 13,481 inmates in 1999 represented the
smallest growth since 1996 (in which the number of inmates rose
by 11,448) and was significantly smaller than the average annual
increase of 22,291 inmates in each 12-month period since midyear
1990.

Since 1990 the Nation's jail population on a per capita basis
has increased over a third.  During this period the number of
jail inmates per 100,000 residents rose from 163 to 222.  When
offenders under community supervision by jail authorities are
included with those in custody, the rate was 252 offenders per
100,000 U.S. residents at midyear 1999.

An estimated 9,458 persons under age 18 were housed in adult
jails on June 30, 1999 (table 6).   Ninety-one percent of these
young inmates had been convicted or were being held for trial
as adults in criminal court.  (See Methodology, page 11, for
changes in the definition of juvenile.) 

The average daily population for the year ending June 30, 1999,
was 607,978, an increase of 2.4% from 1998.

Characteristics of jail inmates changed little

Male inmates made up 89% of the local jail inmate population at
midyear 1999 -- 2 percentage points lower than at midyear 1990
(table 7).  On average the adult female jail population has
grown 6.8% annually since 1990, while the adult male inmate
population has grown 4.2%.  On June 30, 1999, local jails held
nearly 1 in every 181 adult men and 1 in 1,538 women.

At midyear 1999 a majority of local jail inmates were black or
Hispanic.  White non-Hispanics made up 41.3% of the jail
population; black non-Hispanics, 41.5%; Hispanics, 15.5%; and
other races (Asians, Pacific Islanders, American Indians, and
Alaska Natives), 1.7%.

Relative to their number of U.S. residents, black non-Hispanics
were nearly 6 times more likely than white non-Hispanics, nearly
3 times as likely as American Indians, 2« times as likely as
Hispanics, and almost 16 times more likely than Asians to have
been held in a local jail on June 30, 1999.

Over half of adult jail inmates were awaiting trial

On June 30, 1999, an estimated 54% of the Nation's adult jail
inmates were awaiting court action on their current charge.  An
estimated 278,400 inmates held in local jails were serving
a sentence in jail, awaiting sentencing, or serving time for a
probation or parole violation.

47 privately operated jails held 
nearly 14,000 inmates 

Based on the 1999 Census of Jails, 47 of the Nation's 3,365
local jails were privately owned or operated (table 8).  These
jails housed 13,814 inmates (or 2.3% of all jail inmates).  In
1993, when the last Census of Jails was conducted, 17 jails
were privately operated under contract for local governments.

Private jails were operated in 17 States -- Texas and Florida
had the most facilities (with 8), followed by Florida (5),
Pennsylvania (5), New Mexico (4) and Tennessee (3).  About 4 in
every 10 inmates housed in a private facility were housed in
Texas (3,469) or Tennessee (2,278). 

At midyear 1999, 93% of jail capacity was occupied

At midyear 1999 the rated capacity of the Nation's local jails
was an estimated 652,321, an increase of 39,541 in 12 months
(table 9).  Rated capacity is the maximum number of beds or inmates 
allocated by State or local rating officials to each jail facility.  
The growth in jail capacity during the 12-month period ending on
June 30, 1999, was the largest growth recorded since 1995 (up
41,439) and larger than the average growth of 29,239 beds every
12 months since 1990. 

As of June 30, 1999, 93% of the local jail capacity was
occupied. *** Footnote: On December 31, 1998, State prisons were
operating at between 13% and 22% above capacity, while Federal 
prisons were operating at 27% above capacity.  See Prisoners 
in 1998, August 1999, NCJ 175687.***   As a ratio of all inmates 
housed in jail facilities to total capacity, the percentage occupied 
decreased by 11 percentage points from 1990 to 1999.  At midyear 
1990 local jails operated at 4% above their rated capacity.  By midyear
1996 jail jurisdictions added a sufficient number of beds to
drop the ratio to 8% below capacity.  However, from midyear 1996
to midyear 1998 the inmate population outpaced jail capacity
growth.  In the 12 months ending June 30, 1999,  more beds than
inmates were added to the Nation's jails. 

Half of all jail inmates  were held 
in 7 States at midyear 1999

On June 30, 1999, 7 States incarcerated more than half of all
local jail inmates:  California (77,142), Texas (57,930),
Florida (51,080), New York (33,411), Georgia (32,835),
Pennsylvania (26,996), and Louisiana (25,631) (table 10).  The
10 States with the smallest jail populations each held fewer
than 3,000 inmates.  Collectively, jails in these States held
only 3.1% of the Nation's total jail population.

At midyear the total jail population exceeded jail capacity in
seven States and the District of Columbia.

In six other States, excluding Alaska, the total jail population
was below 80% of the combined capacity of all local jails.  The
lowest occupancy rates were in North Dakota (64%), South Dakota
(66%), Utah (68%), Missouri (78%), Arkansas (79%), and Kansas
(79%).

Among States, Louisiana had the highest jail incarceration rate; 
Maine, the lowest

The number of jail inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents totaled
222 on June 30, 1999.  Of the 17 States with rates greater than
that for the Nation, 11 were in the South, 4 were in the West, 
1 was in the Northeast and 1 in the Midwest.  States that had
the largest number of jail inmates per 100,000 residents were
Louisiana (585), Georgia (421), Tennessee (358), and Florida
(337).  Four States -- Maine (89), North Dakota (92), Iowa (104)
and Minnesota (105) -- had rates that were less than half of the
national rate.

Louisiana and Texas held at least 1 percent of their State
population in prison or jail 

More than 1% of residents in Louisiana and Texas were in prison
or jail at midyear 1999.  Louisiana led the Nation with 1,025
prison and jail inmates per 100,000 State residents, followed by
Texas (1,014), Georgia (956) and Oklahoma (825).  The District
of Columbia, an entirely urban jurisdiction, held 1,594 inmates
per 100,000 residents.  Vermont (203), Maine (220), Minnesota
(226), North Dakota (239), and Hawaii (291) held the fewest
inmates relative to their State populations.

Southern States had significantly higher total incarceration
rates than  States in other regions.  Nine of the 12 States with
rates higher than the national total were in the South.  Nevada
(774 inmates per 100,000 residents), Arizona (761), and
California (721) were the only States outside of the South with
rates above the national average.  The combined prison and jail
incarceration rates totaled 797 in the South, followed by 637 in
the West, 508 in the Midwest, and 504 in the Northeast. 

States also varied in the percentage of inmates held in local
jails.  Among all States at midyear 1999,  35% of inmates were
housed in local facilities.  Louisiana (with the highest
incarceration rate) also had the largest percentage housed in
local facilities (57%).  Local jails in Tennessee (55%), New
Mexico (51%), and Massachusetts (51%) also held more than half
of their State's inmates.  Excluding States with integrated
prison and jail systems,  Missouri held the largest proportion
of its inmates in its State prisons (79%), followed by Oklahoma
(76%) and Michigan (75%).  

An estimated 11% of black males in their twenties and early
thirties were in prison or jail in 1999

When total incarceration rates are estimated separately by age
group, black males in their twenties and thirties are found to
have very high rates relative to other groups.  Among the nearly
1.9 million offenders incarcerated on June 30, 1999, more than
560,000 were black males between the ages of 20 and 39 (table
12).  Expressed in terms of percentages, 12.3% of black
non-Hispanic males age 25 to 29 were in prison or jail, compared
to 4.2% of Hispanic males and about 1.5% of white males in the
same age group (table 13).  Although incarceration rates drop
with age, the percentage of black males age 45 to 54 in prison
or jail in 1999 was still nearly 3.4% -- twice the highest rate
(1.7%) among white males (age 30 to 34).

Female incarceration rates, though significantly lower than male
rates at every age, reveal similar racial and ethnic
disparities.  Black non-Hispanic females (with a prison and jail
rate of 375 per 100,000) were 2 1/2 times more likely than
Hispanic females (142 per 100,000) and 7 times more likely than
white females (53 per 100,000) to be incarcerated in 1999. 
These differences among white, black, and Hispanic females were
consistent across all age groups.

Among black non-Hispanic females, the rate was highest (1,362
per 100,000) among those age 30-34.  This rate was nearly as
large as the highest rate among white males (1,674 per 100,000).

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics (NPS)

The Bureau of Justice Statistics, with the U.S. Bureau of the
Census as its collection agent, obtains yearend and midyear
counts of prisoners from departments of correction in each of
the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Bureau
of Prisons.

In an effort to collect comparable data from all jurisdictions,
NPS distinguishes between prisoners in custody from those under
jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a State must hold
that person in one of its facilities.  To have jurisdiction, a
State has legal authority over the prisoner.  Prisoners under a
State's jurisdiction may be in the custody of a local jail,
another State's prison, or other correctional facility.  Some
States are unable to provide both custody and jurisdiction
counts.  (See National Prisoner Statistics jurisdiction notes.)

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in locally
administered confinement facilities who are under the
jurisdiction of local authorities.  NPS counts include all
inmates in State-operated facilities in Alaska, Connecticut,
Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which have combined
jail-prison systems.

Census of Jails, 1999

The 1999 Census of Jails was the seventh in a series.  Previous
censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, 1988. and
1993. As in previous censuses, the U.S. Bureau of the Census
collected the data for the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

The 1999 census included all locally administered confinement
facilities (3,318) that hold inmates beyond arraignment and are
staffed by municipal or county employees.  The census also
included 47 jails that were privately operated under contract
for local governments.  Included in the census, but excluded
from this report due to lack of comparability with previous
survey years, were 11 facilities maintained by the Federal
Bureau of Prisons and functioning as jails.

Excluded from the census were temporary holding facilities, such
as drunk tanks and police lockups, that do not hold persons
after they are formally charged in court (usually within 72
hours of arrest).  Also excluded were State-operated facilities
in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and
Vermont, which have combined jail-prison systems.  Fifteen
locally operated jails in Alaska were included.

After extensive followup, including additional mail requests and
repeated telephone contacts, all jail jurisdictions (except 6)
provided data on seven critical items -- number under
supervision by type; number of inmates by confinement status by
gender and age; average daily population; rated capacity; total
staff by payroll, non-payroll, full-time and part-time; inmate
deaths, and sex of inmate housed.  Data on these seven items for
non-responding jail jurisdictions were imputed based on data
reported in the 1993 Census of Jails.

Completed forms with data for all or most items were received
for 2,833 jail jurisdictions, resulting in a 92% response rate. 
These reporting jails housed 96% of all local jail inmates on
June 30, 1999.

Juveniles

State statutes and judicial practices allow juveniles to be
incarcerated in adult jails under a variety of circumstances. 
Because of the differing statutes and practices, however,
accurate and comparable data on juveniles are difficult to
collect.

Beginning in 1994 BJS has provided estimates of the total number
of jail inmates under age 18, the number held as adults, and the
number held as juveniles.  New sampling procedures were also
introduced in 1994 to minimize the standard errors of these
estimates.

data include jail and prison populations.

Jurisdiction counts exclude inmates held in local jails that are
operated by communities.

Arizona -- Counts are based on custody data.

California -- Beginning with the NPS-1 counts for 12/31/98,
jurisdiction counts include felons and unsentenced inmates
temporarily housed in local jails.

Connecticut -- Prisons and jails form one integrated system. 
All NPS data include jail and prison populations.

Delaware -- Prisons and jails form one integrated system.  All
NPS data include jail and prison populations.

District of Columbia -- Prisons and jails form one integrated

Jurisdiction counts exclude approximately 5,000 male inmates in
the county system (local jails and houses of correction) serving
a sentence of over 1 year.  These male inmates are included in
Massachusetts' incarceration rate.  By law, offenders in
Massachusetts may be sentenced to terms of up to 2« years in

Missouri -- Revised counts for June 30, 1998, exclude persons
under house arrest or in halfway house who were reclassified as
parolees.

Rhode Island -- Prisons and jails form one integrated system. 
All NPS data include jail and prison populations.

Tennessee -- Jurisdiction counts exclude 3,864 felons sentenced
to serve their time in local jails.  Tennessee pays to house
these felons, but the local court maintains jurisdiction.

Vermont -- Prisons and jails form an integrated system.  All NPS 
data include jail and prison populations.  Jurisdiction counts 
exclude 455 inmates on extended furlough.

Wisconsin -- Custody counts exclude inmates held in
non-Wisconsin DOC facilities under contract.
