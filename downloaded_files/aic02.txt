Foreword

This report represents a compilation and new analysis of data on the
incidents, prevalence, and consequences of violent crime among American
Indians. The report uses data from a wide variety of sources, including
statistical series maintained by the Bureau of Justice Statistics(BJS), 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Prisons (BOP), 
and the U.S. Census Bureau. 

The findings reveal a disturbing picture of the victimization of American
Indians and Alaska Natives. The rate of violent crime estimated from self
reported victimizations for American Indians is well above that of other 
U.S. racial or ethnic groups and is more than twice the national average. 
This disparity in the rates of exposure to violence affecting American 
Indians occurs across age groups, housing locations, and by gender. 

American Indians are more likely than people of other races to experience
violence at the hands of someone of a different race, and the criminal
victimizer is more likely to have consumed alcohol preceding the offense.  

In three recent BJS-sponsored tribal level criminal victimization surveys,
victims reported that alcohol use by the offender was a factor in more 
than 40% of the incidents of overall violence, and more specifically, 
domestic violence.

This study was prepared as a resource to respond to frequent inquiries and 
to update the previously published BJS analysis of the impact of crime on
American Indians. The data should be of value to those concerned about how
crime affects this segment of the U.S. population.

BJS has undertaken efforts to improve the National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS) data collection on crime and its consequences for American Indians. 
In 1999 BJS enhanced the NCVS to report statistics on victimizations 
occurring on tribal lands.

past homicide were arrested for another murder within 36 months.
-------------------------------------------

The Census 2000 implemented a new protocol for collecting race and ethnicity
data. Respondents were given the option of selecting one or more race
categories to indicate their racial identity.   

The Census 2000 question on race included 15 separate response categories and
three areas where respondents could write in a name of a racial group. The
response categories and written answers can be combined to create the
categories shown below: 

*  White
*  Black or African American 
*  American Indian or Alaska Native 
*  Asian
*  Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander
*  Some other race
*  Two or more races.

The number of people reporting one race and the number of those who reported
two or more races add to the total population.
    
Measuring criminal victimization 
among American Indians

In April 2000 American Indians accounted for 4.1 million, or 1.5%, of the
281.4 million people in the United States. This includes people who selected
American Indian or Alaska Native alone or in combination with at least one
other race category. About 2.5 million American Indians, 0.9% of the total
population, listed only one race, and 1.6 million, 0.6%, reported American
Indian in combination with one or more other races. 

American Indian and Alaska Native are terms describing a person whose origins
are in any of the original peoples of North, Central, and South America and
who maintains tribal affiliation or community attachment.***Footnote 1: Stella
U. Ogunwole, 2002, The American Indian and Alaska Native Population: 2000,
U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000 Brief, C2KBR/01-15.***   American Indian
throughout this report refers to the American Indian and Alaska Native
population.  

In Census 2000 people who identified themselves as American Indians on the
questionnaire were asked to report their enrolled or principal tribe.
Respondents could report one or more tribal affiliations. Census information
on tribal affiliation is based on self identification and therefore is not
limited to federally or state-recognized tribes or actual tribal enrollment.

American Indian tribal affiliation

American Indians in the United States belong to approximately 562 federally
recognized tribes -- as well as bands and clans -- that have a distinct
history, culture, and often a separate language.***Footnote 2: Information on
the federally recognized tribes can be found in the Federal Register, Vol. 68,
No. 234, December 5, 2003, entitled Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to
Receive Service from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of
the Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs, issued by the Office of Management and
Budget.***

In 2000 about 79% of American Indians who reported a single race reported a
specific tribe and 21% did not.***Footnote 3: U.S. Census Bureau, Census 2000
Summary File 1.*** Among those who reported American Indian in combination
with another race, 67% specified a tribal affiliation and 33% did not. 

The 10 largest American Indian tribal groupings -- based on respondents who
reported American Indian or Alaska Native alone and their tribal affiliation
-- accounted for 47.5% of the 2.5 million respondents. ***Footnote 4: Tribal
grouping refers to the combining of individual American Indian tribes, such 
as Fort Sill Apache, Mescalero Apache, Payson Tonto Apache, and White Mountain
Apache into the general Apache tribe, or the combining of individual Alaska
Native tribes such as American Eskimo, Eskimo, and Greenland Eskimo into the
general Eskimo tribe.***

Over 20% of the American Indian population identifying one race reported
tribal affiliation with the Cherokee or Navajo tribes.

American Indians and geographic distribution

Most States with the highest percentage of American Indian residents had that
distinction for all of the 20th century. Eight of the ten States with the
highest percentage of American Indians in 1900 were also among the top 10 in
1950 and 1990.

Because of the changes to the data on race in Census 2000, the data are not
comparable to data from the 1990 or earlier censuses.

In 2000 nearly 1.6 million people who reported their race as American Indian
alone lived in 10 States. California had the largest number of American Indian
residents, who made up about 1% (reporting one race)to 2% (two or more races)
of the State's total population. 

Alaska had the largest proportion of the State's total residents identified
as American Indian with nearly 16% reporting one race and 19% reporting two 
or more. 
 
The median age (28 years) of the American Indian population (alone) in 2000
was nearly 7 years younger than the median for U.S. residents and nearly 10
years younger than that for whites.

The Census 2000 population counts for the American Indian population (alone)
are used for comparison through the remainder of this report. The use of the
race (alone) count allows for the most reliable comparison with findings on
American Indians and crime prior to the change in Census data collection
on race. For example, the National Criminal Victimization Survey allows
respondents to identify one race category for the data collection period, 
1992 to 2001.

National Crime Victimization Survey   
                   
The NCVS collects information on the Nation's experience with crime. These
data provide demographic characteristics of the victims, including age,
gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, income, and educational level,
and the offenders' characteristics as reported by the victim. 

As administered during 1992-2001, respondents in the NCVS selected a single
race identifier: white, black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Asian and
Pacific Islander, or other. (NCVS reports ethnicity -- Hispanic or
non-Hispanic -- separately.) American Indians represented about 0.5% of those
interviewed from 1992 to 2001.

The NCVS provides estimates for the violent crimes of rape, sexual assault,
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault for persons age 12 or older.
The characteristics of victimizations include time and place, weapon use, self
protection, injury and medical care, victim-offender relationship, and
economic losses.

NCVS data for 1992 to 2001 were aggregated to provide enough cases to generate
annual average crime victimization estimates for American Indians and Alaska
Natives.***Footnote 5: See Methodology on page 43 for a description of
computation of annual averages.***   

Annually, during 1992 to 2001 American Indians experienced on average
116,000 violent crimes of the estimated total 9.1 million occurring among
all racial groups. NCVS victimization data for 1992 to 2001 indicate that
American Indians accounted for an average of about 1.3% of all violent
victimizations annually.

The annual average violent crime rate among American Indians from 1992 to 2001
(101 per 1,000 person age 12 or older) was about 2½ times the national rate
(41 per 1,000 persons).

The annual average violent crime rate among American Indians was twice as high
as that of blacks (50 per 1,000 persons), 2½ times higher than that for whites
(41 per 1,000 persons), and 4½ times that for Asians (22 per 1,000 persons).

American Indians made up about 1.3% of all victims of violence, more than
double their 0.5% represented in the NCVS sample. Blacks also have higher
representation among victims of violence (14.7%) than their proportion of the
population age 12 or older (12.1%). Whites and Asians have lower
representation of violent victimizations relative to their proportions of the
general population. 

From 1992 to 2001 the annual average per capita rate of violent victimization
translates into 1 violent crime for every 24 residents age 12 or older. Per
capita rates vary by race. American Indians experienced approximately 1
violent crime for every 10 residents age 12 or older, compared to 1 violent
victimization for every 20 blacks, 1 for every 25 whites, and 1 for every 45
Asian residents.

Types of violent crime            

On average during 1992-2001, American Indians age 12 or older experienced
annually an estimated 100,500 simple and aggravated assaults, 9,600 robberies,
and 5,900 rapes or sexual assaults.  

American Indians were twice as likely to experience a rape/sexual assault
(5 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older) compared to all races (2 per 1,000).  

The annual average robbery rate for the Nation was 5 per 1,000 residents age
12 or older from 1992 to 2001. American Indians (8 per 1,000)experienced
robberies at double the rate for whites (4 per 1,000) but at a more similar
rate for blacks (10 per 1,000).

The annual average aggravated and simple assault rates among American Indians
were more than double the rates for the Nation. American Indians experienced
aggravated assaults at a rate of 25 per 1,000 Nearly 3 million victims a year
perceived the use of alcohol by the violent offenders who victimized them,
1992-95persons, compared to 9 per 1,000 for all races. For simple assaults
American Indians (61 per 1,000) were victims twice as often as whites
(27 per 1,000) and blacks (26 per 1,000).

The distribution of types of violent crimes experienced by American Indians
was similar to that of the other racial groups across the Nation. The most
common type of violent victimization among American Indians, as among all
groups, was simple assault (61%). According to NCVS estimates, among violent
crimes reported by American Indians, 25%were aggravated assaults; 8%,
robberies; and 5%, rapes/sexual assaults.

Gender, age, and location of residence 
of victims of violent crime

During 1992-2001 the yearly average violent crime rates were 49 per 1,000
males age 12 or older and 35 per 1,000 females. The violent crime rate among
American Indian males was 118 per 1,000, more than double the overall rate. 

The rate of violent crime victimization among American Indian females
(86 per 1,000) was 2½ times the rate for all females. The victimization
rate among American Indian females was much higher than that found
among black females (46 per 1,000 age 12 or older), about 2½ times
higher than that among white females (34), and 5 times that of Asian (17)
females.

In the four younger age groups, from 12 to 44, the violent crime rate was
higher for American Indians than for all races. The violent crime
victimization rate was highest (155 per 1,000 persons) for American Indians
age 18 to 24, compared to the highest rate in the 12-to-17-age group for all
races (94 per 1,000). 

Among persons in the 55 or older category, the American Indian violent crime
rate was 22 per 1,000 versus the overall rate of 8 per 1,000.

Just under half the violent crimes committed against American Indians occurred
among those age 12 to 24, a pattern similar across racial groups. 

Victim-offender relationship

Among American Indian victims of violence, the offender was more likely to be
a stranger than an intimate partner, family member, or acquaintance. Strangers
committed 42% of the violent crimes against American Indians during 1992-2001.
An acquaintance committed about 1 in 3 of the violent victimizations against
American Indians. About 1 in 5 violent victimizations among American Indians
involved an offender who was an intimate or family member of the victim. 

American Indian victims described the offender as a stranger in 71% of
robberies, 48% of aggravated assaults, and 41% of rapes/sexual assaults.
American Indian victims of simple assault (39%) more often reported the
offender was an acquaintance. 

Race of offender

White or black offenders committed 88% of all violent victimizations,
1992-2001. Victims identified Asians or American Indians -- classified as
other race by NCVS -- as the offender in 13% of the violent acts.

When asked the race of their offender, American Indian victims of violent
crime primarily said the offender was white (57%), followed by other race
(34%)and black (9%).

Violent crime against white and black victims was primarily intraracial,
committed by a person of the same race. Among the white victims of violence,
70% of the offenders were white, and among black victims, 80% were black.

American Indian victims were more likely to report the offender was from
a different race, compared to blacks and  white victims.

In 66% of the violent crimes in which the race of the offender was reported,
American Indian victims indicated the offender was either white or black.
Nearly 4 in 5 American Indian victims of rape/sexual assault described the
offender as white. About 3 in 5 American Indian victims of robbery (57%),
aggravated assault (58%), and simple assault (55%)described the offender as
white. 

The offender was described as black for about 1 in 10 incidents of
rapes/sexual assaults (8%), aggravated assaults (10%), and simple
assault (9%), and about 2 in 5 robberies (17%) against American Indian
victims. 

The less serious the offense, the higher was the percentage of American Indian
victims describing the offender's race as other than black or white. 

Alcohol, drugs, and crime

Alcohol (33%) or drug (10%) use, or use of both (9%), was a factor in 51% of
the violent crimes against all races. Differences can be found by race in the
victims' perceptions of alcohol and drug use by offenders. Among victims of
violence who were able to describe alcohol or drug use by offenders, American
Indians (71%) were more likely than any other racial group to report an
offender under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs. 

Overall, American Indian victims reported alcohol use by 62% of the offenders,
compared to 42% for all races. In violent crimes experienced by American
Indians where use was known, the offender was under the influence of alcohol
(48%), drugs (9%), or both (14%).

Weapon use and violent crime

On average, American Indians faced an offender with a weapon in about a third
of the violent crime incidents from 1992 to 2001. In almost 70% of the violent
crimes experienced by American Indians, the offender did not use a weapon. 

About 11% of American Indian victims faced an offender with a firearm. Nearly
6% of the American Indian victims encountered a knife, and about 7% were
victimized with a blunt object or other weapon. 

Uniform Crime Reporting Program, 
Supplementary Homicide Reports, 
1976-2001

Findings about homicide come from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program,
Supplementary Homicide Reports, of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 

Murder among American Indians

On average from 1976 to 2001, each year about 144 American Indians were
murdered. American Indians represented 0.7% of all murder victims nationwide,
similar to their 0.9% share of the population. 

An estimated 3,738 American Indians were murdered from 1976 to 2001. Detail 
is available for about 3,208 American Indian murder victims or about 91% of
the total from 1976 to 1999. The remaining analysis is based on those detailed
cases. About 73% of all American Indian murder victims were males.

Geography and American Indian murders

During the 24-year period, 1976-1999, about 75% of all murders of American
Indians occurred in 10 States in which 61% of the American Indian population
resided in 2000. 

Nearly 25% (799) of all American Indian murders occurred in California and
Oklahoma. Just over 13% of all American Indian murder victims were in
California, which also accounted for 14% of the American Indian population
nationwide. Oklahoma had 12% of all American Indian murder victims, a
proportion similar to the State's percentage (11%) of the Nation's American
Indian population. 

In five States, Alaska (28%), North Carolina (2%), Washington (4%), Minnesota
(7%), and Oregon (3%) the proportion of murder victims who were American
Indian exceeded their proportion of each State's resident population.

About 1 in 4 of the murder victims in Alaska from 1976 to 1999 were American
Indians. Alaska accounted for about 10% of all murdered American Indians and
had 4% of the Nation's American Indian population. American Indians in Alaska
made up about 16% of the State's total resident population and 28% of the
murder victims.    

Rates of murder

The American Indian murder rate showed a 45% decline from about 6.6 victims
per 100,000 in 1995 to 3.6 in 2001.

Race of murderers

During 1976 to 1999 in most murder cases involving a white or black victim,
the offender was the same race as the victim . For example, 86% of white
murder victims and 94% of black murder victims were murdered by an offender 
of their respective race.

By comparison, American Indians (58%) and Asians (60%) were somewhat less
likely to be murdered by an offender of their own race. In about 32% of the
cases, American Indians were murdered by a white offender; in 10%, by a 
black; and in 1%, by an Asian.

Murder victim-offender relationship                   
 
Strangers accounted for 17% of American Indian murders. American Indian
offenders committed about 1% of all murders from 1976 to 1999 when a prior
relationship -- family member or acquaintance -- existed with the victim.
American Indians, like other racial groups, were more likely 

November 19, 20045:42pm(66%) to be victims of intraracial homicide when the
murderer was a relative or acquaintance.

A third of American Indians murdered by an acquaintance or relative were
killed by a member of a different race. 

About half of the American Indians murdered by a stranger were killed by a
white; a quarter by a black offender.  

Arrests of American Indians

In 2001 State and local law enforcement agencies made an estimated 433,764
arrests for violent crimes (murder/non negligent manslaughter, forcible rape,
robbery, and aggravated assault). 

American Indians accounted for about 1% of those arrests -- an estimated 
4,345 arrests. 

Between 1992 and 2001 the violent crime arrest rate of American Indians
declined 26%. In 1992 the violent crime arrest rate was 216 arrests per
100,000 American Indians, and in 2001, 159 per 100,000. The total number of
American Indian arrests for violent crimes increased 1.7% from 2000 to 2001. 

Among arrestees of all ages, the violent crime arrest rate for American
Indians (159 per 100,000) was similar to the rate for all races (152 per
100,000). Compared to all races, American Indians were less likely (16 to 
27 arrests per 100,000) to be arrested for robbery but more likely (131 to
116) to be arrested for aggravated assault.

Slightly less than 14% of American Indians arrested for violent offenses in
2001 were under age 18, similar to 15% of all violent crime arrestees (not
shown in a table). For violent crimes except murder, American Indians age 17
or under were less likely to be arrested than youth of all races. 

Alcohol related arrests

In 2001 the arrest rate among American Indians for alcohol violations --
driving under the influence (DUI), liquor law violations, and drunkenness --
was double the national rate. About 1,240 American Indians per 100,000 of 
the population were arrested for alcohol violations, compared to 623 per
100,000 of all persons. American Indian youth age 17 or under likewise had
an alcohol violation arrest rate (681) nearly double that of youth of all
races (362). 

------------------------------------------
Gangs in Indian country

Youth gang activity in Indian communities is a relatively recent
phenomena, according to data provided by the National Youth
Gang Center.***Footnote 6:  Office of Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention, Youth Gangs in Indian Country , March
2004 (NCJ 202714). The web location is 
<http://www.ncjrs.org/pdffiles1/ojjdp/ 202714.pdf>.*** The 2000
Survey of Youth Gangs (SYGIC) in Indian country collected
information on the presence and effect of youth gang activity
within Indian communities.  

Overall, about half (52%) of the selected Indian communities completed 
the survey, with about 23% (40) indicating an active gang problem in 
their community (not shown in a table). The SYGIC also provides 
estimates of members, causes, gangs in school, gang migration, crime
involvement, and influence on the community.

American Indians in the Federal 
justice system

United States attorneys prosecute violations of Federal laws in Indian
country. Section 1153 of U.S. Title 18 grants jurisdiction to Federal 
courts over Indians who commit any of the crimes listed under the Major 
Crimes Act of 1885, regardless of whether the victim was an Indian or
non-Indian.***Footnote 7: 18 U.S.C. sec 1153. Some exemptions apply in PL 
280 jurisdictions and where other unique statutes impact Indian country.***

At the Federal level "Indian country"  means all land within the limits 
of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States
Government, including all dependent communities and Indian allotments 
as described in 18 USC sec 1151. 

Data on suspects investigated and charged in U.S. district court come from 
the BJS Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP). The data do not identify
the race of suspects but do identify whether the offense occurred in Indian
country. The Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys constructed the original
database using its Central System File, fiscal year 2000.

Investigations

Criminal referrals or "matters" are submitted to the U.S. attorneys by Federal
investigative agencies -- Drug Enforcement Agency, FBI, and Bureau of Indian
Affairs -- and State and local investigative agencies. The U.S. attorney
decides the appropriateness of bringing criminal charges and may initiate
prosecution. 

In fiscal year 2000 U.S. attorneys investigated an estimated 123,559 suspects
in matters from across the United States for violation of Federal laws. Just
under 2% (2,074) were for alleged offenses occurring in Indian country.

About 6,036 of all new suspects in 2000 were investigated for violent
offenses.***Footnote 8:  Bureau of Justice Statistics, Compendium of 
Federal Justice Statistics, 2000,
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cfjs00.htm>.*** The 1,525
suspects investigated for violent offenses in Indian country represented 
25% of all Federal investigation for violent offenses in fiscal year 2000.

Violent crimes were the majority of offenses investigated by U.S. attorneys 
in Indian country in fiscal year 2000. Just under 75% of suspects investigated
in Indian country involved a violent crime, compared to the national total of
5%.

The number of Indian country suspects investigated by U.S. attorneys for
violence declined 21% from 1,927 in 1997 to 1,525 in 2000. 

In 2000 about 25% of the Indian country suspects were investigated for
property, drug, or other offenses.

The majority of suspects investigated from Indian country were in the judicial
districts of South Dakota, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana, and North Dakota.
About half of the total 2,074 investigations were in the judicial districts 
of South Dakota and Arizona. 

Charges filed

At the conclusion of the investigation of a criminal matter, U.S. attorneys
may decline prosecution, file criminal charges in a U.S. district court, or
refer the matter to a U.S. magistrate or a State jurisdiction. 

In fiscal year 2000, U.S. attorneys filed 77,990 criminal cases in all Federal
district courts. About 1% (924) of all the cases filed involved cases in
Indian country.
    
About 3,688 charges for violent offenses were filed in U.S. district court
during fiscal year 2000. The 677 Indian country cases represented about 18% 
of all defendants charged with a violent crime.

Among Indian country offenses, violent crimes accounted for the majority of
the offenses charged during fiscal year 2000. An estimated 73% of all charges
filed in U.S. district courts for Indian country offenses were for violent
crimes, compared to the national total of about 5%. 

Compared to the number of Federal district court filings for violent crimes
(60,403) in fiscal year 1997, the fiscal year 2000 estimate (77,990)
represented a 29% increase in 3 years. The number of charges filed against
American Indians for violent crimes increased 27% from 1997 to 2000.

Indian country suspects were more likely to be charged in U.S. district 
court for violent crimes relative to other offenses. About 27% of the 
Indian country suspects charged with offenses in U.S. district court in 
2000 were for property, drug, or other offenses. 

About 3 in 5 criminal cases (924) filed in U.S. district court in Indian
country during fiscal year 2000 were in the judicial districts of Arizona
(202), South Dakota (176), Montana (113), and New Mexico (107) (not shown 
in a table). 

American Indians entering Federal prisons   
    
Between fiscal years 1994 and 2001, on an annual average, about 751 American
Indians entered Federal prison following convictions for violent offenses.

These data come from the BJS Federal Justice Statistics Program, using a
database constructed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).***Footnote 9: 
BJS, Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, 2001, November 2003 (NCJ
201627)See <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cfjs01.htm>.***

In 2001 BOP was responsible for the confinement of over 171,000 offenders. In
fiscal year 2001 about 69,900 offenders entered Federal prison. An estimated
2.4% (1,662) of the offenders entering Federal prison were American Indians.

About 5,881 violent offenders entered Federal prison during fiscal year 2001.
American Indians were 16% (913) of all offenders entering Federal prison for
violent crimes. The American Indian proportion of all violent offenders
entering Federal prison has remained stable since 1996 -- about 15%.

American Indians were more likely to be serving a sentence for a violent
offense than Federal prisoners of other races. In fiscal year 2001, 55% of
American Indians entering Federal prison were serving a sentence for a 
violent crime, compared to 4% of white offenders, 13% of black offenders, 
and 5% of Asian offenders.

Recidivism among American Indian 
prisoners released in 1994
         
BJS conducted a study of recidivism among persons released from prisons in 
15 States, accounting for two-thirds of all released State prisoners in
1994.***Footnote 10: BJS, Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 1994, June 2002
(NCJ 193427). See <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/rpr94.htm>. ***

This study followed a sample drawn to represent 272,111 former inmates 
for 3 years after their release.

It measured their rates of arrest, conviction, sentencing to prison, and
reincarceration (with or without a new sentence). 

An estimated 1,712 of the former inmates in this study were American Indians,
about 1.0% of all the inmates in the study. The American Indian inmates were
discharged from prisons in 12 of the 15 States in the study:

Arizona      Maryland     New York
California   Michigan     North Carolina
Florida      Minnesota    Ohio
Illinois     New Jersey   Oregon


The American Indians were in prison for a variety of offenses, virtually all
felonies. Nearly 27% of the American Indians leaving prison in 1994 served
time for violent offenses, 32% for property offenses, 18% for drugs, and 22%
for public-order offenses. 

American Indian recidivism rates at 
different lengths of time after release

Within the first 6 months of their release, 26% of the 1,712 American Indian
offenders were arrested for new crime -- a felony or serious misdemeanor.

By the end of 36 months from their release, an estimated 60% of the 1,712
American Indians were arrested, 47% convicted, and 21% sentenced to prison 
for a new felony or serious misdemeanor.

Most new arrests and convictions occurred within the first year of release.
About 45% were arrested again within 1 year, and 25% were convicted for a 
new crime. 

Arrest. An estimated 60% of American Indians released from prison in 1994 were
arrested for a new crime within 3 years. Fifty-three percent of the American
Indians released for violent offenses were arrested for a new 
crime.

Conviction. A total of 47% of the American Indians released from prison in
1994 were convicted in State or Federal court for a new crime within 3 year.
About 40% of American Indian violent offenders leaving prison were convicted
for a new crime of any type.

Sentenced to prison for new crime.  About 1 in 5 American Indians released
from prison in 1994 were sentenced to a new prison term for the commission 
of a new felony or serious misdemeanor. An estimated 16% of American Indians
released from prison in 1994 for a violent offense were sentenced to prison
for a new crime within 3 years.

Returned to prison with or without a new sentence. More than half of American
Indians released from prison in 1994 were back in prison because they received
another sentence or because they violated a technical condition of their
release -- for example, failing a drug test, failing to meet their parole
officer, or being rearrested for a new crime. 

Past violent crimes and recidivism

Twenty-nine percent of the American Indian violent offenders released in 1994
were arrested for a new violent offense (not shown in table). Within 3 years
of release, about 15% of the 75 American Indian violent offenders released for
murder were arrested for another murder. 

American Indians and capital 
punishment, 1973-2002    
    
Capital punishment data are collected annually as part of the National
Prisoner Statistics program. Data collected on persons under sentence of 
death are obtained from the department of corrections in each jurisdiction
authorizing capital punishment. Information on the status of death penalty
inmates is reported as of the last day of the calendar year. Data include
Federal inmates. 

Over the period 1973-2002, 7,254 persons were sentenced to death in the United
States; 60 were American Indians.

Between 1977 and 2002, a total of 820 persons were executed, including 8
American Indians (1% of those executed).

Among the 7,254 persons sentenced to death, 3,557 were still under a death
sentence at the end of 2002 -- 49% of those entering death row over the
period. For American Indians, 27 of the 60 (45%) sentenced to death between
1973 and 2002 still remained under a death sentence at the close of 2002.

About half of all death sentences imposed on American Indians from 1973 to
2002 were in North Carolina (15) and Oklahoma (16). As of December 31, 2002,
North Carolina (7) had the largest number of American Indians under a 
sentence of death.

Forty-two percent of American Indians ever under a sentence of death,
1973-2002, were removed from death row by means other than execution.

About 40% (24) of the American Indians sentenced to death from 1973-2002 
had their sentence overturned or commuted.

Indian country criminal justice 

Data on tribal law enforcement and jails in Indian country come from the
Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies and the Survey of Jails 
in Indian Country.

Tribal law enforcement

In 2000 American Indian tribes operated 171 law enforcement
agencies.***Footnote 11:  BJS, Tribal Law Enforcement, 2000, January 2003 
(NCJ 197936).  See <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/tle00.htm>.***

Tribally operated law enforcement agencies in Indian country employed a 
total of 2,303 full-time sworn officers: 

*  The five largest tribally operated law enforcement agencies vary in
reservation land area, as well as in the number of full-time sworn 
personnel per 100 square miles.

*  About 88% of the tribally operated law enforcement agencies participated 
in crime prevention activities and executed arrest warrants (not shown in
table). 

*  About 1 in 4 tribal police agencies operated one or more jails.

Jails in Indian country

American Indian tribes and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of
Interior, operate 70 jails in tribal areas. In 2002 these confinement
facilities, detention centers, or other correctional facilities had a rated
capacity to house about 2,177 adult and juvenile inmates.  

On June 28, 2002, 2,080 American Indians were under correctional supervision
in Indian country facilities.***Footnote 12: BJS, Jails in Indian Country,
2002, (NCJ 198997). See <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/jic02.htm>.***  About
2,006 (96%) of the American Indians under correctional supervision in
Indian country were inmates, and 74 (4%) were under community supervision
(which included probation and parole). 

A total of 711 jail operation staff -- correctional officers, guards,
and other staff who spent more than 50% of their time supervising
inmates -- worked in the jails in Indian country on June 28, 2002.
The average guard-to-inmate ratio for all tribes in Indian country is

one jail staff member to three inmates. Five reporting jails had a
guard-to-inmate ratio of 1 to 10 or higher. 

The majority (86%) of the offenders were confined in Indian country jails for
misdemeanors. About 20% (408) of the offenders were held for nondomestic
violent offenses. Approximately 11% or 226 of the offenders in Indian country
jails were confined for a DWI or DUI (either drugs or alcohol).

Juvenile jails in Indian country

Among the 70 jails (confinement facilities, detention centers, or other
correctional facilities) in tribal areas, 10 jails were designated as 
juvenile November 19, 20045:42pmfacilities. On June 28, 2002, the juvenile
facilities were supervising 180 juveniles and 5 adults being held for the
Federal Bureau of Prisons.

The 10 juvenile facilities had a rated capacity to hold 341 inmates. On 
June 28, 2002, the juvenile jails were operating at 54% of capacity. As 
in all other jails in Indian country, a majority (62%) of the offenders 
were held for misdemeanors. About 10% of the inmates in the juvenile jails
were held for felonies and 29% for other offenses, which include status
offenses, unknown charges, and court orders.
 
A total of 188 jail correctional officers and other staff who spent more 
than 50% of their time supervising inmates worked in the juvenile jails. 
The average officer to inmate ratio for all juvenile jails was one-to-one.
Several tribes had more officers than inmates at midyear 2002.

Highlights:  Tribal criminal victimization

The Umatilla Indian Reservation

*  About 90 respondents from the Umatilla Indian Reservation said they had
experienced a violent crime over the prior 12 months.

*  More than half of the victims of violence in the Umatilla tribal
reservation reported alcohol use by their offender.

The Southern Ute Indian Reservation

*  About 58 SUIT respondents said they had experienced 106 violent crimes 
over a prior 12 months.

*  49 of the 106 SUIT victims of violence reported alcohol and/or drug use 
by the offender.

The Zuni Pueblo Indian Reservation1

*  About 30% of the Zuni Pueblo Indian respondents indicated they had been
victims of domestic partner violence in the previous 12 months.

*  Among the victims of domestic violence, respondents were more likely to
identify emotional or physical abuse than stalking or sexual abuse.

Summary report of three American 
Indian criminal victimization 
surveys   
                   
Introduction

Because of size and design, nationally representative surveys such as the 
NCVS do not provide estimates of crime and victimization for individual
American Indian tribes or Alaska Native villages. 
    
To address this information gap, BJS awarded three grants to study the
characteristics and circumstances of violent victimization in selected 
Indian country jurisdictions. These surveys were specifically designed 
to capture data about the role of alcohol in violent victimizations and 
the characteristics of domestic violence.  The surveys covered three 
American Indian jurisdictions: 

*  Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation(CTUIR)

*  Southern Ute Indian Tribe(SUIT) 

*  Zuni Pueblo Indian Tribe 

The results of the individual criminal victimization surveys cannot provide
generalizations about the entire American Indian reservation population or
even other parts of Indian country, but they do provide a view of violent
crime as experienced by the respondents in the participating tribes. 
Although not based on a probability sample, each local tribal survey
incorporated the methodological approach most conducive to the reservation
under study and accessibility to tribal members.  

The following provides a synopsis of each of the three studies. Detailed
findings and complete datasets can be obtained by contacting the organization
that conducted the studies (see page 41 for contact information).

Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla 
Indian Reservation (CTUIR)Criminal 
Victimization Survey
    
The National Indian Justice Center conducted a victimization survey among the
Confederated Tribes on the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) in northeastern
Oregon. The CTUIR is a federally recognized tribe with an estimated
reservation population of 2,400 tribal members.***Footnote 13: CTUIR, See
<www.umatilla.nsn.us>***The Umatilla Reservation spans a total of nearly
172,140 acres.***Footnote 14: Veronica Tiller, Tiller's Guide to Indian
Country (1996).***   

Three primary tribal groups of American Indians compose the CTUIR: Cayuse,
Umatilla, and Walla Walla tribes. Residents from other American Indian tribes
and non-Indians also live on the CTUIR.

Methodology The CTUIR survey collected information about incidence,
prevalence, and characteristics of violent crimes as viewed by respondents. 

Data were collected on the tribal affiliation of American Indians living on 
or near the reservation, the role of alcohol and drugs in victimizations, 
and reporting to police by victims. 

The study design did not include probability sampling. Based on the purpose 
of the study and the amount of access to the tribal population, the most
effective method of obtaining responses from across the tribe was an
advertisement in the free and widely read tribal newspaper Umatilla Journal.

One hundred and three American Indians age 18 or older, living on or near the
CTUIR, took part in the survey. The following analysis excludes non-Indian
respondents. The CTUIR survey respondents represented about 9% of the total
population of American Indians living on or near the CTUIR.

The majority (64%) of the survey respondents were members of the CTUIR --
Cayuse, Umatilla, and Walla Walla tribes. 

Three other groups of American Indian respondents were represented in the
study. Yakama (12%), Nez Perce (10%), and other American Indians described 
as all other tribes (15%) live on or near the CTUIR. All other tribes 
included Blackfeet, Cherokee, Cocopah, Colville, Grand Ronde, Navajo, Ponca,
Shoshone-Paiute Duck Valley, Spokane, Warm Springs, and Yorok.

The CTUIR study provides measures of violent victimizations (categorized as
nondomestic violent crimes and domestic violent crimes), and property crimes.
Property crimes are not analyzed in this report.  

Violent victimization is a combined category of all violent crimes
(non-domestic and domestic) occurring within the previous 12 months.

Survey respondents reported a total of 88 violent victimizations during the
previous 12 months. Almost two-thirds of all respondents indicated they had
been victims of a violent crime. Twenty-one of the victims had experienced
both domestic and nondomestic violence.

The Umatilla were victims in about 52 of the reported violent victimizations;
the Yakama in 8, the Nez Perce in 13, and all other tribes in 15.

Gender, age, and location of residence 
of victims of violent crime

CTUIR American Indian males were victims of violent crimes in 34% of the
victimizations reported by the participants. Umatilla Indian males reported
more violent victimizations than males from other tribes. The Nez Perce 
living on or near the CTUIR were the only tribe with more male than female
participants and the only tribe in which males reported more violent
victimizations than females. The majority (66%) of the reported 88 violent
victimizations were committed against women. 

Among age groups, the largest number of participants who reported
victimizations were between ages 35 and 44 (29). 

More survey participants age 18 or older who reported being victimized resided
in the rural areas (34) of the CTUIR, followed by those in government
sponsored housing (29) and those living off the reservation (22).

The majority (59%) of the 88 victimizations reported in the CTUIR study were
nondomestic violent crimes.

Nondomestic violent crimes in this study referred to assaults, sexual assault,
battery, and threats/intimidation by someone other than an adult family or
household member. Domestic violence included the same offenses committed by an
adult family or household member.***Footnote 15:  Definition comes from the
Statutes of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, July
1999 Compilation, Volume 1, Criminal Code sec 75A-Domestic Abuse.***

Over half (34) of all nondomestic violent crimes were perpetrated against
Umatilla tribe members, compared to 18 against all other Indians living on or
near the CTUIR. The same pattern held for domestic violence victimizations,
with Umatilla participants reporting half the total.

Alcohol related violent victimizations

In about 3 in 5 of all violent victimizations, the victims indicated they knew
or reasonably suspected the perpetrator was drinking alcohol. About 31 out of
52 nondomestic victimizations were committed by an offender drinking alcohol
(not shown in table). Among all domestic violence victims, most (22 out of 36)
said the perpetrator was drinking. About 62% of the participants reporting
victimization by alcohol related violence said they lived with the offender. 

Southern Ute Indian Tribe (SUIT) 
Community Safety Survey

The Southern Ute Indian Tribe (SUIT) is a federally recognized tribe with an
estimated reservation population of 1,500 tribal members. The Southern Ute
Indian (SUI) Reservation spans about 818,000 acres.***Footnote 16: Veronica
Tiller, Tiller's Guide to Indian Country (1996) and
<http://www.southern-ute.nsn.us>. *** 

The term Southern Ute in this report denotes respondents who identified
themselves as being Southern Ute Indian, Ute Mountain Ute, or Northern Ute.
The SUI Reservation has Indians from other tribes and non-Indians living on 
or near the reservation.

Methodology The SUIT criminal victimization study collected information on 
the prevalence and characteristics of crime and victimization occurring on 
the SUI Reservation. It also collected information on the tribal affiliation
of the American Indians living on or near the reservation, perceptions about
crime in general, the role of alcohol and drug use in victimizations, and
victim's reports of crimes to police. 

The survey design involved sampling all SUIT members who appeared on the
tribal enrollment roster. Voluntary participation was encouraged from
respondents across the SUI Reservation by an advertisement placed in the
tribal newspaper The Drum and aired on the tribal radio station KSUT. A $10
monetary incentive was also offered.

Three hundred and twelve Indians (269 Southern Ute and 43 non-Southern Ute
Indians) age 18 or older, living on or near the SUI Reservation, took part 
in the data collection. 

Data on non-Indians have been excluded from this summary. The SUIT respondents
represent about 30% of the total target population age 18 or older living on
or near the SUI Reservation.

The SUIT survey also provides measures of violent victimization, both domestic
and nondomestic. However, the conceptual measures are not comparable to the
CTUIR since each study used different question formats, sampling procedures,
and methods of data collection. The victimizations reported have been coded to
reflect similar categories to allow for consistent presentation of the data.
         
Fewer than 1 in 5 of the respondents who participated in the SUIT study
indicated they were victims of any kind of violent crime within the past 12
months. SUIT data show that between 2001 and 2002 about 58 American Indian
respondents 18 or older living on or near the SUI Reservation reported being
victimized in the last year. 

Violent victimization in this study includes incidences of threats with a
weapon, assaults, and sexual assaults by persons who may or may not reside
with the victims. Of the total number of victims (58), 23 indicated they 
were victims of multiple violent offenses.

The victims reported a total of 106 violent victimizations as defined by the
study occurring within the previous 12 months. The SUIT study allowed the
respondents to report multiple incidents of several types of crime.

The Southern Ute, who comprised most of the respondents, also accounted for
most of the violent victimizations reported. Southern Ute Tribal members were
victims in about 88 of the violent victimizations reported by participants; 
18 violent victimizations were reported by American Indians from "other 
Indian tribes."

Gender, age, and victims' location 
of residence 

SUIT males reported less than a third of all the violent victimizations. A
total of 32 victimizations were reported by males age 18 or older on the SUI
Reservation. 

SUIT females reported the majority of the violent victimizations within the
previous 12 months. A total of 74 violent crimes were committed against 
women of the SUIT age 18 or older. Women were over-represented among the 
study respondents. 

Among age groups, 46 violent crime victims were between ages 18 and 29. The
Southern Ute (35) and American Indians from other tribes (11) both had the
highest number of victimizations reported for persons ages 18-29, followed 
by those ages 30-40.

Almost half (52) of the SUIT participants age 18 or older who reported being
victimized resided on the reservation. 
    
Types of violent crime on the SUI 
Reservation    
    
Seven in ten of the 106 victimizations reported in the SUIT study were
nondomestic violent crimes.

These nondomestic violent crimes in the SUIT survey includes assaults, sexual
assaults or rapes, battery, and threats with a weapon by someone other than 
an adult family or household member. Domestic violence includes the same
offenses committed by an adult family or household member.

The SUIT participants reported 74 "nondomestic violent victimizations" and 32
of the victimizations described as domestic violence. The Indians of the SUI
Reservation reported twice as many nondomestic violent crimes as domestic
victimizations. 

Over half (58) of all "nondomestic violent victimizations" reported were
perpetrated against Southern Ute tribe members, compared to 16 for all other
American Indians living on or near the reservation.  A similar pattern held
for domestic violence victimizations, with Southern Ute participants reporting
the majority of the victimizations committed by a person living in the home
with the victim.

Alcohol related violent victimizations

In 49 of the 106 violent victimizations reported, the victims indicated they
knew or reasonably suspected that the perpetrator was on drugs or drinking
alcohol at the time of the victimization. 

Zuni Pueblo Indian Reservation 
Criminal Victimization Survey 

The American Indian Development Associates conducted a Criminal Victimization
Survey (CVS) on the Zuni Pueblo Indian Reservation, located in northwest New
Mexico. The Pueblo of Zuni is a federally recognized tribe with an estimated
tribal enrollment of 9,800 and resident population of 11,000. The Zuni
reservation covers approximately 407,247 acres.***Footnote 18: eronica Tiller,
Tiller's Guide to Indian Country (1996).***

The Zuni CVS obtained information about incidents, prevalence, and
characteristics of violent crimes as viewed from respondents who completed the
survey. While this study may not be used to make generalizations for all of
Indian country, it provides a view of violent crime as experienced by the
participants. 

About 691 American Indians age 13 or older, living on or near the Zuni Pueblo
Indian Reservation took part in the survey. The Zuni CVS respondents
represented about 10% of the total population of American Indians living on 
or near the reservation. About half of the surveys were self administered, 
and half were face-to-face interviews.

This study provides measures of violent victimization, both domestic and
nondomestic, and property crimes. Violent victimization is a measure of the
total number of violent crimes, including nondomestic violence and domestic
violence occurring during a 12-month period and reported by American Indians
living on or near the Zuni reservation.

About 173 (25%) respondents were victims in 518 incidents of assault on or
near the Zuni reservation within the 12 months before the survey. An estimated
30% of the respondents indicated some type of domestic abuse within the past
12 months. 

Gender, age, and location of violent 
crime

Zuni Pueblo males were less likely than females to report being victims of an
assault. The majority of the reported violent victimizations were committed
against women. At all age levels, American Indian women of the Zuni Pueblo
made up a large number of victims of assault than men of the same age. Among
the age groups, most Zuni participants who reported being assaulted were
between ages 18 and 59. Nine in ten assaults occurred on the reservation. 

Alcohol related violent victimizations

For the Zuni reservation victims of assault, alcohol and drug use by the
offender was a factor in about 69% of the incidents. 

Respondents age 18 or older were asked about incidents of domestic violence in
the last 12 months.  Women of the Zuni Pueblo Indian Reservation were slightly
more likely than men to report domestic violence. 

Of those responding to the question, about 30% indicated they were the victims
of emotional, physical, and/or sexual abuse at the hands of someone they lived
with. More victims of domestic abuse reported being emotionally or
psychologically abused (44%) than physically abused (38%) by someone whom they
lived with during the past 12 months. 

Among the age groups, women respondents age 60 or older (29%)were nearly twice
as likely to be victims of domestic violence as men (16%) of the same age.
Alcohol or drug use by the offender was a factor for 3 in 5 of the incidents
of domestic violence reported on the Zuni reservation.

Sources of data on American 
Indians and crime
        
One of the challenges facing all Federal statistical agencies is that
representative statistical data about American Indians are difficult to
acquire and use. This is true for a number of reasons with respect to crime
data:

Sampling -- Most Federal surveys utilize nationally representative samples of
persons or households, thus limiting the capability to describe small
population subgroups in detail. (American Indians comprise under 1% of the
U.S. population.) In addition, sampling procedures, relying upon selection 
of respondents within clustered geographical sampling units, may by chance
miss those areas where concentrations of residences of small subgroups (such
as American Indians) may be located. Finally, frequent population movement
between tribal and nontribal areas for both Indians and non-Indians makes it
difficult to systematically describe those living in these areas.

The design of national surveys such as the NCVS does not permit calculating
separate statistics for each American Indian tribe.

Coverage of data -- Statistical coverage of incidents or cases in Indian
country utilizing law enforcement, judicial, or corrections data is difficult
to quantify because Federal, State, and local authorities may have overlapping
jurisdiction on tribal lands. Data about some crimes are collected by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in Indian country while other crimes by or
against American Indians are recorded by local sheriffs or police. Arrest 
data are profoundly limited by the lack of information on arrest coverage
among tribal and BIA law enforcement agencies. 

Census 2000 and American Indians
              
For the 2000 Census, respondents were able to report one or more races they
considered themselves and other household members to be. Because of these
changes, Census 2000 data on race are not directly comparable with data from
the 1990 Census or earlier. Caution should be used when interpreting changes
in the racial composition and or the computation of statistics using these
population estimates. Census data on race can be presented in three modes:
"race alone, race in combination, and the race alone and in combination." 
The violent crime rates presented in this report are based on the race alone
population data, where applicable. See the Census web site for additional
information <www.census.gov>.
               
National Crime Victimization Survey
                
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is one of two statistical
series maintained by the Department of Justice to learn about the extent to
which crime is occurring. The NCVS, which gathers data on criminal
victimization from a national sample of household respondents, provides 
annual estimates of crimes experienced by the public without regard to 
whether a law enforcement agency was called about the crime. Initiated in
1972, the NCVS was designed to complement what is known about crimes 
reported to local law enforcement agencies under the FBI's annual 
compilation known as the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR).

The NCVS gathers information about crime and its consequences from a
nationally representative sample of U.S. residents age 12 or older about any
crimes they may have experienced. For personal contact crimes the survey asks
about the perpetrator. Asking the victim about his/her relationship to the
offender is critical to determining whether the crime occurred between
intimates.

In the latter half of the 1980's, BJS, with the Committee on Law and Justice
of the American Statistical Association, sought to improve the NCVS components
to enhance the measurement of crimes including rape, sexual assault, and
intimate and family violence. The new questions and revised procedures were
phased in from January 1992 through June 1993 in half the sampled households.
Since July 1993 the redesigned methods have been used for the entire national
sample. 

One of the important contributions of the NCVS is that it permits multiple
years of responses to the same questions to be analyzed, facilitating research
on small subgroups of the population. For this study, 10 years of NCVS data
(1992-2001)were combined, resulting in more than 1.8 million interviews, just
over 13,000 of which were conducted among American Indians. This represents
the largest national sample of American Indians assembled for purposes of
better understanding the incidence and effects of criminal victimization.  

The estimate for the annual average number of observations estimate represents
the total number of victimizations reported during the 10 year data collection
(219.4 million) divided by 10. The annual average rate reports the number of
victimizations per 1,000 persons for the entire 10 year period.  The annual
average percent figure represents the November 19, 20045:42pmproportion of 
all victimizations recorded over the 10 years period with a specific
characteristic. For additional information see the NCVS BJS website
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict.htm>.

Uniform Crime Reporting program
 
The UCR program of the FBI provides another opportunity to examine the issue
of crime and violence among American Indians through the incident- based
Supplementary Homicide Report program and the summary compilation of national
arrest data published in the Crime in the United States series. The summary
based arrest component of the UCR provides data by race of arrests for both
Part I crimes and the less serious Part II crimes. 

American Indians are estimated to account for just under 1% of those arrested
for Part I violent crimes. Part II arrest offenses show that American Indians
comprise larger percentages of those arrested for DUI, vagrancy, liquor law
violations, and public drunkenness. Exact UCR coverage of arrests by tribal 
or BIA law enforcement agencies is not known, and the extent to which they
are included in the national estimates of arrests is not systematically
described.

Federal Justice Statistics Program
            
The Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP) provides annual data on
workload, activities, and case outcomes in the Federal criminal justice
system. Information is reported on all aspects of case processing in the
Federal justice system including the number of persons investigated,
prosecuted, convicted, incarcerated, sentenced to probation, released prior 
to trial, handled by magistrates, sentencing outcomes, and time served. Data
for this series are obtained from the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys,
the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and the Federal Bureau of
Prisons (BOP). Data are available by defendant race and ethnicity at each
processing stage of the Federal criminal justice system. The FJSP was
initiated in 1980. For additional information on the UCR see the FBI website
at the URL below <www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm#cius>.
  
The data describing offenders entering Federal prison come from the BJS
Federal Justice Statistics Program, using a database constructed by the 
BOP. The database provides information on all sentenced offenders admitted 
to or released from Federal prison during a fiscal year and on offenders in
prison at the end of each fiscal year. These data only include people in
federally-operated facilities. BOP operates 103 institutions and 28 
community corrections offices throughout the United States (BOP, About the
Federal Bureau of Prisons, 2001). 
         
Recidivism of Prisoners in 1994

This study of recidivism tracked 272,111 former inmates for 3 years after
their release in 1994. The 272,111 represents a weighted two-thirds of all
prisoners released in the United States that year. The study uses four
measures of recidivism: rearrest, reconviction, resentence to prison, and
return to prison with or without a new sentence. 

Three of the recidivism measures -- rearrest, reconviction, resentence to
prison -- are based exclusively on official criminal records kept in State 
and FBI criminal history repositories. One recidivism measure -- return to
prison with or without a new prison sentence -- is formed from a combination
of records from criminal history repositories plus prison records kept by
State departments of corrections. Persons selected for inclusion in the study
had to meet all four of these criteria:

*  A RAP sheet on the prisoner was found in the State criminal history
repository. 
*  The released prisoner was alive through the 3-year follow-up period.
*  The prisoner's sentence (or, as it is called in the database, the
"total maximum sentence length") was greater than 1 year(missing sentences
were treated as greater than 1 year).  
*  The prisoner's 1994 release was not recorded by the State department of
corrections as any of the following release to custody/detainer/warrant,
absent without leave, escape, transfer, administrative release, or release 
on appeal. See the BJS website <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/ rpr94.htm>.

Law Enforcement Management 
and Administrative Statistics
  
BJS maintains the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics
(LEMAS) series as the principal national source of data on the operations of
police and sheriff's departments nationwide. LEMAS compiles information every
3 to 4 years from all large law enforcement agencies (at least 100 sworn
personnel)and a sample of all other departments. 

To ensure an accurate sampling frame for its LEMAS survey, BJS periodically
sponsors a census of State and local law enforcement agencies. The 2000 
census included State and local agencies employing the equivalent of at 
least one full-time officer with general arrest powers. This report 
summarizes the findings of the census, which was co-sponsored by COPS. 
As in 1992 and 1996, the 2000 census collected data on the number of sworn 
and nonsworn personnel, including both full-time and part-time employees. 
Data were collected from agencies that employed at least one sworn officer 
or the part-time equivalent at the time of the census. The reference period
for all data is the pay period that included June 30, 2000. 

LEMAS data are obtained on the organization and administration of law
enforcement agencies, agency responsibilities, operating expenditures, job
functions, weapons policies, and demographic characteristics of sworn
personnel. BJS obtains similar information from campus law enforcement
agencies and Federal law enforcement agencies. LEMAS data are available on 
the race and ethnicity of law enforcement personnel since 1987. See
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/ abstract/csllea00.htm>.
              
Survey of Jails in Indian country           
The 2002 Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) includes all jails,
confinement facilities, and other detention centers located in Indian 
country and operated by tribal authorities or the Bureau of Indian Affairs
(BIA), U.S. Department of the Interior. BJS conducts the Survey of Jails in
Indian Country (SJIC) to describe all adult and juvenile jail facilities 
and detention centers in Indian country. For purposes of this report, 
Indian country includes reservations, pueblos, rancherias, and other
appropriate areas (18 U.S.C. sec 1151). The reference date for the most 
recent survey is June 28, 2002. The SJIC was initiated in 1998 as a component
of the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ). The ASJ is conducted in each of the years
between the Census of Jails. The November 19, 20045:42pm2002 ASJ consisted of
a sample survey of 826 local jail jurisdictions, a survey of the Nation's 50
multi-jurisdictional facilities, and a survey of the 70 facilities in Indian
country.

In 1998 the Office of Law Enforcement Services, provided a complete list of 
74 Indian country jail facilities. The list included detention centers, 
jails, and other correctional facilities, operated by tribal authorities or
the BIA. The facilities are in 19 States and are affiliated with 55 tribes.
Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires. Through follow-up phone calls 
and facsimiles, 68 of 70 facilities responded. See
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/ abstract/jic02.htm>.

National Prisoner Statistics program (NPS-8). 

Capital punishment information is collected annually as part of the National
Prisoner Statistics program (NPS-8). This data series is collected in two
parts: data on persons under sentence of death are obtained from the
department of corrections in each jurisdiction currently authorizing capital
punishment; and information on the status of death penalty statutes is
obtained from the Office of the Attorney General in each of the 50 States, 
the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government. Data collection forms
and more detailed tables are available on the BJS website
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cp02.htm> and in the Correctional Populations
in the United States -- Statistical Tables, also on the website. 

NPS-8 covers all persons under sentence of death at any time during the year
who were held in a State or Federal nonmilitary correctional facility.
Included are capital offenders transferred from prison to mental hospitals and
those who may have escaped from custody. Excluded are persons whose death
sentences have been overturned by the court, regardless of their current
incarceration status. 

The statistics reported in this report may differ from data collected
by other organizations for a variety of reasons: (1) NPS-8 adds
inmates to the population under sentence of death not at sentencing
but at the time they are admitted to a State or Federal correctional
facility; (2)If inmates entered prison under a death sentence or
were reported as being relieved of a death sentence in one year but
the court had acted in the previous year, the counts are adjusted to
reflect the dates of court decisions and (3) NPS counts are always
for the last day of the calendar year and will differ from counts for
more recent periods. See <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cp02.htm>.

Tribal Criminal History Improvement 
Pilot Program  

In 2004 BJS implemented the Tribal Criminal History Record Improvement Pilot
Program (T-CHRI) which will provide support to federally recognized tribes 
and State criminal records repositories to promote participation in and
improve the interface among tribal, State, and national criminal records
systems.  Criminal records are a chronological history describing offenders
and their contacts with the criminal justice system. Such records include
offender fingerprint identification and notations of arrest and subsequent
dispositions. Criminal records may also include records of protection orders,
sex offender registries, and other records of contacts with the justice
system. Criminal record systems depend on up-to-date automated fingerprint
identification systems to ensure that transactions are accurately identified
to the proper individual and to ensure linkage of records across
jurisdictions.

The goal of the T-CHRI Pilot grant program is to improve public safety in
Indian country by enhancing the quality, completeness, and accessibility of
criminal history record information and by ensuring the implementation of
criminal justice and non-criminal justice background check systems.
