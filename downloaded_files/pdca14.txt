Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003
*************************************

***************************************
PREA Data Collection Activities, 2014
***************************************

The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA; P.L. 108-79) requires the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to carry out, for each calendar year, a 
comprehensive statistical review and analysis of the incidence and effects of 
prison rape. The act further specifies that the review and analysis shall be 
based on a random sample, or other scientifically appropriate sample of not 
less than 10 percent of all prisons, and a representative sample of municipal 
prisons. 

In 2013, more than 7,600 prisons, jails, community-based facilities, and 
juvenile correctional facilities nationwide were covered by PREA. The act 
requires the Attorney General to submit­—no later than June 30 of each year—a 
report that lists institutions in the sample and ranks them according to the 
incidence of prison rape. BJS has developed a multiple-measure, multiple-mode 
data collection strategy to fully implement requirements under PREA.

***************************************
Data collections during 2013 and 2014
***************************************

The Survey of Sexual Violence (SSV) collects data annually from 
administrative records on the incidence of sexual victimization in adult and 
juvenile correctional facilities. The first of a series of data collections 
implemented to meet PREA mandates, this collection began in 2004. The survey 
includes measures of four different types of sexual victimization and is 
administered to a sample of at least 10% of all correctional facilities 
covered under PREA. It collects additional detail on the characteristics of 
substantiated incidents of sexual victimization.
The administrative records surveys provide a basis for the annual statistical 
review required under PREA. The surveys include all federal and state prison 
systems, as well as facilities operated by the U.S. Military and Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The surveys also include representative 
samples of jail jurisdictions, privately operated adult prisons and jails, 
and jails in Indian country. Each year, the SSV also includes all state-owned 
or -operated juvenile facilities and a representative sample of locally and 
privately operated juvenile facilities.

Results from the SSV for juvenile facilities are expected in September 2014.
 
BJS published two reports in January 2014: Sexual Victimization Reported by 
Adult Correctional Authorities, 2009–11 (NCJ 243904) and Survey of Sexual 
Violence in Adult Correctional Facilities, 2009–11 - Statistical Tables (NCJ 
244227). 

Among the findings--
*********************

* Administrators of adult correctional facilities reported 8,763 allegations 
of sexual victimization in 2011, a statistically significant increase over 
the 8,404 allegations reported in 2010 and 7,855 in 2009.

* The number of allegations has risen since 2005, largely due to increases in 
prisons, where allegations increased from 4,791 allegations to 6,660 in 2011 
(up 39%).

* In 2011, 902 allegations of sexual victimization (10%) were substantiated 
(i.e., determined to have occurred upon investigation).

* State prison administrators reported 537 substantiated incidents of sexual 
victimization in 2011, up 17% from 459 in 2005.

* About 52% of substantiated incidents of sexual victimization in 2011 
involved only inmates, while 48% of substantiated incidents involved staff 
with inmates.

* Injuries were reported in about 18% of incidents of inmate-on-inmate sexual 
victimization and in less than 1% of incidents of staff sexual 
victimizations.

* Females committed more than half of all substantiated incidents of staff 
sexual misconduct and a quarter of all incidents of staff sexual harassment.

During 2014, BJS modified the SSV and will implement changes for the 2013 
collection year. BJS will--

* revise the SSV definitions to synchronize the language with the PREA 
standards (while preserving the ability to measure long-term trends)

* add sexual harassment by another inmate as another category of sexual 
victimization (to be consistent with the PREA standards, 28 C.F.R. Part 115)
 
* add new response categories or expand existing categories to reduce 
responses reported in “other, specify”

* add transgender and intersex as gender categories (for sex of victim)

* expand the sample of local and privately operated juvenile facilities to 
improve precision of annual estimates. 
 
The National Survey of Youth in Custody (NSYC) provides facility-level 
estimates of youth reporting sexual victimization in juvenile facilities. The 
first NSYC (NSYC-1) was conducted between June 2008 and April 2009, and the 
second (NSYC-2) was conducted between February 2012 and September 2012. 

The NSYC-2 was conducted in 273 state-owned or -operated juvenile facilities 
and 53 locally or privately operated facilities that held adjudicated youth 
under state contract. The survey was completed by 8,707 adjudicated youth 
sampled from at least one facility in every state and the District of 
Columbia. 

BJS released the first report from NSYC-2 in June 2013: Sexual Victimization 
in Juvenile Facilities Reported by Youth, 2012 (NCJ 241708).


Among the findings--
*********************

* An estimated 9.5% of adjudicated youth in state juvenile facilities and 
state contract facilities (representing 1,720 youth nationwide) reported 
experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization by another youth 
or staff in the past 12 months or since admission, if less than 12 months.

* About 2.5% of youth (450 nationwide) reported an incident involving another 
youth, and 7.7% (1,390) reported an incident involving facility staff.

* Among the estimated 1,390 youth who reported victimization by staff, 89.1% 
were males reporting sexual activity with female staff, and 3.0% were males 
reporting sexual activity with both male and female staff. In comparison, 
males comprised 91% of adjudicated youth in the survey, and female staff 
accounted for 44% of staff in the sampled facilities.

* An estimated 3.5% of youth reported having sex or other sexual contact with 
facility staff as a result of force or other forms of coercion, while 4.7% of 
youth reported sexual contact with staff without any force, threat, or 
explicit form of coercion.

* About 20.3% of youth victims of staff sexual misconduct experienced 
physical force or threat of force, 12.3% were offered protection, and 21.5% 
were given drugs or alcohol to engage in sexual contact.

* When youth were asked who initiated sexual contact, 36.4% reported that the 
facility staff always made the first move, 17.4% reported that they always 
made the first move, and 46.3% said that sometimes the facility staff made 
the first move and sometimes they did.

* Among state-owned or -operated juvenile facilities only, the rate of sexual 
victimization declined from 12.6% in 2008–09 (when the first survey was 
conducted) to 9.9% in 2012. 

During 2014, BJS and Westat(the NSYC data collection agent) initiated further 
analyses of the NSYC-2 data to identify the key contextual and individual 
factors related to youth sexual victimization. Analyses of the NSYC-2 
Facility Survey examine the impact of facility and staff sizes, staff and 
youth composition, staff screening methods, and security measures. BJS will 
derive additional measures of facility-level characteristics from the youth 
self-reports. These measures include facility assault rates, fear of assault 
in the facility, attitudes of youth toward staff, gang activity in the 
facility, and the nature and extent of inappropriate staff behavior with 
youth. The second report will include a multilevel analysis of the 
relationships among facility and housing unit characteristics, youth-level 
risk factors, and self-reported sexual victimization.

The National Inmate Survey (NIS) gathers data on the prevalence and incidence 
of sexual assault in adult prison and local jail facilities, as reported by 
inmates. The inmates use audio computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) 
technology with a laptop touchscreen and an audio feed to maximize inmate 
confidentiality and minimize literacy issues. The first NIS (NIS-1) was 
conducted in 2007; the second (NIS-2), in 2008-09; and the third (NIS-3) in 
2011–12.

The NIS-3 was conducted in 233 state and federal prisons, 358 local jails, 
and 15 special confinement facilities operated by Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE), the U.S. Military, and correctional authorities in Indian 
country. A total of 92,449 inmates age 18 or older participated in the 
survey, including 38,251 prison inmates, 52,926 jail inmates, 573 ICE 
detainees, 539 inmates in military facilities, and 160 inmates in Indian 
country facilities. The survey was also administered to 527 juveniles ages 16 
to 17 held in state prisons and 1,211 juveniles ages 16 to 17 in local jails. 
The first report from NIS-3 was issued in May 2013: Sexual Victimization in 
Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2011–12 (NCJ 241399).
 
Among the findings--
*******************

* In 2011–12, an estimated 4.0% of state and federal prison inmates and 3.2% 
of jail inmates reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual 
victimization by another inmate or facility staff in the past 12 months or 
since admission to the facility, if less than 12 months.

* Using the same methodology since 2007, the change in rate of sexual 
victimization among state and federal prison inmates over the three surveys 
(4.5% in 2007, 4.4% in 2008–09, and 4.0% in 2011–12) was not statistically 
significant. Among jail inmates, the rate of sexual victimization was nearly 
unchanged—3.2% in 2007, 3.1% in 2008–09, and 3.2% in 2011–12.

* Among state and federal prison inmates, 2.0% (an estimated 29,300 
prisoners) reported an incident involving another inmate, 2.4% (34,100) 
reported an incident involving facility staff, and 0.4% (5,500) reported both 
an incident by another inmate and staff.

* About 1.6% (11,900) of jail inmates reported an incident with another 
inmate, 1.8% (13,200) reported an incident with staff, and 0.2% (2,400) 
reported both an incident by another inmate and staff.

* From 2007 to 2011–12, reports of “willing” sexual activity with staff 
(excluding touching) declined in prisons and jails, while reports of other 
types of sexual victimization remained stable.

* In 2011–12, an estimated 1.8% of juveniles ages 16 to 17 held in adult 
prisons and jails reported being victimized by another inmate, compared to 
2.0% of adults in prisons and 1.6% of adults in jails. 

* An estimated 3.2% of juveniles ages 16 to 17 held in adult prisons and 
jails reported experiencing staff sexual misconduct. Though higher, these 
rates were not statistically different from the 2.4% of adults in prisons and 
1.8% of adults in jails. 

BJS and RTI International (the NIS data collection agent) began further 
analyses of the NIS-3 data. Similar to the analyses of sexual victimization 
in juvenile facilities, this work is designed to explore facility-level 
predictors of inmate-on-inmate and staff-on-inmate sexual victimization. The 
analyses draw on facility-level data from past BJS prison facility censuses, 
the American Correctional Association’s annual facility directory, and 
information from the rosters provided by each facility sampled in the NIS-3 
collection. In addition, key facility composition and climate measures are 
derived from the NIS-3 inmate survey responses. BJS expects to issue a second 
report from NIS-3 that describes the contextual circumstances surrounding 
sexual victimization and provides a multilevel analysis of the relationships 
between facility- and individual-level characteristics and self-reported 
sexual victimization. 

In addition to providing a fuller understanding of sexual victimization in 
adult and juvenile correctional facilities, the ongoing contextual research 
is mandated under PREA, in Sec. 4c(3).  The act requires the Attorney General 
to--

**use established statistical methods to adjust the data as necessary to 
account for differences among institutions in the representative sample, 
which are not related to the detection, prevention, reduction and punishment 
of prison rape, or which are outside the control of the State, prison, or 
prison system, in order to provide an accurate comparison among prisons.  
Such differences may include the mission, security level, size, and 
jurisdiction under which the prison operates.

When completed in late 2014, the adult and juvenile facility reports will 
address the differences and examine facility- and individual-level variations 
after these differences have been statistically controlled.
