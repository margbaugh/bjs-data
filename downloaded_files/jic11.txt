A total of 2,239 inmates were confined in 80 Indian 
country jails at midyear 2011 (figure 1). The 5.7% 
increase from the 2,119 inmates confined in 75 operating 
facilities at midyear 2010 was the result of 5 additional 
facilities operating in 2011. During the 12-month period 
between June 2010 and 2011, the average number of inmates 
per operating facility remained stable at about 28 
inmates. On June 30, 2011, the number of American Indians 
and Alaska Natives confined in jails outside of Indian 
country (9,400) was about four times the number held in 
jails in Indian country.

*****************************************
The number of jails operating in Indian 
Country increased between 2004 and 2011
*****************************************

Through the Annual Survey of Jails in Indian Country 
(SJIC), the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collected 
data from correctional facilities between 2004 and 2011. 
The survey was not conducted in 2005 or 2006. The number 
of known operating facilities increased from 68 in 2004 
to 80 in 2011. Over the 7-year period, 11 facilities 
permanently closed and 21 facilities were newly 
constructed. Two facilities in 2011 (one adult and one 
juvenile) were treated as one respondent in 2010. A 
number of facilities were also determined to be out of 
scope of the survey, including four that were included in 
the 2009 survey, one in the 2010 survey, and three in the 
2011 survey. BJS estimated inmate population counts for 
seven facilities in 2004 and four facilities in 2007 that 
did not respond to the surveys. All known operating 
facilities responded to the 2008 through 2011 surveys. 
(See Methodology for information on jails in Indian 
country, including details on facility counts and 
participation in the surveys.)

HIGHLIGHTS
************

* Nationwide, 78,700 American Indians and Alaska Natives 
were under correctional supervision in the United States 
at midyear 2011.

* About 62% of these offenders (49,000) were under 
supervision in the community on probation or parole in 
2011, and 38% (29,700) were in prison or jail.

* At midyear 2011, a total of 2,239 inmates were confined 
in Indian country jails, a 5.7% increase from the 2,119 
inmates confined at midyear 2010.

* The number of inmates admitted into Indian country 
jails (12,784) during June 2011 was about 6 times the 
size of the average daily population (2,106).

* Fourteen jails held 52% of the total inmate population 
in Indian country at midyear 2011.

* For the 80 facilities operating in June 2011, the 
average expected length of stay upon admission for 
inmates was 5 days.

* About 3 in 10 inmates in Indian country jails were 
confined for a violent offense at midyear 2011, down from 
about 4 in 10 inmates in each year between midyear 2004 
and midyear 2009.

* Out of 74 responding jails, 8 in 10 Indian country 
jails  screened inmates for infectious diseases, 
including  tuberculosis (63 jails), hepatitis B (61 
jails), hepatitis C (61 jails), and HIV (58 jails).

*******************************************************

*****************************************
American Indians and Alaska Natives 
under correctional supervision
*****************************************

The number of American Indians and Alaska Natives on 
probation or parole or incarcerated in jail or prison 
reached an estimated 78,700 at midyear 2011, which was 
similar to the number (78,900) in 2010 (figure 2). Among 
American Indians under any form of correctional 
supervision in 2011, most (62% or 49,000) were supervised 
in the community on probation or parole (table 1). A 
total of 29,700 American Indians were in jail or prison 
at midyear 2011, accounting for 1.3% of all inmates in 
custody in jail or prison in the United States. Over half 
(14,600) of incarcerated American Indians were held in 
state prison, and about 12% were held in federal prison 
(3,500). The remaining 11,639 were confined in local 
jails (9,400) and Indian country jails (2,239). 

In 2011, American Indians and Alaska Natives in Indian 
country jails in  accounted for 7.5% of all American 
Indians and Alaska Natives confined in jail or prison 
nationwide. Some American Indians confined in local jails 
may have been adjudicated by a tribal criminal justice 
system and housed in jails under contracts with tribal, 
city, or county governments. Between midyear 2010 and 
2011, the number of American Indians under correctional 
supervision remained relatively stable, although slight 
declines occurred in the population of American Indians 
confined in local jails (down 5.1%) and state prisons 
(down 2.0%).

*******************************************************
Jurisdiction over crimes committed in 
Indian country
*****************************************

The local governing authority on Indian lands is 
typically a tribal government or council. Jurisdiction 
over crimes in Indian country depends on several factors, 
including the identity of the victim and the offender, 
the severity of the crime, and the location where the 
crime was committed. Tribal jurisdiction includes crimes 
committed by Indians in Indian country. Federal 
jurisdiction over crime in Indian country includes 14 
crimes under the Major Crimes Act of 1885 (18 U.S.C. & 
1153), and state jurisdiction includes all crimes on 
tribal lands specified under Public Law 280 (18 U.S.C. 7 
1162). 
 
Tribal rights to sentence offenders have been limited to 
1 year of imprisonment, a $5,000 fine, or both (25 U.S.C. 
& 1302(7)). On July 29, 2010, the Tribal Law and Order 
Act of 2010 (TLOA) was signed into law, expanding tribal 
court sentencing authority. As a result, offenders may 
serve potentially lengthier sentences (up to 3 years) in 
Indian country correctional facilities (Pub.L. 111-211, 
H.R. 725, 124 Stat. 2258).
*******************************************************

*****************************************
Percentage of occupied bed space on an 
average day in June remained stable
*****************************************

At midyear 2011, the jail facilities in Indian country 
were rated to hold 3,188 inmates, an overall rated 
capacity that increased by 187 beds from 3,001 in 2010 
(table 2). The change in capacity was mainly due to the 
increase from 75 operating facilities in 2010 to 80 in 
2011. Based on the 75 facilities that reported rated 
capacity in both 2010 and 2011, the amount of bed space 
remained the same in 55 facilities, increased by 64 beds 
in 11 facilities, and declined by 72 beds in 9 facilities 
(not shown in table).

When measured relative to the average daily population 
(ADP), the percentage of rated capacity occupied in 
Indian country jails remained stable in June 2010 (66.9%) 
and June 2011 (66.1%). This stability was the result of 
small changes in the ADP and the rated capacity in the 75 
facilities that provided data in both years.

When measured relative to the midyear inmate count, 
Indian country jails held a total of 2,239 inmates and 
were operating at 70% of rated capacity in 2011, 
remaining relatively stable since 2008. From June 2000 to 
June 2011, the overall rated capacity grew at a faster 
rate (up 54% from 2,076 in 2000 to 3,188 in 2011) than 
the midyear inmate population (up 26% from 1,775 to 
2,239).

*****************************************
Fourteen jails held more than half 
of all inmates
*****************************************

Fourteen jails held 52% of the total Indian country jail 
inmate population at midyear 2011 (table 3). Between 
midyear 2010 and midyear 2011, the population in the 13 
jails reporting data in both years increased by 81 
inmates (up 8%). Over the 12-month period, 5 of these 
facilities experienced an increase of 145 inmates in 
their populations and 8 facilities experienced a decrease 
of 64 inmates. One facility was not operating in 2010.

Among the 14 facilities holding the majority of inmates, 
the Oglala Sioux Tribal Offenders facility reported the 
largest increase (up 42 inmates or 78%) in the number of 
jail inmates from midyear 2010 to midyear 2011. The Gila 
River Department of Corrections and Supervision - Adult 
had the second largest increase in absolute numbers (up 
40 inmates). The Navajo Department of Corrections -Window 
Rock reported the largest percentage change (up 85% or 35 
inmates) between midyear 2010 (41 inmates) and midyear 
2011 (76 inmates).

The White Mountain Apache Detention Center (down 16 
inmates) and the Standing Rock Law Enforcement and Adult 
Detention Center (down 15 inmates) reported the largest 
decreases in the inmate population between midyear 2010 
and midyear 2011.
 
Based on the 75 facilities responding to the survey in 
both 2010 and 2011, the inmate population declined by 4 
inmates, from 2,086 inmates at midyear 2010 to 2,082 in 
2011 (not shown in table). Nearly 60% of the 75 jails 
experienced either a decrease (41 jails) or no change (3 
jails) in the size of their inmate populations over the 
12-month period ending midyear 2011. Overall, the 36% 
increase (280 inmates) in the jail population in 31 jails 
was offset by a 22% decrease (284 inmates) in 41 jails.

*****************************************
Jail population concentrated in facilities 
rated to hold 25 or more inmates
*****************************************

Of the inmates confined in the 80 Indian country jails at 
midyear 2011, about 84% (1,885) were held in 47 
facilities rated to hold 25 or more inmates 
(table 4). The 33 facilities with a rated capacity of 
fewer than 25 inmates accounted for about 41% of all 
facilities and held about 16% of all jail inmates in 
Indian country. The overall jail population ranged from a 
low of no inmates in 3 facilities to a high of 195 
inmates in the Tohono O’odham Adult Detention Center, 
which held nearly 9% of the total population in Indian 
country jails at midyear 2011.

*****************************************
Jails holding 50 or more inmates reported 
stability in their use of jail space 
in June 2011
*****************************************


The jails with a rated capacity of 50 or more inmates 
reported no change in use of their bed space in June 2011 
(figure 3). The percentage of capacity occupied in these 
jails was 64% at midyear 2011 and on an average day in 
June. On their most crowded day in June 2011, the 16 
largest jails were operating at 82% of their rated 
capacity. The 64 facilities rated to hold less than 50 
inmates reported less stability at midyear 2011 (77%), on 
an average day in June 2011 (68%), and on their most 
crowded day in June 2011 (123%). 

About 44% (35 facilities) of the 80 facilities in 2011 
were operating above rated capacity on the most crowded 
day in June, up from about 39% of the jails in 2010 
(table 5). Of those 35 facilities, 17 were operating 
above rated capacity on June 30, and 15 were operating 
above rated capacity on an average day in June 2011.

*****************************************
Sixteen jails were operating at more than 
50% over capacity on their most crowded 
day in June 2011
*****************************************

Sixteen jails in Indian country reported operating at 
more than 50% over rated capacity on the facility’s most 
crowded day in June 2011, up from 15 facilities during 
June 2010 (table 6). Ten of these jails were rated to 
hold 25 or more inmates, and 6 were rated to hold fewer 
than 25 inmates. The San Carlos Department of Corrections 
and Rehabilitation-Adult (rated capacity of 108) and 
Tohono O’odham Adult Detention Center (rated capacity of 
107) were the largest of these jails and operated at 66% 
and 87%, respectively, over capacity on their peak day in 
June 2011.

Among the 16 facilities operating at more than 50% over 
rated capacity on their most crowded day in June 2011, 
six were also operating at more than 50% over capacity at 
midyear 2011 and four on an average day in June 2011. 
Four facilities—White Mountain Apache Detention Center 
(rated capacity based on 2010), Northern Cheyenne Adult 
Detention Center, Fort Belknap Adult Detention Center, 
and the Tohono O’odham Adult Detention Center—were 
operating at more than 50% over capacity on all three 
measures (midyear, most crowed day, and the average day 
in June 2011).

*****************************************
Jail admissions declined in most 
Indian country jails
*****************************************

During 2011, the 80 Indian country jails admitted 12,784 
persons, up from the 12,545 persons admitted to the 75 
operating facilities in June 2010 (table 7). The slight 
increase in admissions was the result of 5 additional 
facilities operating in June 2011. In 2011, admissions to 
facilities rated to hold between 25 and 49 inmates 
accounted for about half (6,299) of all admissions. The 
remaining jail admissions were measured in facilities 
rated to hold 10 to 24 inmates (27%), 50 or more inmates 
(22%), and small facilities rated to hold less than 10 
inmates (2%) in June 2011.

Despite an overall increase in Indian country jail 
admissions, the 73 facilities that provided data in both 
years reported an 8% decline, from 12,112 admissions in 
June 2010 to 11,169 in June 2011 (table 8). Nearly half 
of the decline came from the largest facilities rated to 
hold 50 or more inmates (down 21%). Consistent with the 
sharp decline in admissions and increase in ADP in these 
facilities, the average expected length of stay (the time 
held in custody from admission to release) increased from 
nearly 13 days in June 2010 to about 18 days in June 
2011. The expected length of stay in all other categories 
remained relatively stable.

*****************************************
A third of inmates were held for 
a violent offense 
*****************************************

While the number of inmates confined in Indian country 
jails increased between 2004 and 2011, the distribution 
of inmates by sex and age remained relatively stable 
(table 9). Adult males accounted for the largest portion 
of the inmate population in Indian country jails 
throughout the decade, as nearly 8 in 10 inmates were 
male. The female jail population had small increases 
through midyear 2010 and annually accounted for about 20% 
of the jail population. 

The distribution of inmates by conviction status and 
offense type experienced some change at midyear 2011. 
After the percentage of convicted inmates peaked in 2009 
at 69%, it declined in 2011 to 57%. About 30% of inmates 
in Indian country jails were confined for a violent 
offense, including domestic violence, assault, rape or 
sexual assault, and other violence at midyear 2010 and 
2011. This was down from about 4 in 10 inmates in each 
year between midyear 2004 and midyear 2009.
 
Between midyear 2010 and 2011, while increases were seen 
in inmates charged with simple or aggravated assault, 
small declines were reported in the number of inmates 
held for other violent offenses (domestic violence, rape 
or sexual assault, and unspecified violent offenses). At 
midyear 2011, domestic violence (12%) and simple or 
aggravated assault (12%) accounted for the largest 
percentage of violent offenders. Inmates held for 
unspecified violence (4%) and rape or sexual assault (2%) 
accounted for about 6% of the jail population.

Forty-eight facilities held at least one inmate for 
domestic violence. Seven facilities accounted for over 
half of the inmates held for domestic violence, and 17 
facilities held 76% of all inmates confined for domestic 
violence. Similar patterns were observed among facilities 
holding inmates for simple or aggravated assault. Nine 
facilities held around half and 21 held three-quarters of 
the inmates confined for simple or aggravated assault. In 
total, 51 facilities (60% of all facilities) held at 
least one inmate for simple or aggravated assault.

*****************************************
Continued increase in correctional staff 
*****************************************

The 78 Indian country jails that reported information on 
staff employed 1,607 persons at midyear 2011 (table 10). 
About 73% (1,180) of these personnel were jail operations 
staff, including correctional officers and other staff 
who spent more than 50% of their time supervising 
inmates. This was up from 69% of all staff during the 
same period in 2010. Based on the 75 facilities that 
reported on staffing in both 2010 and 2011, the number of 
jail operations staff increased nearly 9% (87 persons) 
(not shown in a table). Overall, the ratio of inmates to 
jail operations employees was 1.8 inmates to 1 jail 
operations employee at midyear 2011, down from 2.1 to 1 
in 2010, and 2.5 to 1 in 2004.

The remaining 427 jail personnel in 2011 in these 78 
Indian country jails included administrative employees, 
educational staff, technical or professional staff, 
clerical, maintenance or food service staff, and staff 
performing other job functions. 

*****************************************
Attempted suicides in Indian country 
jails declined since 2002
*****************************************

Indian country jail authorities reported 1 death in 
custody during the 12-month period ending June 30, 2011. 
Two deaths were reported during the 12-month period 
ending June 30, 2010, no deaths were reported during 12-
month period ending June 30, 2009, and 4 deaths were 
reported during the 12-month period ending June 30, 2008 
(not shown in a table). 

During the 12-month period ending June 30, 2011, 76 
facilities reported a combined 33 attempted suicides. The 
number of attempted suicides by inmates increased from 20 
in 2010 to 31 in 2011, based on 69 facilities reporting 
valid data on attempted suicide in both years.

Since 2002 when attempted suicides peaked, the number of 
attempted suicides declined by nearly 90%. Based on 
facilities reporting in both years, the number of 
attempted suicides declined from 215 in 2002 to 28 in 
2011.***FOOTNOTE *The number of attempted suicides may 
differ from previous published counts, see Methodology 
for details.***

*****************************************
Nearly all Indian country jails provided 
medical and mental health services 
to inmates
*****************************************

An addendum to the 2011 Annual Survey of Jails in Indian 
Country obtained in-depth data on inmate health services 
and facility programs. For the second time since 2004, 
information was collected on HIV, hepatitis B and C, and 
tuberculosis. Other questions in the addendum asked about 
inmate medical services, mental health services, suicide 
prevention procedures, substance dependency programs, 
domestic violence counseling, sex offender treatment, 
educational programs, and inmate work assignments. 
Seventy-five of the 80 facilities surveyed responded to 
at least a portion of the addendum, covering 90% (2,023) 
of the 2,239 inmates held at midyear 2011.

All facilities (75) responding to the addendum provided 
inmates with some form of medical service on or off 
facility grounds (table 11). Out of 73 facilities 
responding to questions on mental health services 
provided to inmates, 68 provided some form of service 
including screening at intake, psychiatric evaluation, 
24-hour care, psychotropic medication, routine therapy or 
counseling, and community mental health referral 
services.

Out of 74 responding facilities, 71 reported following at 
least one suicide prevention procedure, with 69 assessing 
inmates at intake for risk of suicide and 68 maintaining 
specific cells or locations for inmates at risk. Other 
suicide prevention procedures included monitoring and 
providing special inmate counseling for high-risk 
offenders and training staff in risk assessment and 
suicide prevention.

Eight in 10 of the 74 responding Indian country jails 
screened inmates for infectious diseases, including 
tuberculosis (63 jails), hepatitis B (61 jails), 
hepatitis C (61 jails), and HIV (58 jails). Possible 
testing procedures included screening inmates at 
admission to jail, at regular intervals while inmates 
were confined, at random, upon request, after inmates 
were exposed to the active disease or involved in an 
incident, upon clinical indication of need, and at 
release from jail.

****************************************
Alcohol and drug dependency programs 
were available to inmates in about
70% of Indian country jails
*****************************************

At midyear 2011, between 68 and 75 facilities reported on 
the availability of treatment, counseling, and special 
programs for inmates confined in Indian country jails. 
These programs included—

Treatment and counseling programs
----------------------------------

* Alcohol dependency counseling or awareness programs 
were available on or off the facility grounds in 62 
facilities (table 12).

* Counseling programs to address drug dependency were 
available on or off the facility grounds in 59 Indian 
country jails.

* Sex offender treatment was available in 8 facilities.

* Domestic violence counseling was available in 40 
facilities.

* Life skills and religious/spiritual counseling programs


*****************************************
Life skills and community adjustment 
training, including personal finance
and conflict resolution programs, 
were available in 25 facilities.
*****************************************

* Parenting and child rearing skill classes were 
available in 35 facilities.

* Religious and spiritual counseling programs were 
available on or off the facility grounds in 56 
facilities.

*****************************************
Employment and educational programs
*****************************************

* Seventeen facilities offered vocational training and 
classes in job seeking and interviewing skills.

* Nearly half of the facilities (36) offered a GED 
program to inmates.

* Accredited education programs for inmates that included 
basic and high school classes were available to inmates 
in 31 facilities.

* Tutors and special education needs programs for inmates 
with learning disabilities were each available 17 
facilities in 2011.

* Thirteen facilities (18%) offered college-level classes 
to inmates.

*****************************************
Nearly 70% of facilities in Indian 
country provided work assignments for 
inmates in 2011
*****************************************

Out of 74 responding facilities, 51 offered inmates 
assignments in office and administrative work, food 
service, facility cleaning, building maintenance, and 
public work assignments outside facility grounds (not 
shown in a table). Public work assignments, such as road, 
park, or other public maintenance, were available to 
inmates in 28 facilities. About 9% of the facilities (7) 
offered inmates farming or agricultural work assignments. 
Three facilities offered inmates work assignments in 
correctional industries, which included working with wood 
products, textiles, and manufacturing services.

*****************
Methodology 
*****************

The Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) Annual Survey of 
Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) includes all known Indian 
country correctional facilities operated by tribal 
authorities or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. 
Department of the Interior. The survey was conducted in 
June 2011 and included the number of inmates and percent 
of capacity occupied based on the average daily 
population (ADP), midyear population, and peak population 
in facilities in June 2011 (appendix table 1). The 
midyear count is the number of inmates held on the last 
weekday in June, ADP is the number of inmates confined 
each day in June divided by 30, and the peak population 
is the number of inmates held on the day in June in which 
the custody population of a facility was the largest. 

Also in 2011, the survey included an addendum that 
collected in-depth data on inmate health services and 
facility programs (appendix tables 5-14). Seventy-five 
out of 80 facilities responded to at least a portion of 
the addendum.

Through a cooperative agreement with BJS, Westat, Inc. 
conducted the SJIC to describe all adult and juvenile 
jail facilities and detention centers in Indian country. 
For this report, Indian country includes reservations, 
pueblos, rancherias, and other appropriate areas (18 
U.S.C. & 1151). The reference date for the survey is June 
30, 2011. 

Indian country is a statutory term that includes all 
lands within an Indian reservation, dependent Indian 
communities, and Indian trust allotments (18 U.S.C. & 
1151). Courts interpret Section 1151 to include all lands 
held in trust for tribes or their members. (See United 
States v. Roberts, 185 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 1999).) 
Tribal authority to imprison American Indian offenders 
had been limited to one year per offense by statute (25 
U.S.C. & 1302), a $5,000 fine, or both. On July 29, 2010, 
the Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 (TLOA) was signed 
into law, expanding tribal court sentencing authority. As 
a result, offenders may serve potentially lengthier 
sentences (up to 3 years) in Indian country correctional 
facilities (Pub.L. 111-211, H.R. 725, 124 Stat. 2258). 

Tribal law enforcement agencies act as first responders 
to both felony and misdemeanor crimes. For most of Indian 
country, the federal government provides felony law 
enforcement concerning crimes by or against Indians. 
Certain areas of Indian country are under Public Law 83-
280, as amended. Public Law  280 conferred jurisdiction 
over Indian country to certain states and suspended 
enforcement of the Major Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. & 1153) 
and the General Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. & 1152) in those 
areas. Indian tribes retain concurrent jurisdiction to 
enforce laws in Indian country where P.L. 280 applies. 

Annually, BIA provides BJS a list of Indian country jail 
facilities, including detention centers, jails, and other 
correctional facilities operated by tribal authorities or 
BIA. BJS uses this list to update its existing roster of 
jails in Indian country. BJS obtains data from 
administrators of Indian country jails by faxed 
questionnaires and through follow-up phone calls and 
facsimiles. 

In 2004, BJS contacted administrators in 70 facilities to 
participate in the survey. BJS received responses from 61 
facilities. Seven facilities did not respond, and two 
facilities were not operating. In 2007, BJS’s roster 
consisted of 86 facilities. Seventy-nine of the facility 
administrators responded to the survey, four did not 
respond, and three facilities were not operating. In 
2008, BJS’s roster of Indian country jails consisted of 
85 facilities. BJS received responses from 82 facility 
administrators. There were no nonrespondents, and three 
facilities were not operating. For 2009, BJS’s roster 
consisted of 86 facilities. BJS received responses from 
80 facility administrators. There were no nonrespondents 
and six facilities not operating. Prior to the 2010 data 
collection, one facility in the 2009 universe was 
determined to be closed, resulting in a revised (79 
facilities) facility count. 

For 2010, BJS’s roster consisted of 86 facilities. Prior 
to the survey collection, seven facilities were closed, 
not operating, or out of scope, resulting in a survey 
universe of 79 facilities. During the survey collection, 
BJS determined that four facilities were holding cells 
and were out of scope, resulting in a final universe of 
75 Indian country jails. BJS received responses from all 
75 facility administrators. For comparison over time, BJS 
estimated data on inmate populations for the seven 
facilities in 2004 and four facilities in 2009 that did 
not respond to the surveys. 

For 2011, BJS’s roster consisted of 88 facilities. Prior 
to the survey collection, six facilities were closed, not 
operating, or out of scope, resulting in a survey 
universe of 82 facilities. During the survey collection, 
BJS determined that three additional facilities were 
holding cells and were out of scope, and one facility was 
added to the list, resulting in a final universe of 80 
Indian country jails. BJS received responses from all 80 
facility administrators.

Attempted suicides 2002 and 2011
*****************************************

When analyzing data on attempted suicides, an analysis of 
the number of facilities reporting in both years is 
necessary to draw a meaningful comparison. For 2002, data 
on attempted suicides (282) were reported from 64 of the 
70 facilities in operation.  For 2011, data on attempted 
suicides (33) were reported from 76 of the 80 facilities 
in operation. Over this period, a number of facilities 
were closed, newly constructed, and built to house 
juvenile only inmates. Facilities reporting attempted 
suicides in both years (58) included 52 matching 
facilities and an additional 6 tribes that operated 6 
juvenile-only facilities in 2011 that that were not in 
operation in 2002; however, those 6 tribes previously 
included 6 facilities that held both adult and juvenile 
inmates in 2002. Six facilities did not response in 2002 
or did not respond in 2011. Twelve facilities in 2002 
were closed in 2011 and 15 facilities in 2011 were not in 
operation in 2002.

Expected length of stay
*************************
 
The stock-flow ratio method was used to measure the 
expected average length of stay for inmates held during 
June 2011 in the 80. Data were estimated for two 
facilities in 2011 that did not report their ADP and 
admissions.

Stock--average daily population = 2,106 

Flow--inmate admissions during June 2011 = 12,784
 
Stock-flow ratio in June 2011 = 0.165
(2,106/12,784 = 0.165) 

Expected length of stay in days (the average number of 
days held in custody from admission to release) = 4.9 
days (0.165 x 30 days = 4.9)
