* During 1996 over 15,000 tort, contract, and real property
cases were disposed of by trial verdict in the Nation's 75
largest counties.  About 70% of these cases were decided by
a jury.

* Two-thirds of disposed trial cases involved tort claims
and about one-third involved contractual issues.  Tort cases
(85%) were more likely than contract cases (36%) to be disposed
of by jury trial.

* Individuals were plaintiffs in 82% of all trial cases disposed
of during 1996.  Individuals sued businesses in 37% and other
individuals in an additional 34% of all trial cases and other
individuals with an additional 34%.

* Overall, plaintiffs won in 52% of trial cases.  Plaintiffs won
in bench cases (62%) more than in jury cases (49%), and in contract
cases (62%) more than in either tort (48%) or real property
cases (32%).

* An estimated $3 billion in compensatory and punitive damages 
were awarded to plaintiff winners in trial cases.  Juries awarded 
an estimated total of $2.4 billion to plaintiff winners and judges
$629 million.  The median total award for plaintiff winners in
jury cases was $35,000 and in bench cases, $28,000.

* Punitive damages, estimated at $637 million, were awarded to
4% of plaintiff winners in trial cases, with a median of
$40,000.  Juries awarded over $545 million in 212 plaintiff
winners cases and judges over $91 million in 136 plaintiff
winner cases.

* About 70% of bench cases and 56% of jury cases were disposed
of in less than 2 years.  The median processing time from 
filing to final verdict or  judgment  was 22.1 months for jury 
cases and 17.8 months for bench cases.
------------------------------------------------------------------

State courts of general jurisdiction in the Nation's 75 largest
counties disposed of by trial over 15,000 tort, contract and
real property rights cases between January and December 1996. 
About 70% of the trial cases were decided by a jury and 30% 
by a judge.

Tort claims comprised 66% of the trial cases disposed. 
Plaintiffs won in 52% of trial cases and were awarded $3 
billion in compensatory and punitive damages.  The median 
total award was $33,000.  The majority of trial cases (60%) 
were disposed of in less than 2 years.

These are some of the findings from a study of civil trial 
cases in State courts involving tort, contract, and real property
cases in the Nation's 75 largest counties.  This study expands
the 1992 civil jury trial study (Civil Jury Cases and
Verdicts in Large Counties, NCJ 154346) by specifically sampling
bench and jury trial cases.  The sample of civil trial cases
excluded civil cases outside tort, contract and real property
cases, Federal trials, trials in counties outside the 75
largest, and trials in State courts of limited jurisdiction.

Cases that reach trial

During calendar year 1996, State courts of general jurisdiction
in the Nation's 75 largest counties disposed of an estimated
15,600 tort, contract, and real property rights trial cases.
Previous studies conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
found that a majority of tort, contract, and real property cases
are resolved prior to going to trial and only a small percentage
are actually disposed of by jury or bench trial verdict. (See
Tort Cases in Large Counties, NCJ 153177, and Contract Cases in
Large Counties, NCJ 156664).

Two-thirds (66%) of civil trial cases disposed of in the
Nation's 75 largest counties during 1996 involved a tort claim,
in which plaintiffs alleged injury, loss, or damage from
negligent or intentional acts of defendants. Cases dealing with
allegations of breach of contract (contract cases) accounted for
31% of trial cases, and claims dealing with the ownership of
real property (real property rights cases) about 3% (table 1).

--------------------------------------------------------- 

The most frequent kinds of civil cases disposed by trial
verdict were automobile accident cases (32%) and premises
liability cases (14%) allege harm from inadequately 
maintained or dangerous property.(Footnote: The term verdict 
is used throughout the report to refer to jury verdicts and 
judgments entered by a judge.) Of all civil cases 
disposed by trial verdict, seller plaintiff cases accounted 
for 11%, medical malpractice cases 8%, and product liability  
about 3%.

While most civil trial cases involved a single type of 
claim, about 8% of all trial cases had a second civil claim 
associated with it. 


Types of cases disposed by trial

Overall, about 68% of all trial cases were decided by a jury
(figure 1).   Tort cases (85%) were more likely than contract
cases (36%) or real property cases (21%) to be decided by jury
trial.  The majority of contract (61%) and real property cases
(78%) were disposed of by bench trial.

Note: Data were missing for type of case in 127 cases and for 
type of trial in 23 cases.  Not shown are cases disposed of 
by directed verdict, judgment notwithstanding, and jury verdicts
for defaulted defendants.  These cases make up 3% of all cases,
2% of tort cases, 3% of contract cases, and 1% of real property
cases.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Nine out of ten medical malpractice and asbestos product
liability cases disposed of by trial were decided by a jury (not
shown in a table).  All seven breast implant product liability
cases and the vast majority of automobile tort cases were 
disposed of by jury trial. Among contract cases, two-thirds of 
employment discrimination suits were decided by a jury.

Bench trials disposed of 77% of seller plaintiff cases, 72% of
rental lease cases and 53% of fraud cases (not shown in a table). 
Three-fourths of real property rights cases disposed of by trial 
also were decided by a judge.  Buyer plaintiff and tortious 
interference cases were evenly disposed of by jury (48%) and 
bench trials (48%). (Footnote: Tortious interference cases 
are tort claims arising out of contractual disputes.  In 
this report, tortious interferference cases are classified as 
contract cases.)

Type of litigants:  Plaintiffs

In 82% of all trial cases, the plaintiff was an individual.
(Footnote:  Each civil trial case, regardless of the number
of plaintiff types involved, was given one of four
plaintiff designations from the following hierarchy:
hospital, business, government, and individual. 
A case with multiple plaintiffs was assigned the
plaintiff type which appeared first in the hierarchy.) 
Businesses were plaintiffs in 16% of all trial cases, 
government agencies, 2%, and hospitals, 0.4% (table 2).

99.6% of bench trial cases,  and all other trial cases eith a known case type.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

In 91% of jury trials, the plaintiff was an individual compared 
to 59% of bench trials.  About a third of bench trials 
had a business as the plaintiff.

Because tort litigation primarily involves personal injury, over
95% of tort trial cases had an individual as the plaintiff
(table 3).

In 55% of all contract trial cases, the plaintiff was
an individual. Among specific types of contract cases, the type
of plaintiff varied.  In over half of seller plaintiff cases
(66%), mortgage foreclosure cases (58%), tortious interference
cases (55%), and rental/lease cases (51%), the plaintiff was a
business.  In 4% of other employment disputes, the plaintiff was
a government agency.  Two percent of seller plaintiff and other
contract cases had a hospital as the plaintiff.


Type of litigants:  Defendants

Defendants in trial cases were primarily divided between businesses 
(48%)and individuals (40%). (Footnote: A case with multiple defendants 
was assigned the defendant type which appeared first
in the hierarchy.)

Of all trial cases, governmental agencies were named as a defendant 
in 7%, and hospitals in 6% (table 2). In jury trial cases, 45% of 
the defendants were businesses and 41% were individuals.  Businesses 
(54%) were more likely than individuals (39%) to be named as 
defendants in bench trial cases.


In tort trial cases, 43% of defendants were individuals, and
another 42% were businesses.  Individuals (63%) were more likely
than businesses (31%) to be named as defendants in automobile trial cases.  
In asbestos (100%) and other product liability (97%) cases, virtually all 
defendants were businesses (table 3).


About 63% of defendants in contract trial cases were
businesses.  In buyer plaintiff cases, 82% of the defendants
were businesses and in tortious interference cases, 74% of
defendants were businesses.


In 25% of employment discrimination cases and 13% of intentional
tort cases decided by trial, the defendant was a governmental
agency.  Hospitals were named as defendants in 56% of medical
malpractice cases.



Who sues whom?  

Individuals sued businesses in 37% of all trial cases and other
individuals in an additional 34% of trial cases (table 4).

In 9% of trial cases a non-individual sued a business.  The most
common type of jury trial case involved an individual suing a
business (39%)or another individual (38%).  

Bench trial cases were divided among an individual suing a
business (29%), an individual suing another individual (25%), and
a non-individual suing a business (22%).  In another 12% of
bench trials, a non-individual sued an individual.



Multiple plaintiffs and defendants

In 1996 tort, contract and real property trial cases disposed
of in State general jurisdiction courts in the Nation's 75
largest counties involved over 56,000 litigants.  The median
number of litigants per case was 3; the average was 4.

Trial cases with multiple defendants were more prevalent than
than those with multiple plaintiffs.  About three-fourths of all 
trial cases disposed of had one plaintiff, and half had one
defendant.  Half of asbestos product liability cases had 18 or 
more defendants per case.  The seven breast implant product
liability trial cases had an average of 8 defendants (not shown
in a table).

Trial verdicts

Overall, plaintiffs won in 52% of trial cases.  Plaintiff
success varied by type of trial and type of case.  Plaintiffs
were more likely to win in bench trial cases (62%) than jury
trial cases (49%). They were also more likely to win in contract 
cases (62%) more than in either tort (48%) or real property 
(32%)cases (table 5).

Trial awards

During 1996 plaintiff winners in civil trials were awarded an
estimated total of $3 billion in compensatory and punitive
damages in the Nation's 75 largest counties.  Nearly two thirds
of this total amount (just over $2 billion) was awarded in tort
cases alone.  The median amount awarded to plaintiff winners for
all trial cases was $33,000.  About 16% of plaintiff winners
were awarded over $250,000 in total damages while an estimated
6% were awarded $1 million or more (table 6).

--No cases recorded.
*Not a median but the actual amount awarded.
a/Eminent domain cases are not calculated among final awards because there is always
an award; the issue is how much the defendant (whose property is being condemned) will receive
for the property.
b/The number of trial cases includes jury and bench cases, cases with a directed verdict, those
with a judgment not withstanding the verdict and those with a jury trial for defaulted defendants.
c/In one jury trial case, the plaintiff winner(s) was awarded over $40 billion.  This cases was
excluded from the above analysis
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
 
 
Compensatory damages include all financial losses that are the
result of the defendant's conduct.  In tort and contract cases,
this refers typically to economic losses for which trial winners
receive compensation (sometimes called "special" damages).  In
tort cases, however, compensatory damages refer also to
noneconomic losses, such as pain, suffering, and emotional
distress (sometimes called "general" damages).  Economic and
noneconomic compensatory damages cannot be distinguished in the
data for detailed analysis.  

Included also in the total award amount are punitive damages.  
Awards for punitive damages are almost exclusively reserved 
for tort claims in which the defendant's conduct was grossly 
negligent or intentional.

Looking at particular types of cases, plaintiff winners in medical 
malpractice cases received a median award of $286,000, with 1 in 5 
receiving awards of $1 million or more.  In contract cases involving
employment discrimination, the median award was $200,000.  In
tort cases involving automobiles, the most common type of
civil trial, median award among plaintiff winners was $18,000.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Defendant winners of compensatory and punitive damage awards
 
In cases with claims and counterclaims, the distinction between
plaintiff and defendant becomes less clear.  Therefore, it is 
possible that one party originally named as a defendant 
countersues the plaintiff and actually wins damages.  In 1996 
the defendant won damages on a countersuit in about 2% of tort, 
contract, and real property rights cases (excluding eminent 
domain cases) disposed of by trial verdict in the Nation's 
largest 75 counties.
 
Defendants in tort, contract, and real property cases (excluding 
eminent domain cases) won an estimated $91 million in compensatory 
and punitive damages on counterclaims.  The median award amount 
was $17,000. Fifty-four percent of the defendant winner cases 
were decided by bench trial, 44% by jury trial, and 2% by dir-
ected verdict.  Of trial cases won by defendants, 17% involved 
a counterclaim associated with a buyer plaintiff case, 16% with 
a seller plaintiff or auto tort case, and 14% with a rental/lease case.
 
Punitive damages were awarded to 21 defendant winners in trial cases,
totaling almost $3 million.  Half of defendants receiving punitive 
damages were awarded $20,000 or more. Among the 21 defendant 
winners receiving punitive damages, 18 were awarded by jury trial 
including 3 after a judge's directed verdict and 3 by bench trial. 
The largest punitive damage amount was $750,000 to three defendants
who countersued in a buyer plaintiff case.
----------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------
Largest damage award reversed on appeal
 
During 1996 the largest amount of damages awarded to a plaintiff
winner among the sampled cases in the 45 counties involved a case 
with Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos as defendants. In this tort claim 
Rogelia Roxas alleged that the Marcoses had confiscated crates 
of gold bullion allegedly found by Roxas.
 
A jury in Honolulu awarded $22 billion in compensatory damages that 
after the jury verdict had increased with interest to over $40 billion.  
The jury did not award punitive damages. 

The case took nearly 8 1/2 years to process from the time it was filed
in March 1988 to its jury verdict in July 1996.  The actual jury trial
lasted 15 days.
 
On November 17, 1998, the Hawaii Supreme Court reversed a $41 billion
judgment against the Marcoses.  The court found insufficient evidence 
that Roxas had actually discovered the gold bullion while treasure hunting 
north of Manila in 1971.

P. 2d. 1209 (1998).
----------------------------------------------------------------


The data reveal that final award amounts also varied by whether
the case was decided by a jury or a judge.  This is particularly
true for contract cases in which juries awarded a median amount 
of $80,000 compared to the $25,000 median amount awarded by judges 
(table 7).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
 
Among contract cases, juries awarded plaintiff winners in fraud cases a
median of $79,000 while judges awarded a median of $32,000.  In seller
plaintiff cases, a median of $62,000 was awarded by juries compared to
$26,000 by judges (table 7).

Among tort cases juries awarded significantly more than judges in
other product liability and other negligence cases.

In several types of cases, juries more often than judges awarded
damages of $1 million or more.  Juries awarded $1 million or more
for damages in 22% of medical malpractice cases and 14% of
employment discrimination cases.  By contrast, in neither of
these types of cases did judges award total damages of $1
million or more.


Punitive damage awards

Of the 7,892 trial cases in which the plaintiff won, about 5%
(360 cases) received punitive damages as part of the final award, 
totaling over $600 million and accounting for about 21% of the
$3 billion awarded to plaintiffs overall. 

The median punitive damage amount awarded to plaintiff winners
was $40,000.  Twenty-one percent of punitive damage awards
were over $250,000, and 7% were $1 million or more (table 8).

Plaintiffs won punitive damage awards in 11% of contract cases compared to
4% of tort cases (not shown in a table).

In 1996 judges awarded over $91 million in punitive damages in
136 cases disposed of in the Nation's 75 largest counties (not
shown in table).  The median amount awarded was $38,000 and 6%
of the punitive damage awards were $1 million or more.  Among
bench trials, plaintiff winners were more likely to win punitive
damage awards in tort cases (8%) than contract cases (4%)
(not shown in a table).  The median award for tort cases awarded
punitive damages by judges was $75,000 and for contract cases
was $30,000.

The largest punitive damage award
 
The largest punitive damage award to plaintiff winners in the 45
sampled counties was $138 million awarded by a jury in Harris County,
Texas. It was a negligence case involving 22 plaintiffs and 6 defendants.
The jury also awarded $5.4 million in compensatory damages.  The case
took over 3.5 years to process from the filing of the complaint to the 
final disposition. The actual trial lasted 21 days.

Compensatory versus punitive damage awards

In about a third of civil trial cases in which punitive damages were
awarded to the plaintiff winner, the amount of punitive damages
exceeded the amount awarded for compensatory damages (table 10).

Federal district courts than State courts. The median award for plaintiff
winners was $130,000 for all Federal tort, contract, and real prop-
erty rights cases disposed of by trial. The median award was $150,000
for jury trials and $103,000 for bench trials.

The role of contributory negligence
 
In 10% of the tort, contract, and real property rights cases in 
which a jury or judge awarded compensatory damages to the plaintiff, 
the damages were reduced because the plaintiff had contributed 
to the negligence that led to the loss or injury.  In 1996, the 
reduction from contributory negligence totaled approximately
$94 million.
 
States differ in the role played by a plaintiff's own negligence 
in determining whether, or the extent to which, the defendant is 
liable for a plaintiff's damages.
 
Based on these differences, States are classified below into one of 
four categories.  Note: Whether a State was classified as modified 
comparative negligence, pure comparative negligence, pure
contributory negligence, or mixed rule depended on general 
characteristics of its civil laws.  If the focus were on specific 
types of civil cases, the classification might differ from what is 
shown here.  States do not always use the same decision rules for 
each type of civil case.
 
Modified comparative negligence
 
Nine States have a modified comparative negligence rule (the "50% 
bar to recovery" rule) which stipulates that the plaintiff can recover 
damages only if he or she is less negligent than the defendant.
 
Arkansas       Kansas           Utah
Colorado       Maine            West Virginia
Idaho          North Dakota     Wyoming
 
Eighteen States use a modified comparative negligence rule (the "51% 
bar to recovery" rule)under which the plaintiff can recover damages
only if he or she is not more negligent than the defendant.
 
Connecticut             New Hampshire
Hawaii                  New Jersey
Illinois                Ohio
Indiana                 Oklahoma
Iowa                    Oregon
Massachusetts           Pennsylvania
Montana                 Texas
Minnesota               Vermont
Nevada                  Wisconsin
 
Pure comparative negligence
 
Thirteen States use a pure comparative negligence rule under 
which a plaintiff can recover damages to the extent that the defendant 
is responsible for the plaintiff's injuries.
 
Alaska           Louisiana        New Mexico
Arizona          Michigan         New York
California       Mississippi      Rhode Island
Florida          Missouri         Washington
Kentucky
 
Pure contributory negligence
 
Six States use a pure contributory negligence rule that bars recovering 
damages from the defendant if the plaintiff's own negligent conduct 
contributed in any way to his or her own injuries.
 
Alabama         Maryland           South Carolina
Delaware        North Carolina     Virginia
 
Mixed rules
 
Four States have a blend of rules and do not fit into any single 
category.
 
Georgia         South Dakota
Nebraska        Tennessee

Number of days in trial

Trials conducted in the Nation's 75 largest counties lasted
3.9 days on average; the median number of days was 3.0 (not shown
in table).  Jury trials lasted an average of 4.7 days compared to
1.9 days for bench trials.  The median number of days in a jury
trial was 3.0, and in bench trials it was 1.0 day.  The longest
jury trial recorded in the sample lasted 73 days, and the longest
bench trial, 27 days.    

Half of all tort and contract bench trials lasted 1 day or less
compared to 3 days or less for jury tort trials and 4 days or less
for jury contract trials.  Among specific types of cases, auto
tort cases disposed of by bench trials lasted on average 1.4
days compared to 3.4 days among those disposed by jury trial. 


Case processing time

Among all trial cases, the average case processing time from
filing of the complaint to final verdict or judgment was 25.6
months, with half of the 13,358 cases taking 20.9 months or
more (table 11).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  
Tort cases, as a whole, reached final verdict or judgment in an 
average of 26.7 months compared to 23.5 months for contract cases.
Asbestos cases had the longest case processing time, averaging
about 50.2 months from filing to final verdict or judgment,
followed by medical malpractice cases with an average of 34.1
months. 
Fifty-nine percent of all trial cases were disposed of within 2 years.
Over half of asbestos cases and a fifth of medical malpractice 
cases were disposed of in 4 or more years.  Nine percent of real 
property cases and 7% of contract cases went from filing to 
termination in 4 years or more.

Overall, bench trial cases were disposed of more quickly than
jury trial cases.  About two-thirds (70%) of bench trial cases
were disposed of in less than 2 years compared to 56% of jury 
trial cases.  Within 3 years from filing, 94% of bench
cases and 88% of jury cases were disposed (figure 2).

The difference between bench and jury trials in case processing
time was evident in several types of civil cases disposed of in
the Nation's 75 largest counties during 1996.  Half of tort
bench cases went from filing of the complaint to final verdict
or judgment in at least 19.1 months compared to 22.0 months for
tort cases decided by a jury.  

In less than 2 years, 95% of slander/libel tort cases decided
by a bench trial were disposed, compared to 56% of those decided
by a jury. About three-quarters of professional (75%) and medical
(72%) malpractice bench cases went from filing to disposition within
2 years compared to less than half of professional (45%) and medical
(37%) malpractice cases disposed of by a jury (table 12).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

The median case processing time for contract cases disposed of
by a bench trial was 16.8 months compared to 22.6 months for
cases disposed of by jury trial.

Similarly, half of real property bench cases were processed in
at least 18.3 months compared to 25.6 months among jury cases (table 12).

Among eminent domain cases, the median case processing time for
bench trials was 8.3 months compared to 25.8 months for jury cases   a
median difference of nearly 1.5 years.  Eminent domain cases are those
in which a governmental entity has the power to convert privately owned
property, particularly land, to public use, subject to reasonable compensation.


County-specific data

The number of jury and bench trials, percentage of plaintiff
winners, final awards, and punitive damage award amounts varied
across the individual State courts sampled in this project
(appendix tables B, C, D and E).  Many factors account for these
differences across State courts such as State civil justice laws
and the types of cases disposed of by trial.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Comparison of 1992 and 1996 jury trial cases
 
 
*In 1992, jury trials in the Nation's 75 largest counties disposed 
over 12,000 tort, contract, and real property cases compared to just
over 10,000 in 1996.  This  decrease in the number of jury cases from
1992 to 1996, however, was not statistically significant.


*In 1992, plaintiffs won 52% of all jury trial cases.  In 1996, 
plaintiffs were successful in 49% of all jury trials.  Among contract 
cases, plaintiffs were more likely to win in jury trial cases in 1992 
(63%) than in 1996 (56%).  Plaintiffs won in about half of tort 
cases in 1992 (50%) and 1996 (48%).
 

*Among specific types of cases, plaintiffs were more successful in
medical malpractice, professional malpractice, buyer plaintiff,
and rental/lease cases in 1992 compared to 1996. 
 
*When adjusted for inflation, the median total award in 1996 was 
$35,000 compared to $58,000 in 1992.  There was no significant difference,
however, between the total amount of compensatory and punitive damages
awared by juries in 1992 ($3 billion when adjusted for inflation) and 
1996 ($2.4 billion).
 
*In 1992, 364 jury trial cases or 6% of all plaintiff winner cases were
awarded punitive damages that totaled over $300 million when adjusted
for inflation. This did not differ statistically from the more than
$545 million in punitive damages awarded to 212 or 4% of plaintiff
winner cases in 1996.  

*In both 1992 and 1996, plaintiff winners in contract cases were more
likely to receive punitive damages than plaintiff winners in tort cases.

In this study, cases are classified by the primary case type, though many
cases involve multiple claims (contract and tort). Under laws in
almost all States, only tort claims qualify for punitive damages.  If a
contract or real property case involved punitive damages, it involved
a related tort claim.
Punitive damage awards may be incomplete for 4 counties:  Palm Beach
Co., FL, Wayne Co., MI, Allegheny Co., PA, and Philadelphia Co., PA.
a/Excludes cases with a directed verdict, cases in which both the plaintiff
and defendant won damages, cases in which the plaintiff won the liability
trial and cases in which the defendant won the liability trial.
b/Eminent domain cases are not calculated among final awards because
there is always an award; the issue is how much the defendant (whose
property is being condemned) will receive for the property.

Methodology

Definitions of disposition types: 

Jury trial: A trial held before and decided by a group of 
laypersons selected according to the law presided over by
a judge culminating in a verdict for the plaintiff(s) and/or
defendant(s).

Bench trial (non-jury trial):  A trial held in the absence 
of a jury and decided by a judge culminating in a judgment 
for the plaintiff(s) or defendant(s).

Directed verdict:  In a case in which the party with the burden
of proof has failed to present a prima facie case for jury
consideration, a trial judge may order the entry of a verdict
without allowing the jury to consider it, because, as a matter
of law, there can be only one such verdict. 

Judgment notwithstanding the verdict:  ("JNOV" or Judgment non
obstante veredicto):  A judgment rendered in favor of one party
despite the finding of a jury verdict in favor of the other
party.

Jury trials for defaulted defendants:  Some states make
provisions for a jury to be empaneled even if the defendants in
a case fail to appear and enter a defense.  The purpose of a
trial is to decide issues such as amount of damages.  See
Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 1.500, section (e).


Definitions of civil case types:

Torts:  Claims arising from personal injury or property damage
caused by negligent or intentional acts of another person or
business.  Specific tort case types include: automobile
accident;  premise liability (injury caused by the dangerous
condition of residential or commercial property); medical
malpractice (by doctor, dentist, or medical professional); other
professional malpractice (e.g. by engineers, architects);
product liability (injury or damage caused by defective
products; injury caused by toxic substances such as asbestos);
libel/slander (injury to reputation); intentional tort (vandalism,
intentional personal injury); and other negligent acts (negligence
against another party for an act not represented by the other case
categories used in this study such as a the negligent supervision
of a dog resulting in an attack).

Contracts:  Cases which include all allegations of breach of
contract.  Specific case types include seller plaintiff (sellers
of goods or services, including lenders, seek payment of money
owed to them by a buyer, including  borrowers); buyer plaintiff
(purchaser of goods or services seeking return of their money,
recision of the contract, or delivery of the specified goods);
mortgage contract/foreclosure (foreclosures on real property,
commercial, or residential; because the title to real property
is transferred to the lender if the claim is successful it could
be included under real property cases); fraud (financial damages
incurred due to intentional or negligent misrepresentation
regarding a product or company; fraud is also considered a type of tort
claim, but because it arises out of commercial transactions, it
was included under contracts); employment discrimination (claim
against an employer for unfair treatment or denial of normal
privileges due to race, gender, religion, age, handicap and/or
nationality); other employment dispute (claim against an
employer for wrongful termination not based on discrimination or
by the employer or the employee claiming contractual failure of
the other party); rental/lease agreement; tortious interference
with a commercial or contractual relationship (this tort
consists of four elements: existence of a valid contract,
defendant's knowledge of that contract, defendant's intentional 
procuring of breach of that contract and damages); and other 
contract claims (any contractual dispute other than the case 
categories used in this study such as partnership claims, 
stockholder claims, and subrogation issues). 
 
Real Property:  Any claim regarding ownership of real property
(excluding mortgage foreclosures which are included under
contracts). Specific categories used include:  eminent domain
(condemnation of real property to obtain for public use); other
real property (any other claim regarding title to or use of real
property).

Sample

The sample design for the 1996 civil trial study was 
the same was one used for the 1992 civil jury study.  
The sample is a 2-stage stratified sample with 45 of the 
75 most populous counties selected at the first stage.  
The 75 counties were divided into 4 strata based on civil  
disposition data for 1990 obtained through telephone inter-
views with court staff in the general jurisdiction trial 
courts.  Stratum 1 consisted of the 14 counties with the 
largest number of civil case dispositions. Every county in 
stratum 1 was selected for the sample.  Stratum 2 consisted  
of 15 counties with 12 chosen for the sample.  From strata 
3, 10 of the 20 counties were selected. Nine of the 26 
counties in stratum 4 were included in the sample.  

The second stage of the sample design involved generating 
lists of cases that would be coded.  Prior to 
drawing the 1996 case sample, each participating jurisdiction 
was asked to identify a list of cases that had been disposed 
by jury trial or bench trial between January 1, 1996, and 
December 31, 1996. Trial cases were to meet the definitional 
criteria for jury and bench trials as defined in Black's 
Law Dictionary: (1) A jury trial was defined as "a trial held 
before and decided by a jury of laypersons and presided over 
by a judge culminating in a verdict for the plaintiff(s) or 
defendant(s), and (2) A bench trial was defined as "a trial 
held in the absence of a jury and decided by a judge culminating 
in a judgment for the plaintiff(s) or defendant(s)."  Cases that 
did not meet these definitional criteria were not to be included 
in the jury and bench lists.

The study plan was to obtain approximately 300 jury and 300
bench cases from the court of general jurisdiction in each of
the counties selected for the study.  In courts that reported
approximately 300 or less jury or bench trials, all trials were
to be coded.  In courts that reported more than 300 jury or 300
bench trials, a list of cases was to be provided to project
staff and a random sample of 275 drawn from the jury and bench
trial case list.  For jury and bench case lists in which the case
type was known, any remaining medical malpractice, professional
malpractice and product liability cases not initially selected
were to be included in the sample in order to over sample these
case types.

At the second stage of sampling for jury cases, all tort,
contract, and real property rights cases disposed by bench
verdict between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 1996, were
selected in 41 jurisdictions.  In the 1 jurisdiction where the
total number of bench cases disposed exceeded 300 and the case
type could be identified, a random sample of about 275 cases was
drawn from a list of tort, contract, and real property bench
trials. Any remaining medical malpractice, professional malpractice
and product liability cases not initially chosen in the random sample
also were included.  In the 3 jurisdictions where the total number of 
bench cases disposed exceeded 300 and case type could not be
identified, a random sample of about 275 tort, contract, and real
property rights cases were selected from the list of bench trials.

During the coding process in all sites, it was discovered that 
some courts included in their list some jury and bench trials 
that did not meet the study definitional criteria of a trial.  
These cases were excluded from the database.  By excluding cases
that did not meet the study criteria, some jurisdictions in which
sampling was utilized have final sample sizes of less than 275 cases.

Data on 6,713 civil jury trial cases and 2,312 civil trial 
bench cases that meet the study criteria were collected in the 45
courts. The final sample consisted of 9,025 tort, contract, and 
real property rights case disposed of by jury or bench verdict.


Populations of jury and bench trials

In jurisdictions where second stage case sampling was not used,
the populations of jury and bench trials reported are based on
applying the study criteria in each site and excluding cases
that did not meet the study definitions.

In the jurisdictions where second stage sampling was used, the
true population of trial verdicts according to the study
definitions could not be known.  It was impossible to know the
number of cases that failed to meet the definitional criteria
of a trial among the cases that did not make it into the sample.
The true population within each of these jurisdictions,
therefore, was estimated by applying the same rejection rate
generated from the selected sample after it was coded.  For
example, Orange County reported 340 jury trials in 1996.  A
random sample of 275 cases was chosen and when coded accor-
ding to study criteria produced 221 jury trial verdicts.  This
translates into a reject rate of 20% of the cases since 20%
did not meet the definitional criteria of a jury trial.  Applying
this rejection rate to the original list of 374 jury trial 
cases provided by the jurisdiction resulted in an estimated
population of 301 jury trials.


Sampling error

Since the data in this report came from a sample, a sampling
error (standard error) is associated with each reported number. 
In general, if the difference between 2 numbers is greater than
twice the standard error for that difference, there is
confidence that for 95 out of 100 possible samples a real
difference exists and that the apparent difference is not simply
the result of using a sample rather than the entire popula-
tion.  All differences discussed in the text of this report 
were statistically significant at or above the 95 percent
confidence level.


Data recoding and unobtainable 
information

For each sampled case, a standard coding form was manually
completed by on-site court staff to record information about the
litigants, case type, processing time and award amounts.

Information for which data were not available or collected
included the cost of litigation for the parties involved, as
well as for others; the actual disbursement of awards; and the
number of cases appealed.
