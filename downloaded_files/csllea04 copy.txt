BJS Statistician

In September 2004, 17,876 State and local law enforcement
agencies with the equivalent of at least 1 full-time officer 
were operating in the U.S. The total included:

* 12,766 local police departments
* 3,067 sheriffs' offices
* 49 primary State law enforcement agencies 
* 1,481 special jurisdiction agencies 
* 513 other agencies, primarily county constable offices in
  Texas.

State and local law enforcement agencies employed nearly 1.1
million persons on a full-time basis, including 732,000 sworn 
personnel (defined in the census as those with general arrest
powers). These agencies also employed approximately 105,000
part-time employees, including 46,000 sworn officers.

Local police departments were the largest employer of sworn
officers, accounting for 61% of the total. Sheriffs' offices 
were next, accounting for 24%. The remainder were employed 
by the 49 primary State law enforcement agencies (8%) or 
special jurisdiction agencies (7%).

Most State and local law enforcement agencies were small, with 
about half employing fewer than 10 officers. These agencies 
accounted for 5% of all sworn personnel. Nearly two-thirds of 
sworn personnel were employed by the 6% of agencies that 
employed 100 or more officers.

From 2000 to 2004, full-time employment by State and local law 
enforcement agencies nationwide increased overall by 57,400 
(or 5.6%). Sworn personnel increased by 23,900 (or 3.4%), and 
nonsworn by 33,500 (or 10.8%). The number of sworn personnel 
added from 2000 to 2004 was less than the increase observed 
from 1996 to 2000 (44,500) or from 1992 to 1996 (55,400).

The number of total full-time employees per 100,000 residents
rose from 362 in 2000 to 367 in 2004; however, the number of 
full-time sworn officers per 100,000 residents declined from 
252 to 249.

From 2000 to 2004, sworn employment rose by 1% in local police 
departments, 6% in sheriffs' offices, and 2% in State law 
enforcement agencies. Sheriffs' offices increased their number 
of nonsworn employees by 17% compared to 1% for local police 
and State law enforcement agencies.

Although local police employment was up slightly nationwide
from 2000 to 2004, 20 of the nation's 50 largest local police 
departments saw a decline in sworn personnel during this 
period, including 6 of the 7 largest. The New York City 
Police Department remained the nation's largest law 
enforcement agency in 2004, with 36,118 officers, but it
employed 11% fewer officers than in 2000.

Since 1992, the first year of the census, State and local law
enforcement employment increased by 230,400 (or 27%). The 
number of sworn personnel grew by about 123,800 (or 20%), and
nonsworn personnel rose by 106,600 (or 45%). During the same
period the number of violent crimes reported nationwide 
decreased by 29%.

More than half of State and local law enforcement 
personnel worked for local police departments

Local police departments were the largest employer of law
enforcement personnel with about 573,000 (or 53%) of the 
nearly 1.1 million employees nationwide. Sheriffs' offices
employed 326,531 (or 30%) of the total. The 49 primary State
law enforcement agencies accounted for 8% of the total, the 
same percentage as special jurisdiction agencies (those that
served a special geographic jurisdiction or had special
enforcement or investigative responsibilities). See table 7 
for types of special jurisdiction agencies.

About 447,000 (or 61%) of all sworn State and local law
enforcement employees were local police officers. Sheriffs' 
offices accounted for about 175,000 (or 24%) of the total. 
The 49 primary State law enforcement agencies employed 
about 58,000 (or 8%) of the total, and special jurisdiction 
agencies about 49,000 (or 7%).

Six percent of law enforcement agencies employed 
64% of sworn personnel

About 1,100 (or 6%) of State and local law enforcement agencies 
employed 100 or more full-time sworn personnel. This included 79 
agencies with 1,000 or more officers. Agencies with 100 or more 
officers employed 64% of all full-time sworn personnel, and those 
with 1,000 or more officers employed 30%. About half of agencies 
employed fewer than 10 full-time officers, and nearly a third(31%) 
employed fewer than 5 officers. Among these smaller agencies, 
about 2,200 (12% of agencies overall) had just 1 full-time officer 
or only part-time officers.

The largest agencies rarely used part-time sworn officers,
accounting for just 0.3% of all such personnel nationwide (not 
shown in table). About half (49%) of part-time sworn 
personnel were employed by agencies with fewer than 10 
full-time officers, and about two-thirds (69%) worked
for agencies with fewer than 25 full-time officers.

Growth in law enforcement personnel from 2000 to 2004 
was less than in prior 4-year periods 

From 2000 to 2004, the number of full-time State and local
law enforcement employees increased about 57,400 (or 5.6%). 
This included an increase in sworn personnel of about 
23,900 (or 3.4%). Civilian employment rose 33,500 (or 
10.8%).

Fewer sworn personnel were added from 2000 to 2004 than 
from 1996 to 2000 (44,500), or from 1992 to 1996 (55,400). 
The 33,500 nonsworn employees added from 2000 to 2004 were 
less than from 1996 to 2000 (53,000) but exceeded the 
number added from 1992 to 1996 (20,000).

From 1992 (the year of the first census) to 2004, State and
local law enforcement agencies added about 230,400 full-time 
employees, including 123,800 sworn officers and 106,600 
nonsworn employees. During this time the number of violent 
crimes handled by law enforcement agencies nationwide 
decreased by more than 565,000.

Nationwide ratio of sworn State and local law 
enforcement personnel to population was lower in
2004 than in 2000

In September 2004 State and local law enforcement agencies
had 367 full-time employees per 100,000 residents nationwide. 
This represented an increase of 1% since 2000 and 11% since
1992. There were 249 sworn personnel per 100,000 residents 
nationwide in 2004, a decrease of 1% from 2000, but still 
5% higher than in 1992. In 2004 the 117 nonsworn personnel
per 100,000 residents nationwide was 5% more than in 2000,
and 26% more than in 1992. From 1992 to 2004, the number 
of reported UCR violent crimes per 100,000 residents 
dropped 39%.

From 1992 to 2004, local police departments accounted 
for most of the increase in sworn personnel; sheriffs' 
offices for most of the increase in nonsworn personnel

Employment by sheriffs' offices grew by 45% from 1992 to 2004, 
including a 28% increase in sworn personnel and a 71% increase 
in nonsworn employees. In local police departments, sworn 
employment rose 19% during this period, and in State law 
enforcement agencies, 10%. Both recorded a 21% increase in 
nonsworn employees.

The 72,450 local police officers added from 1992 to 2004
accounted for 59% of the growth in sworn law enforcement 
personnel overall. Sheriffs' offices added nearly 63,000 
civilian employees during this period, accounting for 59% 
of the overall increase in nonsworn employment.

Nearly 13,000 local police departments operated in the 
U.S. during 2004
In September 2004, 12,766 local police departments were
operating in the United States. Nearly all (98%) were 
operated by a single municipality. The remainder were 
operated by a county or tribal government, or served 
multiple jurisdictions under a regional or joint 
arrangement.

A majority of local police departments employed fewer 
than 10 full-time officers

Most local police departments were small, but most local
police officers worked for larger agencies. Departments 
with fewer than 10 full-time officers comprised 55% of all 
agencies, but employed just 6% of all officers. About 600 
(4.7%)local police departments employed 100 or more 
full-time sworn personnel. These agencies employed 60% of 
all local police officers.

An annual average of about 8,000 local police officers 
were added from 1992 to 2000, compared to fewer than 
2,000 per year from 2000 to 2004

From 2000 to 2004, overall full-time employment by local
police departments increased by about 7,200(or 1.3%). The 
number of full-time sworn personnel increased by about 6,000
(1.4%) during this period. The number of civilian employees
rose by about 1,200, or 0.9%.

Although the number of local police officers nationwide 
increased by more than 72,000 from 1992 to 2004, more than 
90% of this increase occurred between 1992 and 2000.

Six of the seven largest local police departments 
employed fewer officers in 2004 than in 2000 

The New York City Police Department (NYPD), with 36,118 full-
time officers, is the largest police department in the U.S. 
(see appendix table 4 for the 50 largest local police 
departments). It employed 11% fewer officers in 2004 than in 
2000. Despite a decrease, the NYPD still employed nearly 3 
times as many officers as the next largest agency the Chicago 
Police Department(13,129). Other police departments that 
employed 5,000 or more officers included those in Los Angeles 
(9,099), Philadelphia (6,832), and Houston (5,092).

Overall, 20 of the nation's 50 largest local police departments 
had fewer officers in 2004 than in 2000, including 6 of the 7 
largest. Five of the 50 largest departments experienced a drop 
of more than 10% in the number of officers:

* Detroit (MI) Police (-15%)
* Nassau County (NY) Police (-15%)
* Cleveland (OH) Police (-14%)
* Newark (NJ) Police (-11%)
* New York (NY) Police (-11%)

The largest gains in sworn personnel were in police departments 
serving Las Vegas (NV) (23%), Austin (TX) (19%), Fairfax County 
(VA) (17%), Atlanta (GA)(11%), and Albuquerque (NM) (11%).

All but three States and the District of Columbia had
sheriffs' offices in 2004

A total of 3,067 sheriffs' offices operated with the equivalent 
of at least 1 full-time officer during 2004. Nearly every 
county in the U.S. operated a sheriff's office. Alaska, 
Connecticut, the District of Columbia, and Hawaii did not have 
sheriffs' offices (see appendix table 5 for State-by-State data). 
Overall, sheriffs' offices employed 326,531 persons full time, 
including about 175,000 sworn personnel.

About 11% of sheriffs' offices employed at least 100
full-time sworn personnel

In September 2004, 12 sheriffs' offices employed 1,000 or more 
full-time sworn officers, accounting for 18% of all such 
personnel. The largest of these was the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department with 8,239 full-time sworn personnel 
(see appendix table 6 for the 50 largest sheriffs' offices). 

A total of 351 (11%) sheriffs' offices employed at least 100
sworn personnel, accounting for 65% of full-time officers. 
More than 900 (30%) offices operated with fewer than 10 full-
time sworn personnel, employing 3% of all officers.

From 2000 to 2004, employment in sheriffs' offices 
increased by 11%

Since June 2000, total full-time employment in sheriffs'
offices was up by about 33,000, or 11.1%. The number of sworn 
personnel increased by about 10,000, or 6.3%, and the number 
of nonsworn employees by more than 22,000, or 17%. These 
increases were larger than those observed for local police, 
a difference due in part to the broader range of functions
performed by most sheriffs' offices.

Nearly all sheriffs' offices performed law enforcement 
and court-related functions; about 4 in 5 operated at 
least one jail

Ninety-six percent of sheriffs' offices were responsible for
traditional law enforcement functions, such as responding to 
citizen requests for service, providing routine patrol 
services, and conducting traffic enforcement. A similar 
percentage performed court-related duties, such as serving 
process (97%) and providing court security (97%). In addition, 
78% were responsible for operating at least one jail. 
Nationwide, sheriffs' offices had the equivalent of 59% of 
their full-time sworn personnel assigned to law enforcement
operations, 23% to jail operations, and 12% to court operations.

From 2000 to 2004, full-time sworn personnel of the 49
primary State law enforcement agencies rose by 3.3%

In September 2004, the 49 primary State law enforcement agencies 
had 89,265 full-time employees. This was 2,237 (or 2.6%) more 
than in 2000. These agencies employed 58,190 full-time sworn 
personnel in 2004, an increase of 1,842 (or 3.3%) compared to 
2000. Civilian employment rose by 1.3% during this period. 

The California Highway Patrol was the largest State law
enforcement agency

Overall, 19 of the 49 primary State law enforcement agencies
employed at least 1,000 full-time officers in 2004, two more 
than in 2000. The largest, the California Highway Patrol, had 
7,085 full-time sworn personnel, followed by the New York 
State Police(4,667), Pennsylvania State Police(4,200), Texas 
Department of Public Safety (3,437), and New Jersey State 
Police (2,768). The smallest agencies were the North Dakota 
Highway Patrol (135), South Dakota Highway Patrol(154), and 
Wyoming Highway Patrol (188).

In terms of full-time officers per 100,000 residents, the
Delaware State Police (77), Alaska State Troopers (58), and 
Vermont State Police (52) had the highest ratios. The lowest 
ratios were for the Wisconsin State Patrol (9), Florida 
Highway Patrol (10), and the Georgia State Patrol (10).

More than 10,000 full-time sworn personnel were 
employed at 4-year public universities and colleges

Nearly 1,500 State and local law enforcement agencies served
a special geographic jurisdiction or had special enforcement 
or investigative responsibilities during 2004. These agencies
employed about 85,000 persons full time, including more than
49,000 sworn personnel. More than two-thirds of special 
jurisdiction agencies served public buildings and facilities, 
employing more than 19,000 sworn personnel. Within this group, 
about 500 campus police departments served 4-year public 
institutions. These agencies employed more than 10,000
officers.

The second largest group of special jurisdiction agencies was
those responsible for enforcing conservation laws and providing 
law enforcement services for parks and recreation areas. These
205 agencies employed more than 14,000 full-time sworn
personnel. 

Special police departments tasked with safeguarding
transportation systems and facilities employed more 
than 9,000 full-time sworn personnel

A total of 130 special police departments served transportation-
related jurisdictions, such as mass transit systems, airports, 
bridges, tunnels, and port facilities. These agencies employed
about 9,100 full-time sworn officers. The largest, the Port
Authority of New York and the New Jersey Police Department, 
employed 1,607 officers in 2004, 25% more than in 2000. The 
Port Authority Police served: LaGuardia, Kennedy, and Newark
Airports; the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels; the George 
Washington and Staten Island Bridges; the PATH train system; 
the Port Authority Bus Terminal; and the Port Newark and Port
Elizabeth Marine Terminals. 

Many of the nation's largest transit systems had their own
dedicated police forces. The five largest were in the New York, 
Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Boston metropolitan
areas. Collectively, the 10 largest transit police departments 
employed 20% more sworn personnel in 2004 than in 2000.

Methodology
The 2004 Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies
(CSLLEA) data collection form was mailed to more than 19,000 
agencies potentially operating nationwide. This master list 
was created by compiling information from the following 
sources:

* The 2000 CSLLEA
* Lists provided by Peace Officer Standards and Training
  offices and other State agencies 
* A FBI list of agencies requesting new identifiers since the
  2000 CSLLEA 

Responses were received through website, fax, and mail options. 
Responding agencies were screened for eligibility to be included 
in the final CSLLEA database. Agencies were excluded if any of 
the following conditions existed on the CSLLEA reference date 
of September 30, 2004.

* The agency was not operational 
* The agency did not employ personnel with general arrest powers
* The agency contracted or outsourced to another agency for
  performance of all services
* The agency employed only part-time officers and the total
  combined hours worked for these officers averaged less than 
  35 hours per week
* All sworn officers volunteered their time on an unpaid basis
* The agency was not operated with any funds from a State,
  local, special district, or tribal government.

-----------------------------------------------------------
 The Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies 
(CSLLEA) officers'  counts were more inclusive than those 
from other series

 The annual counts of sworn personnel in the Uniform 
Crime Reporting (UCR) and the BJS' Justice and Expenditure 
and Employment (E & E) series, like  those from the CSLLEA, 
include only full-time employees with arrest powers.
The CSLLEA includes all officers with arrest powers 
regardless of function. The UCR data collected by the FBI 
exclude officers not paid out of police funds. This 
generally excludes employees working for jails or courts.

A similar exclusion is found in the sample data from the 
Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Public Employment published 
by BJS in the E & E series. E & E categorizes justice system 
employees by function: police protection, judicial and legal, 
or corrections.

Another reason the UCR counts are lower than those from the 
CSLLEA is that the UCR excludes some agencies that do not 
have an Originating Agency Identification (ORI) number 
assigned by the FBI. Some agencies without an ORI are still 
included in the UCR employee counts (but not in the agency
counts), because they report their data to another agency 
which in turn reports it to the FBI. The UCR data cover 95% 
of the U.S. population.

Generally the employment trends reported by the CSLLEA, UCR, 
and the E & E have been similar over time, with the main 
difference being the lower totals reported by the UCR and 
E & E
