* In 1996 State court prosecutors' offices employed about 71,000
attorneys, investigators, and support staff. The staff total had
increased 25% from 1992 to 1996.

* About three-fourths of all offices reported employing a
full-time prosecutor compared to about half of all offices in 1990.

* On average, offices with a part-time chief prosecutor had the
smallest staff size, lowest percentage of staff members working
full time, and the smallest budgets.

* Almost half of all offices reported the use of DNA evidence
during plea negotiations or felony trials.  DNA evidence was
used most often for sex offenses (43%), followed by murder and
manslaughter (28%) and aggravated assault (4%) cases.

* Over three-fourths of all offices indicated having proceeded
against juveniles in criminal court. An  estimated 27,000 juveniles
were proceeded against in criminal court by prosecutors' offices in 1996.

------------------------------------------------------------
Prosecutors' offices serving districts of 1 million or more 
------------------------------------------------------------

* 30% of all staff employed by prosecutors' offices nationwide
worked in the 34 largest offices, which each serve 1 million or
more residents.

* Nearly three-fourths of offices serving districts of 1 million
or more reported that an assistant prosecutor was threatened or
assaulted.

* About half of the prosecutors' officesthat represented
districts of 1 million or more had a specialized unit or
designated attorney who handled juvenile cases in criminal court.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In 1996 State court prosecutors' offices employed approximately
71,000 attorneys, investigators, and support staff, with a
median annual budget of $254,000.  The median total staff was
nine.  In 1996 half of all offices closed 250 or more felony
cases with a conviction rate of 89%.  These findings are from
the 1996 National Survey of Prosecutors (NSP), the most recent
in a series of surveys also conducted in 1990, 1992, and 1994.


The 1996 survey sampled 308 chief prosecutors from the estimated
2,343 that try felony cases.  The nationally representative
sample was drawn from a list of all prosecutors' offices that
handle felony cases in State courts.  The study does not include
municipal attorneys or those county attorneys who primarily
operate in courts of limited jurisdiction.

A chief prosecutor is the attorney who advocates for the public
in felony cases and in a variety of other cases.  State law
determines the number of chief prosecutors and whether they are
elected or appointed.  Over 95% of chief prosecutors are elected
locally.  (See Prosecutors in State Courts, 1990, BJS Bulletin
NCJ 134500.)

Office titles for State court prosecutors include district
attorney, county attorney, prosecuting attorney, commonwealth attorney, 
and state's attorney.  (See Prosecutors in State Courts, 1994, BJS
Bulletin, NCJ 151656, Appendix 1.)  Nearly all prosecutors'
offices serve a county-based jurisdiction.  In 1996, 89% of
prosecutorial districts served one county compared to 80% in
1990.  Half of all offices in 1996 represented districts with a
population of 33,000 or less.  Three-quarters served districts
with fewer than 100,000 persons.

This report provides information about prosecutors' offices categorized 
by whether the chief prosecutor worked full or part-time and by the number 
of residents served. A full-time office in a large jurisdiction refers to 
an office with a full-time chief prosecutor in a jurisdiction of 1,000,000
or more persons.  A full-time office in a medium jurisdiction
refers to an office with a full-time chief prosecutor in a
jurisdiction between 250,000 and 999,999 persons.  A full-time
office in a small jurisdiction refers to an office with a
full-time chief prosecutor in a jurisdiction with fewer than
250,000 persons.  A part-time office has a part-time chief
prosecutor serving a jurisdiction of any size ***Footnote 1: 
The full-time office categories used in this report differ from
and are not comparable to the full-time categories in
Prosecutors in State Courts, 1994.  Appendix table A on page 8
contains the 1994 data in the current categories of full-time
offices.***

---------------------------------------------------
Cases handled by prosecutors' offices
---------------------------------------------------

Besides handling felony cases, 91% of all offices also had jurisdiction 
for misdemeanor cases; 82% handled traffic violations; 53%, child 
support enforcement; and 53% represented the government in civil lawsuits 
(table 1). Full-time small offices (84%) and part-time offices (83%) were
more likely to handle traffic violations than either the
full-time large (62%) or medium size offices (61%).  The
representation of the government in civil cases was also more
common in part-time offices than in full-time offices.  A larger
percentage of full-time large offices had responsibility for
child support enforcement compared to full-time offices of medium size.

Staffing of prosecutors' offices
--------------------------------------------------

In 1996 the Nation's prosecutors' offices employed a workforce
of about 71,000 full-time and part-time staff, including
assistant prosecutors, paralegals, investigators, victim
advocates, and support staff (table 2).  This total represents
an increase of 25% in total staff from 1992 and 9% from 1994. 
Support staff, including clerks and secretaries, comprised about
35% of total office staff.  Assistant prosecutors responsible
for at least some phase of felony criminal cases made up a third
of total staff.  The number of assistant prosecutors grew to
24,000 in 1996.  This represents an increase of 20% over the
number of assistant prosecutors in 1990, 13% more than the
number in 1992, and 8% more than in 1994.  In 1992 and 1994,
total employment in prosecutors' offices accounted for about 4%
of all State and local justice employment ***Footnote 2: 
Justice Expenditure and Employment Extracts, 1994, BJS report,
forthcoming, reports a total State and local justice system
employment of 1,901,773  in October 1994. Justice Expenditure
and Employment Extracts, 1992, BJS report, forthcoming, has a
total of 1,635,502 employees for October 1992.***

Survey question:  How many of the following 
types of staff members are employed in your 
office?
------------------------------------------------------


In 1996 almost three-quarters of all offices reported employing
a full-time chief prosecutor.   In 1990 the percentage of
full-time chief prosecutors was 53% nationwide.  Sixty percent
of all offices employed at least one full-time assistant
prosecutor.  Overall, 91% of the total staff positions were
full-time.  In part-time offices about 16% of staff members were
full-time employees. 

In 1996 the median total staff size was nine, including the
chief prosecutor (table 3).  Half of all offices reported three
or more assistant prosecutors, not including the chief
prosecutor.  In 1994 the median total staff size was eight, with
a median of two assistant prosecutors not including the chief
prosecutor.  In 1996 full-time offices in large jurisdictions had 
a median total staff size of 414, with a median of 163 assistant 
prosecutors, not including the chief prosecutor and 138 support staff.  
Half of part-time offices reported three or more staff members.

---------------------------------------------------
Length of service and salary of chief prosecutor
---------------------------------------------------

The median length of service for chief prosecutors nationwide
(elected or appointed) was 6.0 years.  Eighteen percent of all
chief prosecutors had served 2 years or less.  About a  quarter
had served 12 years or more.   The longest tenure among surveyed
respondents was 32 years.  In 1994  half of all chief
prosecutors had served 4.7 years or more. 

The median length of service for chief prosecutors in full-time
large offices was 6.6 years, for full-time medium offices, 6.0
years; for full-time small offices, 7.7 years; and for chief
prosecutors in part-time offices, 4.8 years.

In 1996 half of all offices reported that the chief prosecutor
earned $64,000 per year or more.  The median salary for chief
prosecutors in full-time large offices was $115,000; for
full-time medium offices, $97,000; for full-time small offices,
$69,000; and for chief prosecutors in part-time offices, $36,000
(shown in Highlights).

---------------------------------------------------
Budget of prosecutors' offices
---------------------------------------------------

In 1996 half of all offices received 88% or more of their funds
for prosecutorial functions from the county government. About
36% of offices relied exclusively on the county government for
their budget.  In 1994, 46% of offices reported receiving their
total prosecu-torial budget from the county government.  Almost
half of all offices indicated that some portion of their budget
came from State funds in 1996.  Twenty-nine percent of all
offices received funding from State and Federal grants in 1996
compared to 17% in 1994.  All surveyed part-time offices
received total funding from the county government.

Half of all offices reported an annual budget for prosecutorial
functions of $254,000 or more in 1996 (table 4).  The average
budget for all offices was nearly $1.5 million.  Reported
budgets ranged from $21,000 to $255 million.  In 1994, when
adjusted for inflation, the median budget for all offices was
$239,000, and the mean budget was $1.4 million.  There was no
statistically significant change in the adjusted mean budget
between 1994 and 1996.

The 34 largest prosecutors' offices in the Nation serve 24% of
the U.S. population.  The median population served was about 1.4
million.

Thirty percent of all staff employed by prosecutors' offices nationwide
worked in these 34 largest offices, including over 7,400 assistant prosecutors, 
1,800 investigators, and 7,000 support staff.  Virtually all (97%) of
the staff employed in these 34 offices worked full-time. 

Between 1994 and 1996 the mean budget when adjusted for
inflation for the 34 full-time large offices increased from $30
million to $35 million, an increase of 16%.

Approximately 438,000 felony cases were closed by the 34 largest
offices.  About 318,000 of the felony cases disposed of resulted
in a felony or misdemeanor conviction.  Prosecutors in the 34
largest offices handled over 20,000 trials disposed by jury
verdict.  

Overall, the 34 largest offices proceeded against 7,000
juveniles in criminal court.  About half of the offices had written
guidelines about proceeding against juveniles in criminal court
and a specialized unit or designated attorney that handled such
cases.  

Nearly three-fourths of offices serving 1 million or more
residents reported that an assistant prosecutor was threatened
or assaulted.

Prosecutors' offices with a part-time chief prosecutor, 1996

In about 26% of the Nation's prosecutors' offices the chief
prosecutor occupied a part-time position.  These offices serve a
population of approximately 16 million, representing almost 6%
of the total U.S. population.  The median population each office
served was about 17,000.

In 1996 the total workforce in offices with a part-time
prosecutor was 3,100, which accounted for 4% of the total
employment for all prosecutors' offices in the country. The
median staff size was three.

On average, offices with a part-time chief prosecutor had an
annual budget of $90,000 in 1996.  The sole source of funding
for part-time offices was their county governments.

Half of the part-time offices closed 221 criminal cases or more
in 1996.  In at least half of the offices, 96% of the cases
closed resulted in a conviction.  Most (97%) of the cases closed
by part-time offices were misdemeanor cases.  There was a median
of two felony jury trial verdicts.

In about a quarter of part-time prosecutors' offices, the chief
prosecutor was threatened or assaulted.  Twelve percent of
offices reported that an assistant prosecutor received a
work-related threat or assault.

In 1996, 15% of part-time offices used DNA evidence during
felony trials or plea negotiations.   Part-time offices most
often used DNA evidence in prosecuting cases dealing with sex
offenses.

About 40% of part-time offices indicated having office e-mail,
32% access to the Internet, 29% electronic research capabilities
and 11% access to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC).
-------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------
Number of cases and conviction
--------------------------------

In 1996 the median number of criminal cases closed by all
offices was 900 (table 5).  In at least half of all offices, 88%
of cases resulted in a felony or misdemeanor conviction.  The
median number of felony cases closed for all offices was 250,
with a median conviction rate of 89%.  Half of all offices were
involved with 8 or more felony jury trials that resulted in a
verdict.

In half of the full-time large offices, each office closed over
11,000 felony cases and 30,000 misdemeanor
cases.  In at least half of the full-time large offices, 90% of
felony cases and 77% of misdemeanor cases resulted 
in a conviction.  Half of part-time offices reported a
conviction rate of 93% or higher for felony cases and 98% or
higher for misdemeanor cases.  Full-time large offices were
involvedwith a median of 491 felony jury trials that resulted in
a verdict.  The median annual number of felony cases closed by
full-time medium offices was 2,928; by full-time small offices,
260; and by part-time offices 57.

Neither the number of felony cases closed nor the conviction
rates per office changed significantly between 1992 and 1996
(table 6).

Estimating the number of felony cases convicted in State courts

Estimates of the number of cases closed and convicted are based
on information supplied by less than 50% of prosecutors' offices
nationwide (tables 5 and 6).  

The BJS National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP), which
compiles detailed information on sentences and characteristics
of convicted felons every 2 years, provides better and more
complete information on felony cases disposed in State courts
nationwide.  According to NJRP, State courts convicted
872,217 adults of a felony in 1994, a decrease from 893,630 in 1992.

Work-related threats or assaults against prosecutors' staff
------------------------------------------------------------

Almost half of all offices in 1996 indicated that a staff member
experienced a work-related threat or assault  (table 7).  This
was unchanged from 1994.  In 1992, 17% of offices reported that
their chief prosecutor was threatened or assaulted;  in 1996 the
percentage rose to 30%.

Survey questions:  In 1996, did your office use DNA evidence during plea negotiations 
or during felony trials?  For which type(s) of felony offenses did your office use DNA evidence  
during plea negotiations or trials?  Which laboratory (ies) performed the DNA analysis?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Various laboratories performed the DNA analysis for prosecutors'
offices.  Thirty-six percent of offices reported using a
State-operated forensic laboratory to analyze DNA evidence; 
20% reported a privately operated forensic laboratory; and 11%,
the FBI laboratory.

DNA evidence was used more often in full-time large and medium 
offices than in either full-time small or part-time offices.  
Regardless of office size, DNA evidence was primarily used in cases 
involving sex offenses.  Full-time large offices relied more extensively 
on privately operated forensic laboratories for DNA analysis
than other office types.  Almost 73% of full-time medium offices
reported using a State-operated forensic laboratory to conduct
the DNA analysis, as did 43% of full-time small offices, 39% of
full-time large offices, and 9% of part-time offices.

---------------------------------------------------
Juveniles proceeded against in criminal court
---------------------------------------------------

In 1996 three-fourths of all offices reported proceeding against
juveniles in criminal court (not shown in a table).  In 1994,
59% of all offices indicated handling juvenile cases transferred
to criminal court.



Overall, an estimated 27,000 juveniles were proceeded against in
criminal court by prosecutors' offices in 1996 (table 10).  Half
of all offices indicated having proceeded against 5 or more
juveniles in criminal court.  The median number of juveniles
proceeded against in criminal court by full-time large offices
was 93; by full-time medium offices, 24; full-time small
offices, 4; and part-time offices, 3.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:  Data were available for 1,337 of the 1,773 offices proceeding against juveniles 
in criminal court.  Data on a specialized unit or a designated attorney that handles juvenile 
cases proceeded against in criminal court were available for 2,313 offices.  Data on written 
guidelines about handling juvenile cases in criminal court were available for 2,257 offices.
*Juvenile cases proceeded against in criminal court include cases that reached criminal 
court by judicial waiver, statutory exclusion, direct filing by prosecutor's office, or any other 
mechanism available in the prosecutor's State. 

Survey questions:  In 1996, did your office proceed against any juveniles in criminal court?   
Does your office have a designated attorney(s) or a specialized unit that handles juvenile 
cases proceeded against in criminal court?   Does your office have written guidelines about
proceeding  against juvenile cases in criminal court?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A third of offices indicated that a specialized unit or
designated attorney(s) handled juvenile cases pros-
ecuted in criminal court.  Over 60% of full-time medium offices 
had a specialized unit that handled juveniles proceeded against 
in criminal court, as did 50% of full-time large offices, 34% of 
full-time small offices, and 29% of part-time offices.  

About 12% of all offices indicated having written guidelines
about proceeding against juvenile cases in criminal court. 
Full-time large offices were more likely than any other office
type to have written guidelines for proceeding against juveniles
in criminal court. 

-------------------------
Computerization
-------------------------

In 1996 about a third of all offices reported being part of an
integrated computerized system with other criminal justice
agencies.  In 1994 a little more than a quarter of all offices
indicated being part of such a system.  In 1996, 23% of offices
indicated being part of an integrated system with the courts,
16% with law enforcement, and 9% with district attorney offices 
statewide (table 11).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Over 76% of full-time large offices reported being part of an
integrated system, 72% of full-time medium offices, 37% of
full-time small offices, and 4% of part-time offices.  Full-time
offices were the most likely to be part of an integrated
computerized system with the courts, followed by law enforcement
agencies.

Nearly 46% of all offices indicated having electronic research
capabilities such as Westlaw or Lexis-Nexis, 40% indicated
having office e-mail, 36% having access to the Internet, 31%
access to the National Crime Information Center NCIC), and 4% a

Survey question:  Does your office have any of the following?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About 47% of full-time large offices reported having a web site
on the Internet, 30% of full-time medium offices, and 2% of
full-time small offices.  Over 70% of full-time large and medium
offices indicated access to the NCIC.

---------------------------------------------------
Appendix table A:  Accounting 
for changed full-time office categories, 1994 
---------------------------------------------------

The full-time office categories used for the 1996 NSP report
differ from those used for the 1994 NSP report.  The 1994
categories were changed because they resulted in an
overestimation of the number of offices representing districts
with a population of 500,000 or more.  In 1994 the BJS survey
estimated that there were 127 offices serving districts with a
population of 500,000 or more. The actual number was 107
offices.

In any sample survey, the weighted data from respondents provide
an estimate that may differ from the true value.  According to
categories of population that prosecutors' offices served, the
survey's estimated distribution of the number of offices in 1996
varied slightly from the actual count of those offices.

Note:  The actual number of  prosecutors' offices is based on a master list 
compiled by BJS for sampling purposes.  The 1996 county population value 
assigned to each office came from the U.S. Bureau of the Census web site, 
http://www.census.gov/population/www/estimates/countypop.html.

Methodology
------------

The chief prosecutors surveyed are a nationally representative
sample of those that prosecute felony cases in State courts of
general jurisdiction.  Questionnaires were mailed to 308 chief
prosecutors from the approximately 2,343 who try felony cases in
State courts.

Sampling frame

The sampling frame and sample used for the 1996 NSP is the same
as that employed for the 1994 NSP.  To construct the 1994 NSP
sampling frame, a list of all prosecutorial districts that
handle felony cases was compiled from the approximately 3,100
counties and independent cities in the U.S. (total = 2,343). 
Except for Connecticut, prosecutorial districts can comprise one
or more counties and independent cities.  To compile the list,
statutes for the 50 States and the District of Columbia were
reviewed to see how each State selects prosecutors and how
prosecutors are organized (such as by county, judicial district,
or geographical district).  A file was created that contained
the listing of the 2,343 prosecutorial districts, 1992
population figures, and 1992 UCR Part I adult arrest data by
county.  The file was sent to the Bureau of the Census to draw a
stratified systematic sample.

Sample

The 2,343 prosecutorial districts were grouped together into 6
strata, depending on the number of Part I adult arrests in 1992.
Within each stratum, districts were selected for the sample
based on 1992 population.  A sample of 308 districts was chosen
that is expected to yield a coefficient of variation of about 2
percent for sample estimates related to population size.

The creation of prosecutorial districts eliminated the
possibility that an individual prosecutor would be selected more
than once.  Each prosecutor had only one chance to be in the
sample.

Ideally, statistics computed using sample survey responses have
an "analysis weight" for conversion of sample results to
statistics applicable to the entire population.  In the NSP
context, the entire population is that 
of felony prosecutors in State courts.

The analysis weight that was applied to the data provided by the
sampled office was based on the inverse of the probability of
selection for NSP.  Each of the 94 offices in stratum 1 was
selected with certainty resulting in the weight of 1.  Some
statistical nonresponse adjustment was made for the 28 offices
in strata 3 to 6 that did not respond to the 1996 survey.  

Sampling error

Because the data in this report came from a sample, a sampling
error (standard error) is associated with each reported number
(Appendix table C).  In general, if the difference between two
numbers is greater than twice the standard error for that
difference, there is a 95-percent confidence of a real
difference that is not simply the result of using a sample
rather than the entire population.  All the differences
discussed in the text of this report were statistically
significant at or above the 95-percent confidence level.

Data collection
-----------------

The 1996 survey was conducted through a mailed questionnaire,
consisting of 14 questions that encompassed 123 items of
information.  The questionnaires were mailed to 
the survey participants by the Bureau of Justice Statistics in
June 1997. Follow-up continued until December 1997.  Of the 308
prosecutors' offices in the survey, 272 completed the
questionnaire (2 offices providing only partial information).  
For the five offices in Stratum 1 and three offices in Stratum 2
that did not complete the 1996 NSP questionnaire, staffing
information obtained from the 1994 NSP was used as estimates for
1996 staffing.  For the 1994 NSP, 269 offices completed the
survey, and for the 1992 NSP, 262 offices.

Overall, the survey response rate was about 88%.  Several kinds
of requested information were difficult for prosecutors= offices
to provide, such as workload statistics, data related to number
of juvenile transfers, and budget information.  About 40% of
survey respondents did not provide information on the number of
felony cases closed and 54% did not provide information on misdemeanor
cases closed.  Of the 240 office respondents that reported
proceeding against juveniles in criminal court, 12% were unable
to provide the number of cases handled.  In 1996 budget figures
for prosecutorial functions were missing in 11% of survey responses.
