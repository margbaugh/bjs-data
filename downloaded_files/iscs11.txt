Executive Summary
Introduction
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for teaching and learning, free of crime and violence. Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals involved, but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community (Henry 2000). 

Establishing good indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these indicators is important in ensuring the safety of our nation’s students. This is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety. 

This report is the fourteenth in a series of annual publications produced jointly by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), Institute of Education Sciences (IES), in the U.S. Department of Education, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) in the U.S. Department of Justice. This report presents the most recent data available on school crime and student safety. The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, and principals. Sources include results from a study of violent deaths in schools, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the National Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime Supplement to the survey, sponsored by the BJS and NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the Schools and Staffing Survey and School Survey on Crime and Safety, both sponsored by NCES. The most recent data collection for each indicator varied by survey, from 2007 to 2010. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design, or is the result of a universe data collection. All comparisons described in this report are statistically significant at the .05 level. Additional information about methodology and the datasets analyzed in this report may be found in appendix A. 

This report covers topics such as victimization, teacher injury, bullying, school conditions, fights, weapons, availability and student use of drugs and alcohol, and student perceptions of personal safety at school. Indicators of crime and safety are compared across different population subgroups and over time. Data on crimes that occur away from school are offered as a point of comparison where available.

Key Findings
Preliminary data show that there were 33 school-associated violent deaths from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010 (Indicator 1). In 2010, among students ages 12–18, there were about 828,000 nonfatal victimizations at school,  which include 470,000 victims of theft  and 359,000 victims of violence  (simple assault and serious violence ) (Indicator 2). In 2009–10, about 74 percent of public schools recorded one or more violent incidents of crime, 16 percent recorded one or more serious violent incidents, and 44 percent recorded one or more thefts (Indicator 6). The following key findings are drawn from each section of the report. 

Violent Deaths 
•	Of the 33 student, staff, and nonstudent school-associated violent deaths1 occurring between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010, 25 were homicides, 5 were suicides, and 3 were legal interventions. From July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010, there were 17 homicides and 1 suicide of school-age youth (ages 5–18) at school (Indicator 1).
•	During the school year 2008–09 there were 1,579 homicides among school-age youth ages 5–18, of which 17 occurred at school. During the 2008 calendar year, there were 1,344 suicides of youth ages 5–18, of which 7 occurred at school (Indicator 1).

Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization 
•	In 2010, students ages 12–18 were victims of about 828,000 nonfatal victimizations at school, including 470,000 thefts  and 359,000 violent victimizations,  91,400 of which were serious violent victimizations  (Indicator 2).
•	In 2010, a greater number of students ages 12–18 experienced total victimizations (theft and violent crime) at school than away from school. That year, 32 victimizations per 1,000 students occurred at school, and 26 victimizations per 1,000 students occurred away from school (Indicator 2).
•	In 2010, no measurable differences were found in the violent victimization rates at school vs. those away from school (Indicator 2).
•	The total crime victimization rate of students ages 12–18 at school declined from 43 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2009 to 32 victimizations per 1,000 students in 2010 (Indicator 2).
•	Four percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school9 during the previous 6 months in 2009 (Indicator 3). Three percent of students reported theft,10 1 percent reported violent victimization,11 and less than half of a percent reported serious violent victimization.12 In addition, students attending public schools reported being victimized at twice the rate of students attending private schools (4 percent vs. 2 percent). 
•	Eight percent of students in grades 9–12 reported being threatened or injured with a weapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, on school property in 2009. Specifically, 3 percent of students were threatened or injured with a weapon one time, 2 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon two or three times, 1 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon four to eleven times, and 1 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon twelve or more times  (Indicator 4).
•	In 2009, about 10 percent of male students in grades 9–12 reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property in the past year, compared to 5 percent of female students (Indicator 4).
•	During the 2007–08 school year, a greater percentage of teachers in city schools (10 percent) reported being threatened with injury than teachers in town schools (7 percent) and suburban or rural schools (6 percent each) (Indicator 5). A greater percentage of teachers in city schools (5 percent) and suburban schools (4 percent) reported being physically attacked, compared to teachers in rural schools (3 percent).
•	A greater percentage of secondary school teachers (8 percent) reported being threatened with injury by a student than elementary school teachers (7 percent) (Indicator 5). However, a greater percentage of elementary school teachers (6 percent) reported being physically attacked than secondary school teachers (2 percent). 

School Environment
•	During the 2009–10 school year, 85 percent of public schools recorded that one or more crime incidents had taken place at school, amounting to an estimated 1.9 million crimes (table 6.1). This figure translates to a rate of 40 crimes per 1,000 public school students enrolled in 2009–10. During the same year, 60 percent of public schools reported a crime incident that occurred at school to the police, amounting to 689,000 crimes—or 15 crimes per 1,000 public school students enrolled (Indicator 6).
•	In 2009–10, about 74 percent of public schools recorded one or more violent incidents of crime, 16 percent recorded one or more serious violent incidents, 44 percent recorded one or more thefts, and 68 percent recorded one or more other incidents.  Forty percent of public schools reported at least one violent incident to police, 10 percent reported at least one serious violent incident to police, 25 percent reported at least one theft to police, and 46 percent reported one or more other incidents to police (Indicator 6).
•	During the 2009–10 school year, 23 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a daily or weekly basis, and 9 percent reported widespread disorder in classrooms on a daily or weekly basis (Indicator 7). 
•	Sixteen percent of public schools reported that gang activities had occurred during the 2009–10 school year, and 2 percent reported that cult or extremist activities had occurred during this period. The percentages of public schools that reported gang activity at all at their schools during the school year decreased from 20 percent in 2007–08 to 16 percent in 2009–10 (Indicator 7).
•	Three percent of schools reported that student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse occurred at least once a week in 2009–10, lower than the 11 percent in 2007–08 (Indicator 7).
•	In 2009, about 20 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that there were gangs present at their schools (Indicator 8). Students in 6th grade reported a lower percentage of a gang presence at their school than students in grades 8 through 12. The percentage of students in 6th grade who reported a gang presence was not measurably different from students in 7th grade. There were no measurable differences in the percentages of male and female students who reported a gang presence at their schools in 2009.
•	The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them decreased from 32 percent in 1995 to 23 percent in 2009 (Indicator 9).
•	In 2009 in grades 9–12, higher percentages of American Indian/Alaska Native students (34 percent) and Hispanic students (31 percent) reported that drugs were made available to them on school property than Black students (22 percent), White students (20 percent), and Asian students (18 percent) (Indicator 9).
•	In 2009, about 9 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being targets of hate-related words at school and 29 percent of students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year (Indicator 10).
•	Higher percentages of Black students and Hispanic students (11 percent each) reported being targets of hate-related words at school than White students (7 percent) in 2009. In addition, a higher percentage of Hispanic students (32 percent) than White students (28 percent) reported seeing hate-related graffiti (Indicator 10).
•	In 2009, about 28 percent of 12- to 18-year-old students reported having been bullied at school during the school year and 6 percent reported having been cyber-bullied (Indicator 11). A higher percentage of females (20 percent) than males (13 percent) reported being the subject of rumors in 2009, while a lower percentage of females (8 percent ) than males (10 percent) reported being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on. Also, a higher percentage of females (6 percent) than males (4 percent) reported being excluded from activities on purpose. 
•	In 2009, about 39 percent of 6th-graders reported being bullied at school, compared with 33 percent of 7th graders, 32 percent of 8th-graders, 28 percent of 9th-graders, 27 percent of 10th-graders, 21 percent of 11th-graders, and 20 percent of 12th-graders (Indicator 11).
•	Six percent of students ages 12–18 reported being cyber-bullied in 2009. About 3 percent reported being subject to harassing text messages (Indicator 11). About 4 percent of females reported being subject to harassing text messages compared with 2 percent of males.
•	In 2007–08, about 34 percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and 32 percent reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching (Indicator 12). Seventy-two percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other teachers at their school enforced the school rules, and 89 percent reported that the principal enforced the school rules.
•	A higher percentage of secondary school teachers than elementary school teachers reported that student misbehavior (39 percent vs. 33 percent) and student tardiness and class cutting (45 percent vs. 26 percent) interfered with their teaching in 2007–08 (Indicator 12). During the same year, a lower percentage of secondary school teachers than elementary school teachers agreed that school rules were enforced by teachers (56 percent vs. 79 percent) and by the principal in their school (86 percent vs. 89 percent).

Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances
•	In 2009, about 31 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported they had been in a physical fight at least one time during the previous 12 months anywhere, and 11 percent said they had been in a fight on school property during the previous 12 months.  Generally, a higher percentage of students in 9th grade reported having been in fights than students in any other grade, both anywhere and on school property. Generally, a smaller percentage of Asian students reported being in fights anywhere and on school property than students of other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, 4 percent of males said they had been in a fight anywhere twelve or more times, compared to 1 percent of females, and 1 percent of males said they had been in a fight on school property twelve or more times, compared to less than half a percent of females (Indicator 13).
•	Between 1993 and 2009, the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon at least one day anywhere during the past 30 days declined from 22 percent to 17 percent, and the percentage who reported carrying a weapon at least one day on school property also declined, from 12 percent to 6 percent (Indicator 14).
•	In 2009, about 27 percent of males carried a weapon anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females, and 8 percent of males carried a weapon on school property, compared to 3 percent of females (Indicator 14).

•	Since 2003, there has been no measurable difference between the percentages of male and female students in grades 9–12 who reported alcohol consumption anywhere. However, there were differences in the reporting of how often alcohol was consumed in 2009. One percent of male students reported consuming alcohol anywhere all thirty days (figure 15.2 and table 15.3). In terms of alcohol use on school property, a greater percentage of males reported using alcohol at least one time during the previous 30 days than did females in every survey year (Indicator 15).
•	In 2009, about 21 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana anywhere in the past 30 days, while 5 percent reported using marijuana on school property. According to students’ reports, male students were twice as likely as females to use marijuana on school property (6 percent vs. 3 percent, respectively). Six percent of male students reported using marijuana anywhere 40 times or more during the previous 30 days, compared to 2 percent of females (Indicator 16).
•	Generally among 9th–12th-graders, the percentage of Asian students reporting using marijuana anywhere and on school property during the previous 30 days was smaller than that of most other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, the percentage of students reporting using marijuana anywhere increased with grade level: a smaller percentage of 9th-graders reported using marijuana anywhere (16 percent), than 10th-graders (21 percent), 11th-graders (23 percent), and 12th-graders (25 percent) (Indicator 16).

Fear and Avoidance

•	Higher percentages of 6th-graders and 7th-graders (6 percent each) reported being afraid of attack or harm at school than 8th-graders (4 percent) and 11th-graders (3 percent) (Indicator 17). 
•	The percentage of students who reported that they had avoided at least one school activity or one or more places in school during the previous school year because of fear of attack or harm decreased from 7 percent in 2007 to 5 percent in 2009. Specifically, in 2009, about 2 percent of students avoided at least one school activity, and 4 percent avoided one or more places in school (Indicator 18). 

Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures
•	During the 2009–10 school year, 39 percent of public schools (about 32,300 schools) took at least one serious disciplinary action against a student for specific offenses. Of the 433,800 serious disciplinary actions taken during the 2009–10 school year, 74 percent were suspensions for 5 days or more, 20 percent were transfers to specialized schools, and 6 percent were removals with no services for the remainder of the school year (Indicator 19). 
•	The percentage of public schools taking at least one serious disciplinary action declined over time between 1999–2000 (54 percent) and 2009–10 (39 percent); and the percentage was lower in 2009–10 than in 2007–08 (46 percent). (Indicator 19).

Avoiding one or more places in school includes avoiding the entrance, any hallways or stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside the school building.
19 Readers should note that this indicator relies on student reports of security measures and provides estimates based on students’ awareness of the measure rather than on documented practice. Selected security measures include, for example, controlling access during school hours, drug testing and prohibiting tobacco use, requiring ID badges, metal detectors, and sweeps and technology. For a more detailed list of selected security measures and a summary of the use of various security measures as reported by schools please see Indicator 20.

Foreword
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011 provides the most recent national indicators on school crime and safety. The information presented in this report is intended to serve as a reference for policymakers and practitioners so that they can develop effective programs and policies aimed at violence and school crime prevention. Accurate information about the nature, extent, and scope of the problem being addressed is essential for developing effective programs and policies. 

This is the fourteenth edition of Indicators of School Crime and Safety, a joint publication of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). This report provides detailed statistics to inform the nation about current aspects of crime and safety in schools. 

The 2011 edition of Indicators of School Crime and Safety includes the most recent available data, compiled from a number of statistical data sources supported by the federal government. Such sources include results from a study of violent deaths in schools, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC); the National Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime Supplement to the survey, sponsored by the BJS and NCES, respectively; the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored by the CDC; and the Schools and Staffing Survey and School Survey on Crime and Safety, both sponsored by NCES. 

The entire report is available on the Internet (http://nces.ed.gov/programs/crimeindicators/crimeindicators2011/). The Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National Center for Education Statistics continue to work together in order to provide timely and complete data on the issues of school-related violence and safety.

Introduction
Our nation’s schools should be safe havens for teaching and learning free of crime and violence. Any instance of crime or violence at school not only affects the individuals involved but also may disrupt the educational process and affect bystanders, the school itself, and the surrounding community (Henry 2000). For both students and teachers, victimization at school can have lasting effects. In addition to experiencing loneliness, depression, and adjustment difficulties (Crick and Bigbee 1998; Crick and Grotpeter 1996; Nansel et al. 2001; Prinstein, Boergers, and Vernberg 2001; Storch et al. 2003), victimized children are more prone to truancy (Ringwalt, Ennett, and Johnson 2003), poor academic performance (MacMillan and Hagan 2004; Wei and Williams 2004), dropping out of school (Beauvais et al. 1996; MacMillan and Hagan 2004), and violent behaviors (Nansel et al. 2003). For teachers, incidents of victimization may lead to professional disenchantment and even departure from the profession altogether (Karcher 2002; Smith and Smith 2006).

For parents, school staff, and policymakers to effectively address school crime, they need an accurate understanding of the extent, nature, and context of the problem. However, it is difficult to gauge the scope of crime and violence in schools given the large amount of attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence. Measuring progress toward safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the current state of school crime and safety across the nation and regularly updating and monitoring these indicators; this is the aim of Indicators of School Crime and Safety. 

Purpose and Organization of This Report
Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011 is the fourteenth in a series of reports produced since 1998 by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) that present the most recent data available on school crime and student safety. The report is not intended to be an exhaustive compilation of school crime and safety information, nor does it attempt to explore reasons for crime and violence in schools. Rather, it is designed to provide a brief summary of information from an array of data sources and to make data on national school crime and safety accessible to policymakers, educators, parents, and the general public.

Indicators of School Crime and Safety: 2011 is organized into sections that delineate specific concerns to readers, starting with a description of the most serious violent crimes. The sections cover Violent Deaths; Nonfatal Student and Teacher Victimization; School Environment; Fights, Weapons, and Illegal Substances; Fear and Avoidance; and Discipline, Safety, and Security Measures. Each section contains a set of indicators that, taken together, aim to describe a distinct aspect of school crime and safety. Where available, data on crimes that occur outside of school grounds are offered as a point of comparison.1 Supplemental tables for each indicator provide more detailed breakouts and standard errors for estimates. Standard errors for the estimate tables are available online. A glossary of terms and a reference section appear at the end of the report. 

This year’s report contains updated data for thirteen indicators: violent deaths at school and away from school (Indicator 1), incidence of victimization at school and away from school (Indicator 2), prevalence of victimization at school (Indicator 3), violent and other crime incidents at public schools and those reported to the police (Indicator 6), discipline problems reported by public schools (Indicator 7), students’ reports of gangs at school (Indicator 8), students’ reports of being called hate-related words and seeing hate-related graffiti (Indicator 10), bullying at school and cyber-bullying anywhere (Indicator 11), students’ perceptions of personal safety at school and away from school (Indicator 17), students’ reports of avoiding school activities or specific places in school (Indicator 18), serious disciplinary actions taken by public schools (Indicator 19), safety and security measures taken by public schools (Indicator 20), and students’ reports of safety and security measures observed at school (Indicator 21). 

Also found in this year’s report are references to recent publications relevant to each indicator that the reader may want to consult for additional information or analyses. These references can be found in the “For more information” sidebars at the bottom of each indicator. 

Data
The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, and principals and universe data collections from federal departments and agencies, including BJS, NCES, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design, or is the result of a universe data collection. 

The combination of multiple, independent sources of data provides a broad perspective on school crime and safety that could not be achieved through any single source of information. However, readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. While every effort has been made to keep key definitions consistent across indicators, differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, both Indicators 20 and 21 report data on selected security and safety measures used in schools. Indicator 20 uses data collected from a survey of public school principals about safety and security practices used in their schools during the 2009–10 school year. The schools range from primary through high schools. Indicator 21, however, uses data collected from 12- through 18-year-old students residing in a sample of households. These students were asked whether they observed selected safety and security measures in their school in 2009, but they may not have known whether, in fact, the security measure was present. In addition, different indicators contain various approaches to the analysis of school crime data and, therefore, will show different perspectives on school crime. For example, both Indicators 2 and 3 report data on theft and violent crime at school based on the National Crime Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement to that survey, respectively. While Indicator 2 examines the number of incidents of crime, Indicator 3 examines the percentage or prevalence of students who reported victimization. Table A provides a summary of some of the variations in the design and coverage of sample surveys used in this report.

Several indicators in this report are based on self-reported survey data. Readers should note that limitations inherent to self-reported data may affect estimates (Addington 2005; Cantor and Lynch 2000). First, unless an interview is “bounded” or a reference period is established, estimates may include events that exceed the scope of the specified reference period. This factor may artificially increase reported incidents because respondents may recall events outside of the given reference period. Second, many of the surveys rely on the respondent to “self-determine” a condition. This factor allows the respondent to define a situation based upon his or her own interpretation of whether the incident was a crime or not. On the other hand, the same situation may not necessarily be interpreted in the same way by a bystander or the perceived offender. Third, victim surveys tend to emphasize crime events as incidents that take place at one point in time. However, victims can often experience a state of victimization in which they are threatened or victimized regularly or repeatedly. Finally, respondents may recall an event inaccurately. For instance, people may forget the event entirely or recall the specifics of the episode incorrectly. These and other factors may affect the precision of the estimates based on these surveys.

Data trends are discussed in this report when possible. Where trends are not discussed, either the data are not available in earlier surveys or the wording of the survey question changed from year to year, eliminating the ability to discuss any trend. 

Where data from samples are reported, as is the case with most of the indicators in this report, the standard error is calculated for each estimate provided in order to determine the “margin of error” for these estimates. The standard errors of the estimates for different subpopulations in an indicator can vary considerably and should be taken into account when making comparisons. With the exception of Indicator 2, in this report, in cases where the standard error was at least 30 percent of the associated estimate, the estimates were noted with a “!” symbol (Interpret data with caution. The coefficient of variation (CV) for this estimate is 30 percent or greater). In Indicator 2, the “!” symbol cautions the reader that estimates marked indicate that the reported statistic was based on fewer than 10 cases. With the exception of Indicator 2, in cases where the standard error was greater than 50 percent of the associated estimate, the estimate was suppressed (Reporting standards not met. Either there are too few cases or the coefficient of variation (CV) is 50 percent or greater). See appendix A for more information.

The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically significant at the .05 level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student’s t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Linear trend tests were used when differences among percentages were examined relative to interval categories of a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students who reported using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with age. When differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordinal categories (such as grade), analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables.

Although percentages reported in the tables are generally rounded to one decimal place (e.g., 76.5 percent), percentages reported in the text and figures are generally rounded from the original number to whole numbers (with any value of 0.50 or above rounded to the next highest whole number). While the data labels on the figures have been rounded to whole numbers, the graphical presentation of these data is based on the unrounded estimates shown in the corresponding table.

Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the datasets used in this report and a discussion of how standard errors were calculated for each estimate.

1 Data in this report are not adjusted to reflect the number of hours that youths spend on school property versus the number of hours they spend elsewhere.


Indicator 1
Violent Deaths at School and Away From School

Over all available survey years, the percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than 2 percent of the total number of youth homicides, and the percentage of youth suicides occurring at school remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides. 

Violent deaths at schools are rare but tragic events with far-reaching effects on the school population and surrounding community. In this indicator, data on school-associated violent deaths are collected using the School Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD). The most recent data collected for this survey cover the time period from July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010. During this time period, there were 33 school-associated violent deaths in elementary and secondary schools in the United States (figure 1.1 and tables 1.1 and 1.2). A school-associated violent death is defined as “a homicide, suicide, or legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States.” Victims of school-associated violent deaths include not only students and staff members, but also others who are not students or staff members, such as parents. School-associated violent deaths include those that occurred while the victim was on the way to or returning from regular sessions at school or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Of the 33 student, staff, and nonstudent school-associated violent deaths occurring between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010, 25 were homicides, 5 were suicides, and 3 were legal interventions2 (table 1.2). Data for school-associated violent deaths for the 2009–10 school year are preliminary.

Data on homicides and suicides at-school and away-from-school were drawn from a number of sources. The ‘away-from-school’ data were included in order to compare ‘at-school’ and ‘away from school’. The availability for data on homicides and data on suicides at-school and away-from-school differs in time period. The most recent data available for total suicides of school-age youth only (youth ages 5–18) are for the 2008 calendar year; the most recent data available for total homicides of youth ages 5–18 are for the 2008–09 school year.3 During 2008–09, there were 1,579 homicides of youth ages 5–18 (figure 1.2 and table 1.1). During the 2008 calendar year, there were 1,344 suicides of youth ages 5–18. From July 1, 2009, through June 30, 2010, there were 17 homicides and 1 suicide of school-age youth at school (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). During the 2009–10 school year, there was approximately one homicide or suicide of a school-age youth at school per 2.7 million students enrolled.4

The percentage of youth homicides occurring at school remained at less than 2 percent of the total number of youth homicides over all available survey years, even though the absolute number of homicides of school-age youth at school varied to some degree across the years (figure 1.1 and table 1.1). Between the 1992–93 and 2009–10 school years, from 1 to 10 school-age youth committed suicide at school each year, with no consistent pattern of increase or decrease in the number of suicides. The percentage of youth suicides occurring at school remained at less than 1 percent of the total number of youth suicides over all available survey years.

2 A death that occurred where the decedent was fatally injured by a law enforcement officer or other peace officer (persons with specified legal authority to use deadly force), acting in the line of duty.
3 Data on total suicides are available only by calendar year, whereas data on suicides and homicides at school and data on total homicides are available by school year. Due to these differences in reference periods, please use caution when comparing violent deaths at school to total violent deaths. Data for total suicides (2009) and total homicides (2009–10) are not yet available.
4 The total number of students enrolled in prekindergarten through 12th grade during the 2009–10 school year was 49,373,307 (Snyder and Dillow 2011).


Indicator 2
Incidence of Victimization at School and Away From School

Between 2009 and 2010, the violent victimization rate for students ages 12–18 at school declined from 20 per 1,000 students to 14 per 1,000 students.

Theft and violence both at school and while going to and from school can affect the overall health and well-being of adolescents, interfere with educational goals, and stall normal healthy development (Fredland 2008). This type of victimization can also lead to higher-than-average rates of teacher turnover, increases in student dropout rates, students changing schools, principals and teachers retiring early, increases in student fear of violence at school, and a decline in learning (Crews, Crews, and Turner 2008). 

In 2010, data from the National Crime Victimization Survey showed that more victimizations were committed against students ages 12–18 at school than away from school. Students ages 12–18 experienced about 828,400 nonfatal victimizations (theft  and violent crime ) at school,  compared to about 652,500 nonfatal victimizations away from school (table 2.1).  These figures represent total crime victimization rates of 32 crimes per 1,000 students at school and 26 victimizations per 1,000 students away from school.

For most years between 1992 and 2008, the rate of theft at school among students ages 12–18 was higher than the rate of theft away from school, but there were no measurable differences between these rates in either 2009 or 2010. Between 1992 and 2000, the rate of violent victimization per 1,000 students away from school was higher than the rate at school. In most years since 2001, the rates of violent victimization per 1,000 students away from school have not been measurably different than the rates at school. However, in 2009 the rate of violent victimization per 1,000 students at school was higher than the rate for students away from school. In 2010, there was no measurable difference in the violent victimization rates at and away from school (11 per 1,000 students away from school and 14 per 1,000 at school).  

Rates of serious violent victimization against students ages 12–18 at school were generally lower than those occurring away from school in each survey year between 1992 and 2008; in both 2009 and 2010, there were no measurable differences in the rates. In 2010, students experienced 4 serious violent victimizations per 1,000 students at school and 5 serious violent victimizations per 1,000 students away from school.

Between 1992 and 2010, the total victimization rates for students ages 12–18 generally declined both at and away from school. This pattern also held for thefts, violent victimizations, and serious violent victimizations (figure 2.1). 

In the most recent period between 2009 and 2010, the total victimization rate against students ages 12–18 at school declined from 43 victimizations per 1,000 students to 32 per 1,000, and the rate of violent victimization at school declined from 20 per 1,000 students to 14 per 1,000. There were no measurable differences in the rates of theft and serious violent victimization against students at school between 2009 and 2010. Away from school, total victimization rates declined from 33 per 1,000 students in 2009 to 26 per 1,000 in 2010.  Theft declined from 19 per 1,000 students in 2009 to 15 per 1,000 in 2010. Violent and serious violent victimization rates away from school were not measurably different between 2009 and 2010.

The victimization rates for students in 2010 varied according to student characteristics. No measurable differences were found by age group (i.e., students ages 12–14 vs. students ages 15–18) in the rates of total victimization, theft, and serious violent victimization at school (figure 2.2 and table 2.2). However, the rates of violent victimization at school were higher for younger students (ages 12–14) than for older students (ages 15–18) (figure 2.2 and table 2.2). Violent victimization rates at school were 18 per 1,000 students ages 12–14, compared to 11 per 1,000 students ages 15–18.  

Away from school, the rates of total victimization and theft were lower for younger students (ages 12–14) than for older students (ages 15–18) (figure 2.2 and table 2.3). Total victimization rates away from school were 20 per 1,000 students ages 12–14, compared to 31 per 1,000 students ages 15–18.  Theft victimization rates away from school were 10 per 1,000 students ages 12–14, compared to 19 per 1,000 students ages 15–18. There were no measurable differences by age group in the rates of violent and serious violent victimization away from school.  

No measurable differences were detected by sex between the rates of total victimization, theft, and serious violent victimizations either at or away from school. Females had lower rates of violent victimization (8 per 1,000) than males (14 per 1,000) away from school in 2010.  There were no measurable differences between male and female rates of violent victimization at school in 2010.  

Students residing in urban and suburban areas had higher rates of violent victimization at school than those residing in rural areas. Violent victimization rates were 18 per 1,000 students in urban areas and 14 per 1,000 in suburban areas, compared to 7 per 1,000 students residing in rural areas.

5 Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A.
6 “Theft” includes attempted and completed pursesnatching, completed pickpocketing, and all attempted and completed thefts, excluding motor vehicle theft. Theft does not include robbery, in which the threat or use of force is involved.
7 “Violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes and simple assault.
8 “At school” includes inside the school building, on school property, or on the way to or from school.
9 “Students” refers to youth ages 12–18 whose educational attainment did not exceed grade 12 at the time of the survey. An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have attended school during the survey reference period. These data do not take into account the number of hours that students spend at school or away from school.
10 “Serious violent victimization” includes rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.

Indicator 3
Prevalence of Victimization at School 

In 2009, approximately 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months. Three percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization, and less than 1 percent reported serious violent victimization.

The School Crime Supplement11 collects data on the percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported criminal victimization at school12 during the previous 6 months. In addition to the total percentages reported by students, victimization is also reported by type, namely theft,13 violent victimization,14 and serious violent victimization.15 Results from the most recent data collection show that in 2009, approximately 4 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months. Three percent of students reported theft, 1 percent reported violent victimization, and less than 1 percent reported serious violent victimization (figure 3.1 and table 3.1).

Reports on the prevalence of victimization varied in 2009 by student characteristics. Among students ages 12–18, a higher percentage of male students (5 percent) than female students (3 percent) reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months. While a higher percentage of male students reported theft (3 percent compared to 2 percent of female students), no measurable differences were detected by sex in the percentages reported by students for violent type of victimization in 2009. 

There were no measurable differences between the percentages of White, Black, and Hispanic students ages 12–18 who reported criminal victimization, theft, and violent victimization at school in 2009. About 4 percent each of White, Black, and Hispanic students reported criminal victimization at school and 3 percent each reported theft. Two percent of Black students and 1 percent each of White and Hispanic students ages 12–18 reported violent victimization.

A higher percentage of 11th-graders (5 percent) than 12th-graders (2 percent) reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months in 2009. Three percent of 7th-graders, 4 percent each of 6th-graders, 8th-graders, and 10th-graders, and 5 percent of 9th-graders reported being victimized at school. A lower percentage of 8th-graders than 9th-graders (2 percent vs. 5 percent) reported theft, and a lower percentage of 12th-graders than 11th-graders (2 percent vs. 
3 percent) reported theft in 2009. 

No measurable differences were observed by urbanicity in 2009 in the prevalence of victimization. About 4 percent each of students ages 12–18 from urban and suburban schools and 3 percent of students from rural schools reported criminal victimization at school. Differences were observed by school type in the prevalence of victimization reported in 2009. Students attending public schools reported being victimized at about twice the rate of students attending private schools (4 percent vs. 2 percent).

Between 1995 and 2009, the total percentage of students ages 12–18 who reported being victimized at school during the previous 6 months, as well as the percentages of students who reported theft, violent victimization, and serious violent victimization, decreased. A decrease between 1995 and 2009 in the percentage of students reporting criminal victimization also occurred by some student and school characteristics. For example, the percentage of male students who reported being victimized at school decreased by about half, from 10 percent in 1995 to 5 percent in 2009. Among female students, the percentage who reported being victimized decreased by about two thirds, from 9 percent in 1995 to 3 percent in 2009. For students attending both public and private schools, the percentages of students who reported victimization decreased. Ten percent of public school students reported being victimized at school in 1995, compared with 4 percent of public school students in 2009. Similarly, about 7 percent of private school students reported being victimized in 1995, compared with 2 percent in 2009.

11 Although Indicators 2 and 3 present information on similar topics, the survey sources for these two indicators differ with respect to time coverage and administration. For more information on these two surveys, please see appendix A.
12 “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school.
13 “Theft” includes purse-snatching, pickpocketing, all burglaries, attempted forcible entry, and all attempted and completed thefts except motor vehicle thefts. Theft does not include robbery in which threat or use of force is involved.
14 “Violent victimization” includes serious violent crimes and simple assault.
15 “Serious violent victimization” includes rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault.


Indicator 4
Threats and Injuries With Weapons on School Property

From 1993 through 2009, the percentage of students who were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property fluctuated between 7 and 9 percent. 

Every year, some students are threatened or injured with a weapon while they are on school property. The percentage of students victimized in this way provides a measure of how safe our schools are, and if levels of safety in school have changed over time. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked whether and how often they had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property16 during the 12 months preceding the survey. From 1993 through 2009, the percentage of students who were threatened or injured with a weapon fluctuated between 7 and 9 percent. For example, in 2009, 8 percent of students reported being threatened or injured with a weapon, such as a gun, knife, or club, on school property (table 4.1). Specifically, 3 percent of students were threatened or injured with a weapon one time, 2 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon two or three times, 1 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon four to eleven times, and 1 percent were threatened or injured with a weapon twelve or more times17 (figure 4.3 and table 4.2).

The likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property varied by student characteristics, including sex and grade level. In each survey year, a higher percentage of males than females reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property (table 4.1). In 2009, the percentage of male students who reported being threatened or injured in the past year was nearly twice as high as the percentage of female students (10 and 5 percent, respectively). Generally, the percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property decreased with grade level (figure 4.1 and table 4.1). For example, in 2009, a smaller percentage of 12th-graders (5 percent) reported that they were threatened or injured with a weapon on school property than the percentages of 9th-, 10th-, and 11th-graders (9, 8, and 8 percent, respectively). 

The percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property varied by race/ethnicity in 2009 (figure 4.2 and table 4.1). Specifically, smaller percentages of White students and Asian students (6 and 5 percent, respectively) than American Indian/Alaska Native students (16 percent), and Black students and Hispanic students (9 percent each) reported being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property. The percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students who reported being threatened or injured with a weapon was higher than the percentages of Black students, Hispanic students, and students of two or more races (9 percent). In addition, higher percentages of Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students and students of two or more races (13 and 9 percent, respectively) than Asian students reported being threatened or injured with a weapon.

In 2009, the percentage of students being threatened or injured with a weapon on school property varied among the 39 states for which data were available. Among these states, the percentage of students who reported being threatened or injured on school property ranged from 6 percent in Indiana, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Vermont to 12 percent in Arkansas (table 4.3).

16 “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.
17 Subtotals do not add to total due to rounding.


Indicator 5
Teachers Threatened With Injury or Physically Attacked by Students 

A greater percentage of teachers in city schools than teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported being threatened with injury during the 2007–08 school year.

Students are not the only victims of intimidation or violence in schools. Teachers are also subject to threats and physical attacks, and students from their schools sometimes commit these offenses. In the Schools and Staffing Survey, teachers were asked whether they had been threatened with injury or physically attacked by a student from their school in the previous 12 months. During the 2007–08 school year, a smaller percentage of teachers, 7 percent, were threatened with injury by a student from their school than in 1993–94 (12 percent) and 1999–2000 (9 percent), though this percentage was not measurably different from the percentage in 2003–04 (7 percent) (figure 5.1 and table 5.1). The percentage of teachers reporting that they had been physically attacked by a student from their school, 4 percent, was not measurably different in 2007–08 than in any previous survey year (table 5.2).

A greater percentage of teachers in city schools than teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported being threatened with injury during the 2007–08 school year (figure 5.2 and table 5.1). Ten percent of teachers in city schools were threatened with injury by students, compared to 7 percent of teachers in town schools and 6 percent each of teachers in suburban and rural schools. A greater percentage of teachers in city schools (5 percent) and suburban schools (4 percent) than teachers in rural schools (3 percent) reported being physically attacked (table 5.2).

During 2007–08, teachers’ reports of being threatened or physically attacked by students varied according to the instructional level of their school. A greater percentage of secondary school teachers (8 percent) than elementary school teachers (7 percent) reported being threatened with injury by a student, and this pattern held for teachers in suburban schools as well as for teachers in rural schools (table 5.1 and figure 5.2). The apparent difference in the percentage of elementary and secondary teachers in city schools who reported being threatened with injury was not statistically significant. However, a greater percentage of elementary school teachers (6 percent) reported having been physically attacked than secondary school teachers (2 percent), and this pattern held true for teachers in city, suburban, town, and rural schools (table 5.2). 

A greater percentage of public than private school teachers reported being threatened with injury (8 vs. 3 percent) or physically attacked (4 vs. 2 percent) by students during 2007–08 (tables 5.1 and 5.2). Among teachers in city schools, there were at least five times as many public school teachers as private school teachers who reported being threatened with injury (12 vs. 2 percent) and at least four times as many public school teachers as private school teachers who reported being physically attacked (6 vs. 1 percent).

In all survey years, a greater percentage of male teachers reported having been threatened with injury than female teachers (table 5.1). For example, in 2007–08, 9 percent of male teachers reported that they were threatened with injury by students, compared to 7 percent of female teachers; this pattern held true for teachers in city and suburban schools in 2007–08, as well. 

Public school teachers’ reports of being threatened with injury or physically attacked varied among the states and the District of Columbia. During 2007–08, the percentage of public school teachers who reported being threatened with injury during the previous 12 months ranged from 3 percent in North Dakota to 17 percent in the District of Columbia (table 5.3), and the percentage who reported being physically attacked ranged from 2 percent in New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, and Ohio to 8 percent in Maryland (table 5.4).


Indicator 6
Violent and Other Crime Incidents at Public Schools, and Those Reported to the Police 

In 2009–10, about 74 percent of public schools recorded one or more violent incidents, 16 percent recorded one or more serious violent incidents, and 44 percent recorded one or more thefts.

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked to provide the number of violent incidents,18 serious violent incidents,19 thefts of items valued at $10 or greater without personal confrontation, and other incidents20 that occurred at their school.21 Public school principals were also asked to provide the number of incidents they reported to the police. This indicator presents the percentage of public schools that recorded one or more of these specified crimes, the total number of these crimes recorded, and the rate of crimes per 1,000 students. These data are also presented for crimes that were reported to the police. 

In all survey years the percentage of public schools that recorded incidents of crime was between 85 and 86 percent, with the exception of school year 2003–04. In 2003–04, the percentage of public schools that recorded incidents of crime was 89 percent. Similarly, the percentage of public schools that reported incidents of crime to the police was between 60 and 62 percent in all survey years with the exception of 2003–04, when 65 percent of public schools reported one or more incidents to the police.

For the majority of types of crime, the percentages of public schools recording incidents of crime or reporting incidents of crime to the police in 2009–10 were not measurably different from the percentages of schools doing so in 2007–08. However, the percentage of schools that recorded vandalism decreased from 49 percent in 2007–08 to 46 percent in 2009–10.

During the 2009–10 school year, 85 percent of public schools recorded that one or more of these incidents of violence, theft, or other crimes had taken place, amounting to an estimated 1.9 million crimes (figure 6.1 and table 6.1). This figure translates to a rate of approximately 40 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled in 2009–10. During the same year, 60 percent of schools reported one of the specified crimes to the police, amounting to about 689,000 crimes—or 15 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled. 

In 2009–10, a greater percentage of schools recorded an incident of crime than reported an incident of crime to the police. This pattern held true for violent crimes, serious violent crimes, thefts, and other crimes. Seventy-four percent of schools recorded one or more violent incidents of crime (a rate of 25 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled), 16 percent recorded one or more serious violent incidents (a rate of 1 crime per 1,000 students enrolled), 44 percent recorded one or more thefts (a rate of 5 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled), and 68 percent recorded one or more other incidents (a rate of 9 crimes per 1,000 students enrolled). In comparison, 40 percent of public schools reported at least one violent incident to police (a rate of 6 reported crimes per 1,000 students), 10 percent reported at least one serious violent incident to police (a rate of less than 1 percent reported crimes per 1,000 students), 25 percent reported at least one theft to police (a rate of 3 reported crimes per 1,000 students), and 46 percent reported one or more other incidents to police (a rate of 6 reported crimes per 1,000 students).

The percentage of schools that recorded incidents of violent crime, serious violent crime, theft, and other incidents varied by school characteristics. For example, by school level, primary schools recorded lower percentages of these types of crimes than middle schools and high schools: 64 percent of primary schools recorded violent incidents of crime compared with 91 percent each of middle schools and high schools (figure 6.2 and table 6.2). A lower percentage of primary schools recorded serious violent incidents of crime (13 percent) than middle or high schools (19 percent and 28 percent, respectively), a lower percentage of primary schools recorded incidents of theft (26 percent) than middle or high schools (65 percent and 83 percent), and a lower percentage of primary schools recorded other incidents (57 percent) than middle or high schools (82 percent and 92 percent).  

A similar pattern was observed for public schools that reported such incidents of violent crime, serious violent crime, theft, and other incidents to the police. The percentages of primary schools that reported incidents of these types of crime to the police were lower than for middle schools and high schools (figure 6.2 and table 6.3). 

Data on the number of crimes recorded and reported by schools in 2009–10 were categorized by frequency range as well. For example, 26 percent of schools recorded zero violent crimes, and 19 percent of schools recorded 20 or more violent crimes (figure 6.3 and table 6.4). Sixty percent of schools did not report a violent crime to the police, while 5 percent of schools reported 20 or more violent crimes to the police. With regard to serious violent crimes, 84 percent of schools did not record a serious violent crime, and 2 percent of schools recorded 10 or more such crimes. Ninety percent of schools did not report a serious violent crime to the police, and 1 percent of schools reported 10 or more serious violent crimes to the police (table 6.5). The number of crimes recorded by schools by frequency range varied by school characteristics. A larger percentage of city schools recorded 20 or more violent incidents in 2009–10 than suburban schools or rural schools (table 6.4). In 2009–10, this amounts to about 25 percent of city schools recording 20 or more violent incidents, compared with 19 percent of suburban schools and 14 percent of rural schools.

18 “Violent incidents” include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of physical attack with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.
19 “Serious violent incidents” include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon.
20 “Other incidents” include possession of a firearm or explosive device; possession of a knife or sharp object; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs or alcohol; vandalism; and inappropriate distribution, possession, or use of prescription drugs.
21 “At school” was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours, or when school activities or events were in session.


Indicator 7
Discipline Problems Reported by Public Schools 

During the 2009–10 school year, 23 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a daily or weekly basis, 9 percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse on a daily or  weekly basis, and 5 percent reported that student verbal abuse of teachers occurred on a daily or weekly basis. Sixteen percent reported gang activities during the school year.

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked how often certain disciplinary problems happened in their schools.22 This indicator examines the daily or weekly occurrence of student racial/ethnic tensions, bullying, sexual harassment of other students, sexual harassment of other students based on sexual orientation or gender identity, verbal abuse of teachers, acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse, and widespread disorder in the classroom. It also looks at occurrences of gang and cult or extremist group activities during the school year. In the 2009–10 survey administration, schools were also asked to report selected types of cyber-bullying problems at school or away from school that occurred daily or weekly. 

During the 2009–10 school year, 23 percent of public schools reported that bullying occurred among students on a daily or weekly basis, and 9 percent reported student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse on a daily or weekly basis (table 7.1). With regard to other discipline problems reported as occurring at least once a week, 5 percent of schools reported student verbal abuse of teachers, and 3 percent each of reported student racial/ethnic tensions, student sexual harassment of other students, sexual harassment of other students based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and widespread disorder in classrooms. Sixteen percent of public schools reported that gang activities had happened at all during the 2009–10 school year and 2 percent reported that cult or extremist activities had happened at all during this period.

Discipline problems reported by public schools varied by school characteristics. In 2009–10, a higher percentage of city schools than rural schools and suburban schools reported various types of discipline problems (figure 7.1 and table 7.1). For example, 27 percent of city schools, compared with 21 percent of rural schools and 20 percent of suburban schools, reported that student bullying occurred at least once a week. A greater percentage of city schools (28 percent) than suburban schools and rural schools (15 percent and 9 percent, respectively) reported any occurrence of gang activities during the school year.

In 2009–10, the percentage of middle schools reporting student racial and ethnic tension (5 percent) was higher than the percentage of high schools (3 percent) and primary schools (2 percent) that reported student racial and ethnic tension (table 7.1). Schools with an enrollment size of 1,000 or more reported higher percentages of student racial and ethnic tension (6 percent) than schools with an enrollment size of 500–999 or 300–499 (3 percent each). 

In addition, 10 percent of schools where 76 percent or more of the students were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch reported the daily or weekly occurrence of student verbal abuse of teachers, compared to 1 percent of schools where 25 percent or less of the students were eligible.23  

The percentages of public schools that reported the occurrence of student bullying, student verbal abuse of teachers, and student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse were greater in 1999–2000 than in 2009–10. For example, in 1999–2000, approximately 29 percent of public schools reported student bullying, compared with 23 percent of public schools that reported student bullying in 2009–10.

Eleven percent of schools reported that student acts of disrespect for teachers other than verbal abuse occurred at least once a week in 2007–08, higher than the 9 percent in 2009–10 (table 7.2). The percentage of public schools that reported widespread disorder in the classrooms decreased from 4 percent in 2007–08 to 3 percent in 2009–10. The percentages of public schools that reported gang activity at all at their schools during the school year decreased from 20 percent in 2007–08 to 16 percent in 2009–10 (table 7.2). 

In 2009–10 the School Survey on Crime and Safety included a questionnaire item on cyber-bullying in which public schools were asked to report the occurrence of cyber-bullying among students at school and away from school.24 Eight percent of public schools reported that cyber-bullying had occurred among students daily or at least once a week at school or away from school. Four percent each of public schools also reported that the school environment was affected by cyber-bullying and that staff resources were used to deal with cyber-bullying (table 7.3).

Public schools’ reports on the occurrence of cyber-bullying at school and away from school in 2009–10 varied by school characteristics (table 7.3). Primary schools reported lower percentages of cyber-bullying among students (2 percent) than middle schools (19 percent), high schools (18 percent), and combined schools (13 percent). Thirteen percent of schools with less than 5 percent combined enrollment of Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native students reported cyber-bullying among students, compared with 5 percent of schools with 50 percent or more combined enrollment.

22 “At school” was defined for respondents to include activities that happen in school buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that hold school-sponsored events or activities. Respondents were instructed to include incidents that occurred before, during, or after normal school hours or when school activities or events were in session.
23 The percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch programs is a proxy measure of school poverty.
24 “Cyber-bullying” was defined for respondents as “occurring when willful and repeated harm is inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, or other electronic devices.”


Indicator 8
Students’ Reports of Gangs at School

In 2009, about 20 percent of students reported that gangs were present at their school. A higher percentage of students from urban schools (31 percent) reported a gang presence than students from suburban (17 percent) and rural schools (16 percent). 

The presence of gang activity in the vicinity of schools poses a risk to staff and student safety and school security. Intimidation of staff and students by gang members has a large impact on the educational environment and perception of school safety (Smith 2011).  The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey asked students ages 12–18 if gangs were present at their school during the school year.25

In 2009, about 20 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that gangs were present at their school during the school year. This was a decrease from the 23 percent of students who reported a gang presence in 2007. A higher percentage of students from urban schools (31 percent) reported a gang presence at their school in 2009 than students from suburban and rural schools (17 percent and 16 percent, respectively). While the percentage of students from suburban schools who reported a gang presence at their school was lower in 2009 than in 2007 (17 vs. 21 percent), the percentages of students from urban and rural schools who reported a gang presence were not measurably different between the same years (figure 8.1 and table 8.1). In 2009, approximately 22 percent of students attending public schools reported that gangs were present at their school compared with 2 percent of students attending private schools.

There were no measurable differences in the percentages of male and female students who reported a gang presence at their school in 2009—approximately 21 percent of males and 20 percent of females reported a gang presence during the school year. The percentage of female students who reported such was not measurably different between 2009 and 2007; however, the percentage of male students who reported a gang presence was lower in 2009 than in 2007 (21 vs. 25 percent). 

The percentages of students reporting a gang presence at school varied by their race/ethnicity in 2009. Higher percentages of Hispanic students (33 percent) and Black students (31 percent) than White students (14 percent) and Asian students (17 percent) reported the presence of gangs. 

Students’ reports of a gang presence at their school also varied by grade in 2009 (figure 8.2 and table 8.1). The percentages of students in 6th through 8th grade, for example, who reported a gang presence at their school were lower than the percentages for students in 9th through 12th grade. Eleven percent of 6th-graders reported the presence of gangs, compared with 25 percent of 9th-graders and 28 percent of 10th-graders. The percentage of students in 10th-grade who reported a gang presence at their school was higher than the percentages of students in 11th grade (23 percent) and 12th grade (22 percent) who reported a gang presence.

25 “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school.


Indicator 9
Students’ Reports of Drug Availability on School Property

The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them decreased from 32 percent in 1995 to 23 percent in 2009. 

In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked whether someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in the 12 months before the survey.26 The percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported that drugs were made available to them on school property increased from 1993 to 1995 (from 24 to 32 percent), but subsequently decreased to 23 percent in 2009 (table 9.1). There was no statistically significant difference, however, between the 2009 percentage and the 2007 percentage (22 percent) (table 9.1 and figure 9.1). 

Student reports of the availability of drugs on school property varied by student characteristics. A higher percentage of males than females reported that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property in each survey year from 1993 to 2009 (figure 9.1 and table 9.1). For example, in 2009, 26 percent of males reported that drugs were made available to them, compared to 19 percent of females. There were no measurable differences across grades in the percentages of students reporting that drugs were made available to them in 2009. Twenty-four percent of 10th- and 11th-graders, 22 percent of 9th-graders and 21 percent of 12th-graders reported that drugs were made available to them.  

The percentage of students who reported having illegal drugs offered, sold, or given to them on school property differed across racial/ethnic groups (figure 9.2 and table 9.1). Specifically, in 2009, higher percentages of American Indian/Alaska Native students (34 percent) and Hispanic students (31 percent) than Black students (22 percent), White students (20 percent), and Asian students (18 percent) reported that drugs were made available to them on school property. In addition, a higher percentage of students of two or more races (27 percent) than of Asian students or White students reported that drugs were made available to them on school property.

In 2009, student reports of the availability of drugs on school property varied across the 42 states for which data were available. Among these states, the percentage of students reporting that drugs were offered, sold, or given to them on school property ranged from 15 percent in Kansas to 36 percent in Hawaii and Nevada (table 9.2).

26 “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.


Indicator 10
Students’ Reports of Being Called Hate-Related Words and Seeing Hate-Related Graffiti 

In 2009, about 9 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being targets of hate-related words at school during the school year and 29 percent of students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school.

The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey collects data on students’ reports of being targets of hate-related27 words and seeing hate-related graffiti at school.28 Specifically, in 2009, students ages 12–18 were asked whether someone at school had called them a derogatory word having to do with their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation. Students also were asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at their school—that is, hate-related words or symbols written in classrooms, bathrooms, hallways, or on the outside of the school building. 

In 2009, about 9 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being targets of hate-related words at school and 29 percent of students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year (figure 10.1 and table 10.1). While the percentage of students who reported being targets of hate-related words in 2009 was not measurably different from the percentage who reported so in 2007 (10 percent), the percentage of students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school was smaller in 2009 than in 2007 (35 percent). The percentage of students who reported being targets of hate-related words decreased from 12 percent in 2001 to 9 percent in 2009.

No measurable differences were observed in 2009 in the percentages of males and females who reported being called a hate-related word and seeing hate-related graffiti at school during the school year. The percentages of male and female students ages 12–18 who reported being called a hate-related word during the school year were not measurably different in 2007 (9 percent each) and 2009 (10 percent each). However, the percentages of male and female students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school were lower in 2009 (29 percent each) than in 2007 (34 percent for male students and 35 percent for female students). 

Higher percentages of Black students and Hispanic students (11 percent each) reported being targets of hate-related words at school than White students (7 percent) in 2009. In addition, a higher percentage of Hispanic students (32 percent) than White students (28 percent) reported seeing hate-related graffiti.

Few differences were observed across grade levels in the percentages of students who reported being targets of hate-related words. A lower percentage of 12th-graders (6 percent) reported being targets of hate-related words than 7th-graders and 10th-graders (10 percent each), as well as 8th-graders (11 percent).No measurable differences were observed across grades for students’ reports of seeing hate-related graffiti at school in 2009, nor were there differences by grade in the percentages of students who reported being called a hate-related word between 2007 and 2009. There were differences at some grade levels, however, in the percentages of students who reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school between 2007 and 2009. For example, about 35 percent of 6th-graders reported seeing graffiti in 2007, compared with 28 percent in 2009.

By school sector, the percentage of public school students who reported being called a hate-related word (9 percent) was not measurably different from the percentage reported by private school students (7 percent) in 2009. In each data collection year between 1999 and 2009, a higher percentage of public school students than private school students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school. Specifically, for 2009, approximately 31 percent of public school students reported seeing hate-related graffiti at school compared with 12 percent of private school students. 

Students who were targets of being called hate-related words at school in 2009 were asked to indicate whether the derogatory word they were called was related to their race, ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, or sexual orientation (figure 10.2 and table 10.2). A higher percentage of male students than female students reported being called a hate-related word with regard to their race (5 percent vs. 4 percent). In turn, a higher percentage of female students than male students reported being called a hate-related word with regard to their gender (3 percent vs. 1 percent). 

With respect to being called a hate-related word related to a student’s race or ethnicity, White students reported being targets at a lower percentage than their peers. For example, 2 percent of White students reported being called a hate-related word with regard to their race, compared with 8 percent each of Black and Hispanic students. In addition, 1 percent of White students reported being called a hate-related word with regard to their ethnicity, compared with 4 percent of Black students and 7 percent of Hispanic students.

27 “Hate-related” refers to derogatory terms used by others in reference to students’ personal characteristics.
28 “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school.


Indicator 11
Bullying at School and Cyber-Bullying Anywhere

In 2009, about 28 percent of 12- to 18-year-old students reported having been bullied at school during the school year and 6 percent reported having been cyber-bullied.

Bullying is now recognized as a widespread and often neglected problem in schools that has serious implications for victims of bullying and for those who perpetrate the bullying (Swearer et al. 2010). The School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey collects data on students ages 12–18 and their reports of being bullied at school29 and being cyber-bullied anywhere during the school year. Cyber-bullying is distinct from bullying at school. While data on cyber-bullying are collected separately from data on bullying at school, the context for cyber-bullying may have developed at school. 

This indicator first discusses student reports of being bullied at school in 2009 by selected bullying problems, and selected student and school characteristics. It then discusses student reports of being cyber-bullied anywhere in 2009 by selected cyber-bullying problems, and selected student and school characteristics. In addition, findings on bullying at school over time are presented for 2005, 2007, and 2009. Prior data are excluded from the time series due to significant redesign of the bullying items in 2005.

In 2009, about 28 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being bullied at school during the school year (figure 11.1 and table 11.1).30 Of those students who reported being bullied at school, 19 percent reported that they had been made fun of, called names, or insulted. Sixteen percent of students reported being the subject of rumors, 9 percent said they had been pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on; and 6 percent reported being threatened with harm. Five percent of students reported being excluded from activities on purpose, 4 percent reported that others had tried to make them do things they did not want to do, and 3 percent reported that their property had been destroyed by others on purpose. In 2009, 22 percent of students who had been pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on at school during the school year, reported being injured. 

Students’ reports of being bullied at school varied by student and school characteristics. In 2009, a higher percentage of females (20 percent) than males (13 percent) ages 12–18 reported being the subject of rumors, while a lower percentage of females (8 percent) than males (10 percent) reported being pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on. In addition, a higher percentage of females (6 percent) than males (4 percent) also reported being excluded from activities on purpose.

The percentages of students who reported being bullied or being subjects of selected bullying problems were lower for Asian students than for White, Black, or Hispanic students in 2009. For example, 17 percent of Asian students ages 12–18 reported being bullied at school during the school year, compared with 29 percent each of White and Black students and 26 percent of Hispanic students. Approximately 10 percent of Asian students reported being made fun of, called names, or insulted, compared with 21 percent of White students, 18 percent of Black students, and 16 percent of Hispanic students.

A higher percentage of 6th-graders than students in grades 8 through 12 reported being bullied at school during the school year. The percentages reported by 6th-graders and 7th-graders were not measurably different. In 2009, about 39 percent of 6th-graders reported being bullied at school, compared with 33 percent of 7th-graders, 32 percent of 8th-graders, 28 percent of 9th-graders, 27 percent of 10th-graders, 21 percent of 11th-graders, and 20 percent of 12th-graders. By school sector, a higher percentage of public school students (29 percent) than private school students (19 percent) reported being bullied at school during the school year.

The School Crime Supplement asked students ages 12–18 who reported being bullied at school to indicate the location in which they had been victimized. In 2009, about 48 percent of students reported being bullied by another student in the hallway or stairwell at school during the school year (figure 11.3 and table 11.2). In addition, 34 percent reported being bullied inside the classroom, and 24 percent reported being bullied outside on school grounds. Nine percent were bullied in the bathroom or lockerroom, 7 percent were bullied in the cafeteria, 6 percent of students reported being bullied on the school bus, and 3 percent were bullied somewhere else in school. 

Of students who were bullied in 2009, a higher percentage of females (52 percent) than males (44 percent) reported being bullied in the hallway or stairwell, and a lower percentage of females (21 percent) than males (27 percent) reported being bullied outside on school grounds. A higher percentage of public school students than private school students (49 vs. 36 percent) reported being bullied in the hallway or stairwell during the school year, and a lower percentage of public school students than private school students (23 vs. 37 percent) reported being bullied outside on school grounds. In addition, a higher percentage of students from rural schools (56 percent) reported being bullied in the hallway or stairwell than students from urban schools (47 percent) and suburban schools (46 percent) and a higher percentage of students from urban schools (30 percent) than students from suburban schools (23 percent) and rural schools (18 percent) reported being bullied outside on school grounds.

In 2009, approximately 6 percent of students ages 12–18 reported being cyber-bullied31 anywhere during the school year (figure 11.2 and table 11.3). Three percent reported being subject to harassing text messages. Two percent of students reported that another student had posted hurtful information on the Internet and 2 percent reported that they had been subject to harassing instant messaging. Students also reported being the subject of harassing emails, being excluded on-line, and being harassed while gaming (1 percent each). 

With the exception of being the subject of harassment while gaming and being excluded on-line, females reported being cyber-bullied at higher percentages than males for each type of cyber-bullying problem. For example, among students ages 12–18 in 2009, about 4 percent of females reported being subject to harassing text messages compared with 2 percent of males.

Among those students who were bullied at school or cyber-bullied anywhere, there generally were no measurable differences between males and females in the frequency in which they were bullied. Students also were asked to report if they had notified an adult about the perpetration (figure 11.4 and table 11.4). While there was no measurable difference by sex in students notifying an adult after being bullied at school, a higher percentage of females (38 percent) than males (23 percent) reported notifying an adult after being cyber-bullied.

Students’ reports of being bullied at school varied over time (figure 11.5 and table 11.5). While no overall pattern was observed between 2005 and 2009, a lower percentage of students reported being bullied in 2005 than in 2007 (28 vs. 32 percent). For most groups of students, the percentages reported by students in 2007 were higher than the percentages reported in 2009, returning percentages to 2005 levels.

For the majority of student and school characteristics, the percentages of students who reported being bullied at school in 2005 were lower than the percentages of students who did so in 2007. For example, 27 percent of male students and 29 percent of female students reported being bullied at school in 2005, compared with 30 percent of male students and 33 percent of female students who reported so in 2007. The percentages of White students and Hispanic students who reported being bullied during the school year in 2005 were lower (30 percent and 22 percent, respectively) than the corresponding percentages in 2007 (34 and 27 percent, respectively).

In 2007, the percent of public school students who reported being bullied at school (32 percent) and the percent of private school students who reported being bullied at school (29 percent) was higher than in 2009, when 29 percent of public school students, and 19 percent of private school students reported being bullied at school. In addition, a lower percentage of students from suburban schools reported being bullied in 2007 than in 2009. Between 2007 and 2009, no measurable differences were detected in the percentages of students from urban or rural schools who reported being bullied.

Indicator 12
Teachers’ Reports on School Conditions

In 2007–08, a greater percentage of public school teachers than private school teachers reported that student misbehavior, student tardiness, and class cutting interfered with their teaching. 

Classroom disruptions are associated with lower student achievement for the offending student, as well as for that student’s classmates (Lannie and McCurdy 2007). In the Schools and Staffing Survey, public and private school teachers were asked if student misbehavior, student tardiness, and class cutting interfered with their teaching. During the 2007–08 school year, 34 percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching, and 32 percent reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching (figure 12.1 and table 12.1). Teachers were also asked whether school rules were enforced by other teachers at their school, even for students not in their classes, and whether they were enforced by the principal. In 2007–08, 72 percent of teachers agreed or strongly agreed that other teachers at their school enforced the school rules, and 89 percent reported that the principal enforced the school rules (figure 12.2 and table 12.2).

The percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior, class cutting, and tardiness interfered with their teaching varied by teacher and school characteristics during 2007–08 (table 12.1). For example, a greater percentage of public school teachers than private school teachers reported that student misbehavior (36 vs. 21 percent) and student tardiness and class cutting (33 vs. 18 percent) interfered with their teaching. And a higher percentage of secondary school teachers than elementary school teachers reported that student misbehavior (39 vs. 33 percent) and student tardiness and class cutting (45 vs. 26 percent) interfered with their teaching.

A greater percentage of teachers in city schools compared to teachers in suburban, town, or rural schools reported that student misbehavior, tardiness, and class cutting interfered with their teaching in 2007–08 (figure 12.1). Forty percent of teachers in city schools, compared to 32 percent of teachers in suburban schools, 34 percent of teachers in town schools, and 31 percent of teachers in rural schools reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching. Thirty-eight percent of teachers in city schools reported that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching, compared to 29 percent of teachers in suburban schools, 32 percent of teachers in town schools, and 27 percent of teachers in rural schools who reported that these occurrences interfered with their teaching.

The percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching fluctuated between 1987–88 and 1993–94; however, between 1993–94 and 2007–08 this percentage decreased (from 41 to 34 percent). The percentage of teachers reporting that student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching decreased between 1987–88 and 1993–94 (from 33 to 25 percent), but increased between 1993–94 and 2007–08 (from 25 to 32 percent). There were no measurable differences in the percentage of teachers reporting that student misbehavior or tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching between the two most recent survey years, 2003–04 and 2007–08.

The percentage of teachers who agreed that school rules were enforced by other teachers and by the principal varied by teacher and school characteristics. In every survey year, a higher percentage of elementary school teachers than secondary school teachers agreed that school rules were enforced by teachers and by the principal in their school (table 12.2). In 2007–08, 79 percent of elementary teachers, compared to 56 percent of secondary teachers reported that school rules were enforced by other teachers, and 89 percent of elementary school teachers, compared to 86 percent of secondary teachers, reported that school rules were enforced by the principal. 

Between 1987–88 and 2007–08, the percentage of teachers who agreed that school rules were enforced by other teachers fluctuated between 65 and 72 percent, and the percentage agreeing that rules were enforced by the principal varied between 84 and 89 percent, showing no consistent trends. There were no measurable differences in the percentage of teachers reporting that school rules were enforced by other teachers or by the principal between the two most recent survey years, 2003–04 and 2007–08. 

In 2007–08, the percentage of public school teachers who agreed or strongly agreed that student misbehavior and student tardiness and class cutting interfered with their teaching and that school rules are enforced by other teachers and by the principal, varied among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. For example, among these states and the District of Columbia, the percentage of teachers who reported that student misbehavior interfered with their teaching ranged from 59 percent of teachers in the District of Columbia to 29 percent of teachers in Pennsylvania (table 12.3).


Indicator 13
Physical Fights on School Property and Anywhere

The percentage of students in grades 9 through 12 who reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased between 1993 and 2009, from 42 to 31 percent; this was also true for the percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight on school property, this percentage decreased from 16 to 11 percent.

Physical fights on school property are considered a high-risk behavior that may disrupt a focused learning environment at school; and students involved in physical fights on school property may face difficulties succeeding in their studies (Payne, Gottfredson, and Gottfredson 2003). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked about their general involvement in physical fights (referred to as “anywhere” in this indicator) during the preceding 12 months, as well as about their involvement in physical fights on school property.32 Fights occurring anywhere are included as a point of comparison with fights occurring on school property. Overall, the percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight anywhere decreased from 42 percent in 1993 to 31 percent in 2009. Similarly, the percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight on school property decreased between 1993 and 2009, from 16 to 11 percent (figure 13.1 and table 13.1). Between the two most recent survey years, 2007 and 2009, the percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported being in a fight anywhere decreased from 36 to 31 percent. There was no measurable difference between these two survey years in the percentage of students who reported being in a fight on school property.

Students were also asked how often they were in physical fights anywhere during the past year. In 2009, 24 percent reported being in a fight one to three times, 5 percent were in a fight four to eleven times, and 3 percent were in a fight twelve or more times. Ten percent of students reported being in a fight on school property one to three times, 1 percent were in a fight on school property four to eleven times, and less than 1 percent were in a fight on school property twelve or more times (table 13.2). 

From 1993 through 2009, the percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight anywhere and on school property decreased for all four grade levels (grades 9 through 12) (figure 13.1 and table 13.1). Generally, a higher percentage of students in 9th grade reported being in fights than students in any other grade, both anywhere and on school property. For example, in 2009, 37 percent of 9th-graders, compared to 33 percent of 10th-graders, 29 percent of 11th-graders, and 25 percent of 12th-graders reported being in a fight anywhere. Similarly, 15 percent of 9th-graders, compared to 12 percent of 10th-graders, 10 percent of 11th-graders, and 7 percent of 12th-graders reported being in a fight on school property in 2009. A smaller percentage of 12th-graders were involved in physical fights anywhere and on school property than any other grade.

The percentage of students who reported being in a physical fight differed by race/ethnicity in 2009 (figure 13.2 and table 13.1). Generally, a smaller percentage of Asian students reported being in physical fights anywhere and on school property than other racial/ethnic groups. In addition, smaller percentages of White students reported being in fights anywhere and on school property than Black, Hispanic, or American Indian/Alaska Native students. For example, 19 percent of Asian students reported being in a physical fight anywhere at least once during the previous 12 months, compared to 28 percent of White students, 36 percent of Hispanic students, 41 percent of Black students, and 42 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students. Eight percent of Asian students reported being in a fight on school property at least once during the previous 12 months, compared to 14 percent of Hispanic students, 17 percent of Black students, and 21 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students.

For both males and females, the percentage of students who reported being in a fight anywhere was lower in 2009 than in 2007 (39 percent compared to 44 percent for males, and 23 percent compared to 27 percent for females). While the percentage of students who reported being in fights on school property in 2009 was lower than in 2007 for females (7 percent compared to 9 percent), there was no measurable difference in the percentage who reported being in fights on school property for males. A greater percentage of males than females reported being in a higher number of physical fights both anywhere and on school property. For example, 4 percent of males reported being in a fight twelve or more times in 2009, compared to 1 percent of females. One percent of males reported being in a fight on school property twelve or more times, compared to less than half a percent of females (figure 13.3 and table 13.2).

Data for 2009 were available for 41 states. Among these states, the percentage of students who reported being in a  fight anywhere ranged from 23 percent in Maine to 37 percent in New Mexico, while the percentage of students reporting being in a fight on school property ranged from 7 percent in North Dakota to 15 percent in Arkansas and New Mexico (table 13.3).

32 “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.


Indicator 14
Students Carrying Weapons on School Property and Anywhere

Between 1993 and 2009, the percentage of students in grades 9–12 who reported carrying a weapon at least one day anywhere during the past 30 days declined from 22 to 17 percent, and the percentage carrying a weapon on school property declined from 12 to 6 percent.

The presence of weapons at school may interfere with teaching and learning by creating an intimidating and threatening atmosphere (Aspy et al. 2004). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students were asked if they had carried a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club in the past 30 days (referred to as ‘anywhere’ in this report) or if they had carried one of these weapons on school property during the same time period.33 Weapon carrying anywhere is included as a point of comparison with weapon carrying on school property. In 2009, 17 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported that they had carried a weapon anywhere on at least one day during the past 30 days: 8 percent carried a weapon anywhere on six or more days of the period, 6 percent carried a weapon on two to five days of the period, and 4 percent carried a weapon on one day of the period (tables 14.1 and 14.2). As for the percentages of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property during the past 30 days, 6 percent of students reported that they had carried a weapon on at least one day of the period. This percentage was composed of 2 percent of students reporting carrying a weapon on school property on six or more days, 1 percent reporting carrying a weapon on two to five days, and 2 percent reporting carrying a weapon on one day.

The percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere in the past 30 days declined from 22 percent in 1993 to 17 percent in 2009. In addition, from 1993 to 2009 the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon on school property declined from 12 to 6 percent. However, the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon either anywhere or on school property was statistically unchanged from 2007 to 2009.

In every survey year, the percentage of males who reported they had carried a weapon, either anywhere or on school property was higher than the percentage of females doing so (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). In 2009, for example, 27 percent of males carried a weapon anywhere, compared to 7 percent of females, and 8 percent of males carried a weapon on school property, compared to 3 percent of females.

The percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere or on school property varied according to students’ race/ethnicity (figure 14.2 and table 14.1). In 2009, a smaller percentage of Asian students (8 percent) than of students from any other racial/ethnic group (the percentages for the other groups ranged from 14 to 21 percent) reported carrying a weapon anywhere during the previous 30 days. In addition, the percentage of White students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere was higher than that of Black students (19 vs. 14 percent). A smaller percentage of Asian students (4 percent) reported carrying a weapon on school property than of Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students (10 percent), White students (6 percent), or Hispanic students (6 percent).

In 2009, the percentages of 9th- through 12th-grade students reporting carrying a weapon anywhere during the past 30 days ranged from 16 to 18 percent, whereas the percentages of 9th- through 12th-graders reporting carrying a weapon on school property during that time period ranged from 5 to 6 percent. However, there were no significant differences in the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere or on school property by grade level.  

State level data were available in 37 states for students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere and in 41 states for students who reported carrying a weapon on school property. In 2009, the percentage of students who reported carrying a weapon anywhere and on school property (varied among the states for which data were available (table 14.3). Among these states, the percentage of students reporting carrying a weapon anywhere ranged from 10 percent in New Jersey and Rhode Island to 27 percent in New Mexico, while the percentage of students reporting carrying a weapon on school property ranged from 3 percent in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to 12 percent in Wyoming.

33 “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.


Indicator 15
Students’ Use of Alcohol on School Property and Anywhere

In 2009, about 42 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported having at least one drink of alcohol anywhere in the past 30 days, while 4 percent had at least one drink on school property.

Alcohol consumption on school property is an illegal behavior of students that may lead to additional crimes and misbehavior (Kodjo, Auinger, and Ryan 2003). In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9–12 were asked whether they had consumed alcohol at all (referred to as “anywhere” in this indicator) during the past 30 days and if they had consumed alcohol on school property.34 In most states, purchase and consumption of alcohol anywhere publicly by students in grades 9–12 (as they are under the legal drinking age of 21) is illegal. Alcohol consumption anywhere is included as a point of comparison with alcohol consumption on school property. Overall, the percentage of students reporting alcohol consumption anywhere in the past 30 days decreased from 48 percent in 1993 to 42 percent in 2009. The percentage of students reporting alcohol consumption on school property in the past 30 days in 2009 was not measurably different from the 1993 percentage (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). 

In 2009, 20 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using alcohol anywhere on one or two days during the past 30 days. Twenty-one percent reported using alcohol anywhere from three to twenty-nine days during the past 30 days, and 1 percent reported using alcohol anywhere all 30 days (table 15.2). In addition, 3 percent of students reported using alcohol on school property on one or two days during the past 30 days, 1 percent of students reported using alcohol on school property from three to twenty-nine days during the past 30 days, and less than one-half percent of students reported using alcohol on school property all 30 days. 

Since 2003, there has been no measurable difference between the percentages of male and female students who reported alcohol consumption anywhere (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). However, there were differences in the reporting of how often alcohol was consumed in 2009. For example, a higher percentage of females than males reported consuming alcohol either one or two days out of the previous 30 days in 2009 (23 percent vs. 18 percent). However, a higher percentage of males than females reported consuming alcohol from three to twenty-nine days (22 percent vs. 19 percent). One percent of male students reported consuming alcohol anywhere all thirty days (figure 15.2 and table 15.2). In every survey year, a greater percentage of males reported using alcohol on school property than females (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). For example, in 2009, 5 percent of males reported consuming alcohol on school property at least one time, whereas 4 percent of females did so. Two percent of male students reported consuming alcohol on school property from three to twenty-nine days in 2009, whereas 1 percent of female students did so (figure 15.2 and table 15.2).

In 2009, about one-half (52 percent) of 12th-graders reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least one time during the previous 30 days (figure 15.3 and table 15.1). This percentage was higher than the 2009 percentage of 9th-graders (32 percent), 10th-graders (41 percent), and 11th-graders (46 percent) who reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least one time during the previous 30 days. There also were differences in how often alcohol was consumed anywhere among the grades in 2009 (table 15.2). For example, a higher percentage of 12th-graders (27 percent) than of 9th-graders (13 percent), 10th-graders (20 percent), and 11th-graders (23 percent) reported consuming alcohol anywhere from three to twenty-nine days in the past 30 days. In terms of alcohol use on school property in 2009, there were no measurable differences in alcohol consumption among the grades.

Alcohol consumption anywhere and on school property also varied by racial/ethnic group. In 2009, a smaller percentage of Asian students (18 percent) than of students of any other racial/ethnic group reported consuming alcohol anywhere (figure 15.4 and table 15.1). In addition, a smaller percentage of Black students (33 percent) than of White students (45 percent) and Hispanic students (43 percent) reported consuming alcohol anywhere at least one time during the previous 30 days. Asian students were less likely to consume alcohol on school property (3 percent) than Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students (10 percent), Hispanic students and students of two or more races (7 percent), and Black students (5 percent); however there was no measurable difference in the alcohol consumption on school property of Asian students and White students (3 percent each). 

State level data were available in 42 states for students who reported drinking alcohol anywhere and in 38 states for students who reported drinking alcohol on school property. The percentage of students who reported drinking alcohol anywhere and on school property varied among the states for which data were available. Among these states, the percentage of students who reported drinking alcohol anywhere at least one day during the previous 30 days ranged from 18 percent in Utah to 47 percent in Louisiana, while the percentage of students who reported drinking on school property ranged from 3 percent in Alaska, Kansas, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, and Vermont to 8 percent in Hawaii and New Mexico (table 15.3).

34 “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.


Indicator 16
Students’ Use of Marijuana on School Property and Anywhere

In 2009, 21 percent of students in grades 9–12 reported using marijuana anywhere at least one time in the past 30 days, while 5 percent reported using marijuana at least one time on school property. 

The Youth Risk Behavior Survey asked students in grades 9–12 whether they had used marijuana at all (referred to as “anywhere” in this indicator) in the past 30 days as well as whether they had used marijuana on school property in the past 30 days.35 According to students’ reports in 2009, students were four times more likely to use marijuana anywhere than on school property. Of students in grades 9–12, twenty-one percent reported using marijuana at least one time anywhere in the past 30 days, while 5 percent reported using marijuana at least one time on school property in the past 30 days (figure 16.1 and table 16.1). 

The percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere at least one time in the past 30 days was higher in 1999 (27 percent) than in 1993 (18 percent). Between 1999 and 2009, the percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere had declined to 21 percent. However, there was no measurable difference between the percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere in 2005 and the percentage who reported using it anywhere in 2009. With regard to marijuana use on school property, the percentage of students who reported using marijuana decreased between 1993 and 2009.  In 1999, 7 percent of students reported using marijuana at least one time during the past 30 days on school property, and by 2009 this percentage had declined to 5 percent (figure 16.1 and table 16.1).

In every survey year, higher percentages of males than females reported using marijuana anywhere and on school property (figure 16.1 and table 16.1). For example, in 2009, 23 percent of males reported using marijuana anywhere during the previous 30 days, compared to 18 percent of females. According to students’ reports, male students were twice as likely as females to use marijuana on school property in 2009 (6 percent vs. 3 percent, respectively). There were also differences between males and females in the reported number of times using marijuana in the past 30 days. Six percent of males reported using marijuana 40 times or more anywhere in the past 30 days, compared to 2 percent of females. One percent of males reported using marijuana 40 times or more on school property, compared to less than one-half percent of females (figure 16.2 and table 16.2).

Student reports on marijuana use anywhere and on school property differed by racial/ethnic group in 2009. Generally, the percentage of Asian students reporting using marijuana anywhere and on school property during the previous 30 days was smaller than that of most other racial/ethnic groups (figure 16.3 and table 16.1). For example, 7 percent of Asian students reported using marijuana anywhere, compared to 21 percent of White students; 22 percent each of Black students, Hispanic students, and students of two or more races; 25 percent of Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students; and 32 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native students. Similarly, a smaller percentage of Asian students (2 percent) reported using marijuana on school property than White students (4 percent), students of two or more races (5 percent), Black students and Hispanic students (6 percent each), and Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian students (9 percent). There was no statistically significant difference between the percentage of Asian students and the percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students reporting using marijuana on school property.

The percentages of 9th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students, who reported using marijuana anywhere in 2009 were lower than the percentages of students in those grades who used marijuana anywhere in 1999 (table 16.1). However, compared to a decade ago, there was no significant change in the percentage of 11th-graders who reported using marijuana anywhere. Lower percentages of students at each of grade levels 9 through 12 reported using marijuana on school property in 2009 than in 1999.

In 2009, a smaller percentage of 9th-graders reported using marijuana anywhere (16 percent), than 10th-graders (21 percent), 11th-graders (23 percent), and 12th-graders (25 percent) (figure 16.4 and table 16.1). There were no measurable differences between the percentages of students in any of the grades 9 thought 12 who reported the use of marijuana on school property in 2009. 

State level data were available in 42 states for students who reported using marijuana anywhere and in 38 states for students who reported using marijuana on school property. The percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere and on school property, varied among the states for which data were available in 2009. Among these states, the percentage of students who reported using marijuana anywhere ranged from 10 percent in Utah to 28 percent in New Mexico, while the percentage of students who reported using marijuana on school property ranged from 3 percent in Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, and South Dakota to 10 percent in New Mexico (table 16.3).

35 “On school property” was not defined for survey respondents.


Indicator 17
Students’ Perceptions of Personal Safety at School and Away From School

In 2009, a higher percentage of students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm at school (4 percent) than away from school (3 percent) during the school year. 

School violence can make students fearful and affect their readiness and ability to learn, and concerns about vulnerability to attacks can detract from a positive school environment (Scheckner et al. 2002). In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked how often36 they had been afraid of attack or harm “at school or on the way to and from school” as well as “away from school.”37 In 2009, a higher percentage of students ages 12–18 reported that they were afraid of attack or harm at school (4 percent) than away from school (3 percent) during the school year (figure 17.1 and table 17.1).

Student reports on their fears about their safety varied by sex and race/ethnicity. Though there were no measurable differences between the percentages of male and female students who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school in 2009, a greater percentage of female (4 percent) than male students (3 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school. A lower percentage of White students (3 percent) than Black students (7 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm at school, and a lower percentage of White students (2 percent) than both Black students (6 percent) and Hispanic students (4 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school. 

Differences in students’ reports on their safety were also detected by grade level in 2009. For example, higher percentages of 6th-graders and 7th-graders (6 percent each) reported being afraid of attack or harm at school than 8th-graders (4 percent) and 11th-graders (3 percent). Away from school, a higher percentage of 10th-graders (6 percent) reported being afraid of attack or harm than students in the 9th, 11th, and 12th grades (2 to 3 percent). 

School urbanicity was also related to students’ fear of attack or harm. Both at school and away from school, a higher percentage of students in urban schools reported being afraid of attack or harm than the corresponding percentages of students in suburban and rural schools. Specifically, 7 percent of students in urban schools reported being afraid of attack or harm at school, compared with 4 percent in rural schools and 3 percent in suburban schools. Six percent of students in urban schools, compared with 2 percent each of students in suburban and in rural schools, reported being afraid of attack or harm away from school. 

Between 1995 and 2009, the percentage of students who reported being afraid of attack or harm at school decreased from 12 to 4 percent (figure 17.2). A downward trend was also observed away from school: between 1999 and 2009, the percentage of students who feared attack or harm declined from 6 to 3 percent. Between the two most recent survey years, 2007 and 2009, the percentage of students who feared attack or harm at school was lower in 2009 (4 percent) than in 2007 (5 percent). However, no measurable differences were found between 2007 and 2009 in the percentages of students who feared attack or harm away from school.

36 Students were asked if they “never,” “almost never,” “sometimes,” or “most of the time” feared attack or harm at school or away from school. Students responding “sometimes” or “most of the time” were considered fearful.
37 “At school” includes the school building, on school property, on a school bus, and, from 2001 onward, going to and from school.


Indicator 18
Students’ Reports of Avoiding School Activities or Specific Places in School

In 2009, about 5 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they avoided school activities or one or more places in school because they thought someone might attack or harm them.

School crime may lead students to perceive school as unsafe, and in trying to ensure their own safety, students may begin to skip school activities or avoid certain places in school (Schreck and Miller 2003). The percentage of students who avoid school activities and certain areas in school is a measure of their perception of school safety. In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked whether they had avoided school activities or one or more places in school because they were fearful that someone might attack or harm them.38 In 2009, about 5 percent of students reported that they had avoided at least one school activity or one or more places in school during the previous school year because they feared being attacked or harmed. Specifically, 2 percent of students reported that they had avoided at least one school activity, and 4 percent reported that they had avoided one or more places in school39 (figure 18.1 and table 18.1).

While there was no overall pattern of increase or decrease between 1999 and 2009 in the percentage of students who reported that they had avoided at least one school activity or one or more places in school because of fear of attack or harm, the percentage of students who reported this avoidance was lower in 2009 (5 percent) than in 2007 (7 percent). In 2009, about 1 percent of students ages 12–18 reported that they had avoided any activities, 1 percent reported that they had avoided any classes, and 1 percent reported that they had stayed home from school. By school building location, 2 percent of students reported that they had avoided the stairs or hallways, 1 percent reported that they had avoided the entrance to the school, 1 percent reported that they had avoided parts of the school cafeteria, 1 percent reported that they had avoided any school restrooms, and 1 percent reported that they had avoided other places inside the school building.

Students’ reports of avoiding one or more places in school because of fear of attack or harm varied by student characteristics (figure 18.2 and table 18.2). In 2009, a higher percentage of Black students (6 percent) than White students (3 percent) reported avoiding one or more places in school (table 18.2). In addition, higher percentages of 6th-graders (7 percent), 7th-graders (5 percent), 8th-graders (5 percent), 9th-graders (4 percent), and 10th-graders (4 percent) reported avoiding one or more places in school than 12th-graders (2 percent) and 11th-graders (1 percent). No measurable differences were detected between the percentages of female and male students who avoided one or more places in school in 2009 (4 percent each). 

In 2009, school locale also was related to students’ reports of avoidance of places in school out of fear of attack or harm. A higher percentage of students in urban schools (6 percent) than in suburban schools (3 percent) reported avoiding one of more places during the school year.

38 For the 2001 survey, the wording was changed from “attack or harm” to “attack or threat of attack.” See appendix A for more information.
39 “Avoided school activities” includes avoiding any (extracurricular) activities, skipping class, or staying home from school. In 2007 and 2009, the survey wording was changed from “any extracurricular activities” to “any activities.” Please use caution when comparing changes in this item over time. Avoiding one or more places in school includes avoiding the entrance, any hallways or stairs, parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside the school building.


Indicator 19
Serious Disciplinary Actions Taken by Public Schools  

During the 2009–10 school year, 39 percent of public schools took at least one serious disciplinary action against a student for specific offenses. A total of 433,800 serious disciplinary actions were taken by public schools during this period.

In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked to report the number of disciplinary actions their schools had taken against students for specific offenses. The student offenses were physical attacks or fights; distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; use or possession of a firearm or explosive device; and use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device.

During the 2009–10 school year, 39 percent of public schools (32,300 schools) took at least one serious disciplinary action—including suspensions lasting 5 days or more, removals with no services for the remainder of the school year (i.e., expulsions), and transfers to specialized schools—for specific offenses (table 19.1). 

Out of all offenses reported, physical attacks or fights prompted the largest percentage of schools (29 percent) to respond with at least one serious disciplinary action (figure 19.1 and table 19.1). In response to other offenses by students, 20 percent of schools reported that they took disciplinary action for the distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs; 13 percent took action for the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device; 9 percent did so for the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol; and 3 percent did so for the use or possession of a firearm or explosive device.

During the 2009–10 school year, the percentage of public schools that took serious disciplinary actions increased with school level. A higher percentage of high schools (83 percent) took at least one serious disciplinary action than did middle schools (67 percent) and primary schools (18 percent). Combined schools took at least one serious disciplinary action at a higher percentage (49 percent) than primary schools, but at a lower percentage than either middle schools or high schools. This pattern by school level was generally observed for disciplinary actions taken in response to specific offenses as well. For example, 66 percent of high schools took serious disciplinary actions in response to distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs, compared with 37 percent of middle schools, 23 percent of combined schools, and 2 percent of primary schools.

A total of 433,800 serious disciplinary actions were taken by public schools during the 2009–10 school year. Most of these reported disciplinary actions were taken in response to physical attacks or fights (265,100 actions). The number of disciplinary actions taken in response to the use or possession of a firearm or explosive device (5,800 actions) was smaller than for other offenses reported. Of the serious disciplinary actions taken during the 2009–10 school year, 74 percent were suspensions for 5 days or more, 20 percent were transfers to specialized schools, and 6 percent were removals with no services for the remainder of the school year.

Greater percentages of out-of-school suspensions lasting 5 days or more were imposed upon students in response to physical attacks or fights (81 percent) and the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol (74 percent) than were imposed in response to the other offenses covered in the survey (ranging from 55 to 62 percent) (figure 19.2). Greater percentages of removals with no services for the remainder of the school year were imposed upon students in response to the use or possession of a firearm or explosive device (22 percent) than were imposed in response to other offenses reported (ranging from 4 to 9 percent). Greater percentages of transfers to specialized schools were imposed in response to the distribution, possession, or use of illegal drugs (32 percent) and the use or possession of a weapon other than a firearm or explosive device (29 percent) than were imposed in response to the distribution, possession, or use of alcohol (22 percent) and physical attacks or fights (14 percent). 

The percentage of schools taking at least one serious disciplinary action declined between 1999–2000 and 2009–10 from 54 to 39 percent (figure 19.3, table 19.2, and table 19.3). This same pattern of decline held true for the percentage of schools taking at least one serious disciplinary action for physical attacks or fights between 1999–2000 (35 percent) and 2009–10 (29 percent). No linear trends were detected in the percentages of schools that took at least one serious disciplinary action for other offenses over time between 1999–2000 and 2009–10, nor were measurable differences detected in the percentages between the two most recent survey years.


Indicator 20
Safety and Security Measures Taken by Public Schools 

During the 2009–10 school year, 93 percent of public schools reported that they had limited the access to social networking websites from school computers, and 91 percent reported that they had prohibited the use of cell phones and text messaging devices during school hours.

Public schools use a variety of practices and procedures to promote the safety of students and staff. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school principals were asked about their schools’ use of safety and security measures and procedures. Certain practices, such as locked or monitored doors or gates, are intended to limit or control access to school campuses, while others, such as metal detectors, security cameras, and limiting access to social networking websites, are intended to monitor or restrict students’ and visitors’ behavior on campus.

In the 2009–10 school year, nearly all public schools reported that they required visitors to sign in or check in (99 percent) (table 20.1). Other frequently reported safety and security measures included limiting access to social networking websites from school computers (93 percent), controlling access to school buildings by locking or monitoring doors during school hours (92 percent), and prohibiting the use of cell phones and text messaging devices during school hours (91 percent) (figure 20.1). In addition, 63 percent of public schools reported that they had an electronic notification system for a school wide emergency, and 36 percent reported that they had a structured, anonymous threat reporting system in place.

The use of safety and security measures varied by school level during the 2009–10 school year. In general, higher percentages of high schools than middle or primary schools and higher percentages of middle schools than primary schools reported using the following safety and security measures: drug testing for athletes; drug testing for students in extracurricular activities;40 requiring students to wear badges or picture IDs; random dog sniffs to check for drugs;40 random sweeps for contraband;41,42 and using security cameras to monitor the school40 (table 20.2). For example, 84 percent of high schools, 73 percent of middle schools, and 51 percent of primary schools reported that they used security cameras to monitor their schools. In addition, the percentages of middle schools (71 percent) and high schools (67 percent) that reported having an electronic notification system for a school wide emergency were higher than the percentage of primary schools with such a system (61 percent), and the percentages of middle schools (48 percent) and high schools (46 percent) having a structured, anonymous threat reporting system in place were higher than the percentage of primary schools (30 percent) having such a system in place. However, a lower percentage of high schools (86 percent) than middle schools and primary schools (94 percent each) reported controlling access to buildings during school hours, and the percentage of high schools (80 percent) that reported prohibiting the use of cell phones and text messaging devices was lower than the corresponding percentages of primary schools (93 percent) and middle schools (97 percent). The percentage of higher schools (10 percent) that reported requiring students to wear uniforms was lower than the percentages of middle schools (19 percent) and primary schools (22 percent) with such a requirement.

In the 2009–10 school year, the use of safety and security measures also differed by school enrollment size. Higher percentages of public schools with 1,000 or more students than schools with fewer students reported the use of the following safety and security measures: controlling access to grounds during school hours; drug testing for athletes; requiring students to wear badges or picture IDs; metal detector checks on students (including both random checks and requiring students to pass through checks daily); random dog sniffs to check for drugs; having a structured, anonymous threat reporting system in place; and using security cameras to monitor the school. For example, 56 percent of schools with an enrollment size of 1,000 or more students reported having a structured, anonymous threat reporting system, compared with 38 percent of schools with an enrollment size of 500–999 students, 32 percent of schools with an enrollment size of 300–499 students, and 28 percent of schools with an enrollment size of less than 300 students.

Locale and the school’s percentage of students who are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch were also associated with the use of safety and security measures in the 2009–10 school year. Higher percentages of city schools than schools in suburban, town, and rural areas reported controlling access to school grounds during school hours, conducting random metal detector checks, and requiring students to wear uniforms. For example, 35 percent of city schools reported requiring students to wear uniforms, compared with 19 percent of suburban schools, 10 percent of schools in towns, and 9 percent of rural schools reporting such a requirement. Higher percentages of high-poverty schools (where 76 percent or more students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch) than low-poverty schools (where 25 percent or less of students are eligible for free or reduced-price lunch) reported controlling access to school grounds during school hours, requiring students to wear badges or picture IDs, conducting random metal detector checks on students, and requiring students to wear uniforms. For instance, 11 percent of high-poverty schools reported conducting random metal detector checks on students, compared with 1 percent of low-poverty schools reporting such checks.

The percentage of schools using various security measures has changed over time. Between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 school years, the percentages of public schools reporting the use of the following safety and security measures increased: controlling access to buildings during school hours (from 75 to 92 percent); controlling access to school grounds during school hours (from 34 to 46 percent); requiring faculty to wear badges or picture IDs (from 25 to 63 percent); using one or more security cameras to monitor the school (from 19 to 61 percent); providing telephones in most classrooms (from 45 to 74 percent); and requiring that students wear uniforms (from 12 to 19 percent) (figure 20.2 and table 20.1). In addition, between the 2007–08 and 2009–10 school years, there was an increase in the percentage of schools reporting the use of an electronic notification system for a school wide emergency (from 43 to 63 percent) as well as an increase in the percentage of schools that reported having a structured, anonymous threat reporting system (from 31 to 36 percent).

41 One or more checks, sweeps, or cameras.
42 For example, drugs or weapons. Does not include dog sniffs.


Indicator 21
Students’ Reports of Safety and Security Measures Observed at School

Sixty-four percent of students ages 12–18 reported observing locked entrance or exit doors during the day at their schools in 2009, compared with 61 percent of students in 2007.

Schools use a variety of measures to promote the safety of students, ranging from codes of student conduct to metal detectors. In the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12–18 were asked whether their schools used certain security measures.43 Security measures include metal detectors, locker checks, security cameras, security guards or police officers, adult supervision in hallways, badges or picture identification for students, a code of student conduct, locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and a requirement that visitors sign in. In 2009, nearly all students (99 percent) ages 12–18 reported that they observed the use of at least one of the selected security measures at their schools (figure 21.1 and table 21.1).

The majority of students ages 12–18 reported in 2009 that their schools had a code of student conduct (96 percent) and a requirement that visitors sign in (94 percent). Approximately 68 percent of students reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned police officers, and 91 percent reported the presence of other school staff or other adult supervision in the hallway. Some 70 percent of students reported the use of security cameras at their schools, 64 percent reported locked entrance or exit doors during the day, and 54 percent reported locker checks. In addition, 23 percent of students reported that badges or picture identifications were required at their schools. Metal detectors were the least observed of the selected safety and security measures: 11 percent of students reported the use of metal detectors at their schools.

The percentages of students who reported the presence of some of the selected security measures at school has increased over time as well as between the two most recent survey years. Specifically, the percentage of students who reported observing the use of one or more security cameras at their schools was 70 percent in 2009, which represented an increase from 39 percent in 2001 as well as an increase from 66 percent in 2007. Similarly, the percentage of students who reported observing locked entrance or exit doors during the day was 64 percent in 2009, which represented an increase from 38 percent in 1999 as well as an increase from 61 percent in 2007. Higher percentages of students in 2009 than in 1999 reported the presence of security guards and/or assigned police officers (68 vs. 54 percent) and the presence of other school staff or other adult supervision in the hallway (91 vs. 85 percent).

Between 1999 and 2009, the percentage of students who reported a visitor sign-in requirement increased from 87 to 94 percent, although no measurable differences in the percentage were detected between the two most recent survey years, 2007 and 2009 (94 percent each). Across all survey years, no measurable differences were detected in the percentages of students who reported locker checks, requirements that students wear badges or picture identification, or a code of student conduct in their schools during the school year.

43 Readers should note that this indicator relies on student reports of security measures and provides estimates based on students’ awareness of the measure rather than on documented practice. See Indicator 20 for a summary of the use of various security measures as reported by schools.

Appendix A: Technical Notes
General Information

The indicators in this report are based on information drawn from a variety of independent data sources, including national surveys of students, teachers, and principals, and data collections from federal departments and agencies, including the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source has an independent sample design, data collection method, and questionnaire design or is the result of a universe data collection. Universe data collections include a census of all known entities in a specific universe (e.g., all deaths occurring on school property). Readers should be cautious when comparing data from different sources. Differences in sampling procedures, populations, time periods, and question phrasing can all affect the comparability of results. For example, some questions from different surveys may appear the same, but were asked of different populations of students (e.g., students ages 12–18 or students in grades 9–12); in different years; about experiences that occurred within different periods of time (e.g., in the past 30 days or during the past 12 months); or at different locations (e.g., in school or anywhere). 

All comparisons described in this report are statistically significant at the .05 level. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student’s t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. Estimates displayed in the text, figures, and tables are rounded from original estimates, not from a series of rounding. 

The following is a description of data sources, accuracy of estimates, and statistical procedures used in this report.

Sources of Data

This section briefly describes each of the datasets used in this report: the School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study, the Supplementary Homicide Reports, the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal, the National Crime Victimization Survey, the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, the Schools and Staffing Survey, and the School Survey on Crime and Safety. Directions for obtaining more information are provided at the end of each description. 

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD) 

The School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study (SAVD) is an epidemiological study developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to describe the epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths, identify common features of these deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated violent death in the United States, and identify potential risk factors for these deaths. The surveillance system includes descriptive data on all school-associated violent deaths in the United States, including all homicides, suicides, or legal intervention in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school; while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school; or while attending or on the way to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims of such incidents include nonstudents, as well as students and staff members. SAVD includes descriptive information about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). The SAVD Surveillance System has collected data from July 1, 1992, through the present. 

SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on school-associated violent deaths. Cases are initially identified through a search of the LexisNexis newspaper and media database. Then law enforcement  officials are contacted to confirm the details of the case and to determine if the event meets the case definition. Once a case is confirmed, a law enforcement official and a school official are interviewed regarding details about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). A copy of the full law enforcement report is also sought for each case. The information obtained on schools includes school demographics, attendance/absentee rates, suspensions/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon-carrying incidents, security measures, violence prevention activities, school response to the event, and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information includes the location of injury, the context of injury (while classes were being held, during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of injury, and school and community events happening around the time period. Information obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) includes demographics, circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug use, number of persons involved), types and origins of weapons, criminal history, psychological risk factors, school-related problems, extracurricular activities, and family history, including structure and stressors. 

One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths were identified from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 1994 (Kachur et al. 1996). A more recent report from this data collection identified 253 school-associated violent deaths between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999 (Anderson et al. 2001). Other publications from this study have described how the number of events change during the school year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2001), the source of the firearms used in these events (Reza et al. 2003), and suicides that were associated with schools (Kauffman et al. 2004). The most recent publication describes trends in school associated homicide from July 1, 1992, to June 30, 2006 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2008). The interviews conducted on cases between July 1, 1994, and June 30, 1999, achieved a response rate of 97 percent for police officials and 78 percent for school officials. For several reasons, all data for years from 1999 to the present are flagged as preliminary . For some recent data, the interviews with school and law enforcement officials to verify case details have not been completed. The details learned during the interviews can occasionally change the classification of a case. Also, new cases may be identified because of the expansion of the scope of the media files used for case identification. Sometimes other cases not identified during earlier data years using the independent case finding efforts (which focus on nonmedia sources of information) will be discovered. Also, other cases may occasionally be identified while the law enforcement and school interviews are being conducted to verify known cases. For additional information about SAVD, contact:

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) 

The Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), which are a part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, provide incident-level information on criminal homicides, including situation (number of victims to number of offenders); the age, sex, and race of victims and known offenders; types of weapons used; circumstances of the incident; and the relationship of the victim to the offender. The data are provided monthly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) by local law enforcement agencies participating in the FBI’s UCR program. The data include murders and nonnegligent manslaughters in the United States from January 1980 to December 2009; that is, negligent manslaughters and justifiable homicides have been eliminated from the data. Based on law enforcement agency reports, the FBI estimates that 581,709 murders (including non-negligent manslaughters) were committed from 1980 to 2009. Agencies provided detailed information on 522,564 of these homicide victims. 

About 90 percent of homicides are included in the SHR. However, adjustments can be made to the weights to correct for missing victim reports. Estimates from the SHR used in this report were generated by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) using a weight developed by BJS that reconciles the counts of SHR homicide victims with those in the UCR for the 1992 through 2009 data years. The weight is the same for all cases for a given year. The weight represents the ratio of the number of homicides reported in the UCR to the number reported in the SHR.

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal (WISQARS™ Fatal) 

WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to injury. The mortality data reported in WISQARS Fatal come from death certificate data reported to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data include causes of death reported by attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. It also includes demographic information about decedents reported by funeral directors, who obtain that information from family members and other informants. NCHS collects, compiles, verifies, and prepares these data for release to the public. The data provide information about what types of injuries are leading causes of deaths, how common they are, and who they affect. These data are intended for a broad audience—the public, the media, public health practitioners and researchers, and public health officials—to increase their knowledge of injury. 

WISQARS Fatal mortality reports provide tables of the total numbers of injury-related deaths and the death rates per 100,000 U.S. population. The reports list deaths according to cause (mechanism) and intent (manner) of injury by state, race, Hispanic origin, sex, and age groupings. For more information on WISQARS Fatal, contact:

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) 

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), administered for the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau, is the nation’s primary source of information on crime and the victims of crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned in 1992, the NCVS collects detailed information on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, theft, household burglary, and motor vehicle theft experienced by Americans and their households each year. The survey measures both crimes reported to police and crimes not reported to the police. 

In past reports, the NCVS estimates were reported using the data-year format. Under the data-year format, crime incidents are reported based on the year that the incident actually occurred. Thus, given that the NCVS employs a six month retrospective reference period, 18 months of interviews are necessary to estimate a year of crime incidents. For example, a respondent interviewed in June, 2010 may indicate that a crime occurred in December, 2009. Under the data-year format that crime would be counted in 2009. Under the alternative collection-year format, crime incidents are reported based on when the interview was conducted, not when the crime occurred. In the previous example the crime would be counted in 2010. Whereas the data-year format requires 18 months of interviews to estimate crime incidents, the collection-year format requires only 12 months. Therefore, estimates of crime can be reported in a more timely fashion under the collection-year format. Analyses comparing victimization estimates based on collection year to those based on data year show a very small difference in the estimates and the majority of BJS publications use the collection-year format. Consequently, BJS has decided to update this report to include collection-year estimates for the NCVS. 

Readers should note that in 2003, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget’s standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the NCVS item on race/ethnicity was modified. A question on Hispanic origin is followed by a question on race. The new question about race allows the respondent to choose more than one race and delineates Asian as a separate category from Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander. Analysis conducted by the Demographic Surveys Division at the U.S. Census Bureau showed that the new question had very little impact on the aggregate racial distribution of the NCVS respondents, with one exception. There was a 1.6 percentage point decrease in the percentage of respondents who reported themselves as White. Due to changes in race/ethnicity categories, comparisons of race/ethnicity across years should be made with caution. 

There were changes in the sample design and survey methodology in the 2006 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) that may have affected survey estimates. Caution should be used when comparing 2006 estimates to other years. Data from 2007 onward are comparable to earlier years. Analyses of the 2007 estimates indicate that the program changes made in 2006 had relatively small effects on NCVS changes. For more information on the 2006 NCVS data, see Criminal Victimization, 2006 at http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv06.pdf, the technical notes at http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv06tn.pdf, and Criminal Victimization, 2007 at http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv07.pdf. 

The number of NCVS eligible households in sample in 2010 was about 41,000. They were selected using a stratified, multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties, were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were selected from each sampled PSU. Finally, from selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments, were selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done proportionate to population size in order to create a self-weighting sample. The final sample was augmented to account for households constructed after the decennial Census. Within each sampled household, U.S. Census Bureau personnel attempts to interview all household members age 12 and older to determine whether they had been victimized by the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the interview. 

The first NCVS interview with a housing unit is conducted in person. Subsequent interviews are conducted by telephone, if possible. About 73,000 persons age 12 and older are interviewed each 6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years and are interviewed seven times at 6-month intervals. Since the survey’s inception, the initial interview at each sample unit has been used only to bound future interviews to establish a time frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent interviews. Beginning in 2006, data from the initial interview have been adjusted to account for the effects of bounding and included in the survey estimates. After their seventh interview, households are replaced by new sample households. The NCVS has consistently obtained a response rate of over 90 percent at the household level. The completion rates for persons within households in 2010 were about 87 percent. Weights were developed to permit estimates for the total U.S. population 12 years and older.

School Crime Supplement (SCS) 

Created as a supplement to the NCVS and co designed by the National Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the School Crime Supplement (SCS) survey has been conducted in 1989, 1995, and biennially since 1999 to collect additional information about school-related victimizations on a national level. This report includes data from the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 collections. The 1989 data are not included in this report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS. The SCS was designed to assist policymakers, as well as academic researchers and practitioners at federal, state, and local levels, to make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The survey asks students a number of key questions about their experiences with and perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their school, on school grounds, on the school bus, or on the way to or from school. Students are asked additional questions about security measures used by their school, students’ participation in after school activities, students’ perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons and gangs in school, the presence of hate-related words and graffiti in school, student reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the availability of drugs and alcohol in school. Students are also asked attitudinal questions relating to fear of victimization and avoidance behavior at school.

The SCS survey was conducted for a 6-month period from January through June in all households selected for the NCVS (see discussion above for information about the NCVS sampling design and changes to the race/ethnicity variable beginning in 2003. Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS were those household members who had attended school at any time during the 6 months preceding the interview, were enrolled in grades 6–12, and were not home schooled. In 2007, the questionnaire was changed and household members who attended school sometime during the school year of the interview were included. The age range of students covered in this report is 12–18 years of age. Eligible respondents were asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing their entire NCVS interview. It should be noted that the first or unbounded NCVS interview has always been included in analysis of the SCS data and may result in the reporting of events outside of the requested reference period.

The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 was calculated by using NCVS incident variables appended to the SCS data files of the same year. The NCVS type of crime variable was used to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent, violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident happened (at school) and what the victim was doing when it happened (attending school or on the way to or from school) were used to ascertain whether the incident happened at school. Only incidents that occurred inside the United States are included.

In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified from previous collections. First, in 1995 and 1999, “at school” was defined for respondents as in the school building, on the school grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the definition for “at school” was changed to mean in the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. This change was made to the 2001 questionnaire in order to be consistent with the definition of “at school” as it is constructed in the NCVS and was also used as the definition in subsequent SCS collections. Cognitive interviews conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau on the 1999 SCS suggested that modifications to the definition of “at school” would not have a substantial impact on the estimates.

A total of 9,700 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 8,400 in 1999, about 8,400 in 2001, about 7,200 in 2003, about 6,300 in 2005, about 5,600 in 2007, and 5,000 in 2009. In the 2009 SCS, the household completion rate was 92 percent. 

In the 1995, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 SCS, the household completion rates were 95 percent, 94 percent, 93 percent, 92 percent,  91 percent, and 90 percent respectively, and the student completion rates were 78 percent, 78 percent, 77 percent, 70 percent,  62 percent, and 58 percent respectively. For the 2009 SCS, the student completion rate was 56 percent. The overall unweighted SCS unit response rate (calculated by multiplying the household completion rate by the student completion rate) was 74 percent in 1995, about 73 percent in 1999, about 72 percent in 2001, about 64 percent in 2003, about 56 percent in 2005, about 53 percent in 2007, and 51 percent in 2009. 

There are two types of nonresponse: unit and item nonresponse. NCES requires that any stage of data collection within a survey that has a unit base-weighted response rate of less than 85 percent be evaluated for the potential magnitude of unit nonresponse bias before the data or any analysis using the data may be released (U.S. Department of Education 2003). Due to the low unit response rate in 2005, 2007, and 2009, a unit nonresponse bias analysis was done. Unit response rates indicate how many sampled units have completed interviews. Because interviews with students could only be completed after households had responded to the NCVS, the unit completion rate for the SCS reflects both the household interview completion rate and the student interview completion rate. Nonresponse can greatly affect the strength and application of survey data by leading to an increase in variance as a result of a reduction in the actual size of the sample and can produce bias if the nonrespondents have characteristics of interest that are different from the respondents. 

In order for response bias to occur, respondents must have different response rates and responses to particular survey variables. The magnitude of unit nonresponse bias is determined by the response rate and the differences between respondents and nonrespondents on key survey variables. Although the bias analysis cannot measure response bias since the SCS is a sample survey and it is not known how the population would have responded, the SCS sampling frame has four key student or school characteristic variables for which data is known for respondents and nonrespondents: sex, race/ethnicity, household income, and urbanicity, all of which are associated with student victimization. To the extent that there are differential responses by respondents in these groups, nonresponse bias is a concern.

In 2005, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias for the race, household income, and urbanicity variables. White (non-Hispanic) and Other (non-Hispanic) respondents had higher response rates than Black (non-Hispanic) and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households with an income of $35,000–$49,999 and $50,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $7,500, $7,500–$14,999, $15,000–$24,999 and $25,000–$34,999. Respondents who live in urban areas had lower response rates than those who live in rural or suburban areas. Although the extent of nonresponse bias cannot be determined, weighting adjustments, which corrected for differential response rates, should have reduced the problem.

In 2007, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of bias by the race/ethnicity and household income variables. Hispanic respondents had lower response rates than other race/ethnicities.

Respondents from households with an income of $25,000 or more had higher response rates than those from households with incomes of less than $25,000. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates.

In 2009, the analysis of unit nonresponse bias found evidence of potential bias for the race/ethnicity and urbanicity variables. White students and students of other race/ethnicities had higher response rates than did Black and Hispanic respondents. Respondents from households located in rural areas had higher response rates than those from households located in urban areas. However, when responding students are compared to the eligible NCVS sample, there were no measurable differences between the responding students and the eligible students, suggesting the nonresponse bias has little impact on the overall estimates. All analyses for this report are conducted with weighted survey data so that estimates are representative of the population. Weighting the data adjusts for unequal selection probabilities and for the effects of nonresponse.

Response rates for most SCS survey items in all survey years were high—typically over 97 percent of all eligible respondents meaning there is little potential for item nonresponse bias for most items in the survey. Weights were developed to compensate for differential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in all SCS data years.

Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) 

The National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is one component of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), an epidemiological surveillance system developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor the prevalence of youth behaviors that most influence health. The YRBS focuses on priority health-risk behaviors established during youth that result in the most significant mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems during both youth and adulthood. This report uses 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2009 YRBS data.

The YRBS uses a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce a nationally representative sample of students in grades 9–12 in the United States. The target population consisted of all public and private school students in grades 9–12 in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame included selecting primary sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization and the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU. These PSUs are either counties; subareas of large counties; or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. At the second stage, schools were selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size.

The final stage of sampling consisted of randomly selecting, in each chosen school and in each of grades 9–12, one or two classrooms from either a required subject, such as English or social studies, or a required period, such as homeroom or second period. All students in selected classes were eligible to participate. Three strategies were used to oversample Black and Hispanic students: (1) larger sampling rates were used to select PSUs that are in high-Black and high-Hispanic strata; (2) a modified measure of size was used that increased the probability of selecting schools with a disproportionately high percentage of combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment; and (3) two classes per grade, rather than one, were selected in schools with a high percentage of combined Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native enrollment. Approximately 16,300 students participated in the 1993 survey, 10,900 students participated in the 1995 survey, 16,300 students participated in the 1997 survey, 15,300 students participated in the 1999 survey, 13,600 students participated in the 2001 survey, 15,200 students participated in the 2003 survey, 13,900 students participated in the 2005 survey, 14,000 students participated in the 2007 survey, and 16,400 students participated in the 2009 survey. 

The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent for the 1999 survey, 63 percent for the 2001 survey, 67 percent for the 2003 survey, 67 percent for the 2005 survey, 68 percent for the 2007 survey, and 71 percent for the 2009 survey. NCES standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for cross-sectional surveys, and bias analyses are required by NCES when that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis are not available. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of Black and Hispanic students in the sample. The final weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched national population projections.

State-level data were downloaded from the Youth Online: Comprehensive Results web page. Each state and local school-based YRBS employs a two-stage, cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in grades 9–12 in their jurisdiction. All except a few state and local samples include only public schools, and each local sample includes only schools in the funded school district (e.g., San Diego Unified School District) rather than in the entire city (e.g., greater San Diego area).

In the first sampling stage in all except a few states and districts, schools are selected with probability proportional to school enrollment size. In the second sampling stage, intact classes of a required subject or intact classes during a required period (e.g., second period) are selected randomly. All students in sampled classes are eligible to participate. Certain states and districts modify these procedures to meet their individual needs. For example, in a given state or district, all schools, rather than a sample of schools, might be selected to participate. State and local surveys that have a scientifically selected sample, appropriate documentation, and an overall response rate greater than or equal to 60 percent are weighted. The overall response rate reflects the school response rate multiplied by the student response rate. These three criteria are used to ensure that the data from those surveys can be considered representative of students in grades 9–12 in that jurisdiction. A weight is applied to each record to adjust for student nonresponse and the distribution of students by grade, sex, and race/ethnicity in each jurisdiction. Therefore, weighted estimates are representative of all students in grades 9–12 attending schools in each jurisdiction. Surveys that do not have an overall response rate of greater than or equal to 60 percent and that do not have appropriate documentation are not weighted and are not included in this report. 

In 2009, a total of 42 states and 20 districts had weighted data. Not all of the districts were contained in the 42 states. For example, California was not one of the 42 states that obtained weighted data but it contained several districts that did. For more information on the location of the districts please see http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/participation.htm. In sites with weighted data, the student sample sizes for the state and local YRBS ranged from 965 to 14,870. School response rates ranged from 73 to 100 percent, student response rates ranged from 61 to 90 percent, and overall response rates ranged from 60 to 94 percent. 

Readers should note that reports of these data published by the CDC and in this report do not include percentages where the denominator includes less than 100 unweighted cases.

In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and Budget’s standards for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 was:

How do you describe yourself? 

a.	White—not Hispanic 
b.	Black—not Hispanic 
c.	Hispanic or Latino 
d.	Asian or Pacific Islander 
e.	American Indian or Alaskan Native 
f.	Other 

The version used in 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, and 2007 and in the 2009 state and local surveys was: 

How do you describe yourself? (Select one or more responses.) 

a.	American Indian or Alaska Native 
b.	Asian 
c.	Black or African American 
d.	Hispanic or Latino 
e.	Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 
f.	White

In the 2005 national survey and in all 2007 and 2009 surveys, race/ethnicity was computed from two questions: (1) “Are you Hispanic or Latino?” (response options were “yes” and “no”), and (2) “What is your race?” (response options were “American Indian or Alaska Native,” “Asian,” “Black or African American,” “Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,” or “White”). For the second question, students could select more than one response option. For this report, students were classified as “Hispanic” if they answered “yes” to the first question, regardless of how they answered the second question. Students who answered “no” to the first question and selected more than one race/ethnicity in the second category were classified as “More than one race.” Students who answered “no” to the first question and selected only one race/ethnicity were classified as that race/ethnicity. Race/ethnicity was classified as missing for students who did not answer the first question and for students who answered “no” to the first question but did not answer the second question.

CDC has conducted two studies to understand the effect of changing the race/ethnicity item on the YRBS. Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing students to select more than one response to a single race/ethnicity question on the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ethnicity among high school students. Eaton, Brener, Kann, and Pittman (2007) found that self-reported race/ethnicity was similar regardless of whether the single-question or a two-question format was used.

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) 

This report draws upon data on teacher victimization from the Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS), which provides national- and state-level data on public schools and national- and affiliation-level data on private schools. The 1993–94, 1999–2000, 2003–04, and 2007–08 SASS were collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The 1993–94, 1999–2000, and 2003–04 administrations of SASS consisted of four sets of linked surveys, including surveys of schools, the principals of each selected school, a subsample of teachers within each school, and public school districts. The 2007–08 administration of SASS consisted of five types of questionnaires: district questionnaires, principal questionnaires, school questionnaires, teacher questionnaires, and school library media center questionnaires. In 1993–94, there were two sets of teacher surveys, public and private school teachers. In 1999–2000, there were four sets of teacher surveys, public, private, public charter, and Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) school teachers. In 2003–04 and 2007–08, there were three sets of teacher surveys, public (including public charter), private, and BIE. For this report, BIE and public charter schools are included with public schools. 

The public school sampling frames for the 1993–94, 1999–2000, 2003–04, and 2007–08 SASS were created using the 1991–92, 1997–98, 2001–02, and 2005–06 NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) Public School Universe Files, respectively. In SASS, a school was defined as an institution or part of an institution that provides classroom instruction to students; has one or more teachers to provide instruction; serves students in one or more of grades 1–12 or the ungraded equivalent and is located in one or more buildings apart from a private home. It was possible for two or more schools to share the same building; in this case they were treated as different schools if they had different administrations (i.e., principals or school head). Since CCD and SASS differ in scope and their definition of a school, some records were deleted, added, or modified in order to provide better coverage and a more efficient sample design for SASS. Data were collected by multistage sampling, which began with the selection of schools. 

This report uses 1993–94, 1999–2000, 2003–04, and 2007–08 SASS data. Approximately 10,000 public schools and 3,300 private schools were selected to participate in the 1993–94 SASS, 11,100 public schools (9,900 public schools, 100 BIE-funded schools, and 1,100 charter schools) and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the 1999–2000 SASS, 10,400 public schools (10,200 public schools and 200 BIE-funded schools) and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the 2003–04 SASS, and 9,980 public schools (9,800 public schools and 180 BIE-funded schools) and 2,940 private schools were selected to participate in the 2007–08 SASS. Within each school, teachers selected were further stratified into one of five teacher types in the following hierarchy: (1) Asian or Pacific Islander; (2) American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; (3) teachers who teach classes designed for students with limited English proficiency; (4) teachers in their first, second, or third year of teaching; and (5) teachers not classified in any of the other groups. Within each teacher stratum, teachers were selected systematically with equal probability. In 1993–94, approximately 57,000 public school teachers and 11,500 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999– 2000, about 56,300 public school teachers, 500 BIE teachers, 4,400 public charter school teachers, and 10,800 private school teachers were sampled. In 2003–04, about 52,500 public school teachers, 700 BIE teachers, and 10,000 private school teachers were sampled. In 2007–08, about 47,440 public school teachers, 750 BIE teachers, and 8,180 private school teachers were sampled.

This report focuses on responses from teachers. The overall weighted response rate for public school teachers in 1993–94 was 88 percent. In 1999–2000, the overall weighted response rates were 77 percent for public school teachers, and 86 and 72 percent for BIE and public charter school teachers, respectively (which are included with public school teachers for this report). In 2003–04, the overall weighted response rates were 76 percent for public school teachers and 86 percent for BIE-funded school teachers (who are included with public school teachers). In 2007–08, the overall weighted response rates were 72 percent for public school teachers and 71 percent for BIE-funded school teachers (who are included with public school teachers). For private school teachers, the overall weighted response rates were 80 percent in 1993–94, about 67 percent in 1999–2000, about 70 percent in 2003–04, and 66 percent in 2007–08. Values were imputed for questionnaire items that should have been answered but were not. For additional information about SASS, contact:

School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) 

The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) is managed by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education. SSOCS collects extensive crime and safety data from principals and school administrators of U.S. public schools. Data from this collection can be used to examine the relationship between school characteristics and violent and serious violent crimes in primary schools, middle schools, high schools, and combined schools. In addition, data from SSOCS can be used to assess what crime prevention programs, practices, and policies are used by schools. SSOCS has been conducted in school years 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2005–06, 2007–08, and 2009–10. A sixth collection is planned for school year 2011–12.

SSOCS was developed by NCES and is funded by the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools of the U.S. Department of Education. The 2009–10 SSOCS (SSOCS:2010) was conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Data collection began on February 24, 2010, when questionnaire packets were mailed to sampled schools, and continued through June 11, 2010. A total of 2,648 public schools submitted usable questionnaires: 684 primary schools, 909 middle schools, 948 high schools, and 107 combined schools.

The sampling frame for SSOCS:2010 was constructed from the 2007–08 Public Elementary/Secondary School Universe data file of the Common Core of Data (CCD), an annual collection of data on all public K–12 schools and school districts. The SSOCS sampling frame was restricted to regular public schools in the United States and the District of Columbia (including charter schools).

A total of 3,476 schools were selected for the 2010 study. In February 2010, questionnaires were mailed to school principals, who were asked to complete the survey or to have it completed by the person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at the school. A total of 2,648 schools completed the survey. The weighted overall response rate was 80.8 percent.1 A nonresponse bias analysis was conducted on the 3 items with weighted item nonresponse rates below 85 percent. The detected bias was not deemed problematic enough to suppress any items from the data file. Weights were developed to adjust for the variable probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse and can be used to produce national estimates for regular public schools in the 2009–10 school year. For information on the 1999–2000, 2003–04, 2005–06, 2007–08, and 2009–10 iterations, see Neiman, S. (2011). For more information about the School Survey on Crime and Safety, contact:

Accuracy of Estimates

The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint effects of nonsampling and sampling errors. Both types of error affect the estimates presented in this report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For example, members of the population of interest are inadvertently excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse to answer some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the survey questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ from the “true” responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult. 

Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not subject to sampling errors. Estimates based on a sample will differ somewhat from those that would have been obtained by a complete census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments, instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents the population difference. 

Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex sampling designs rather than a simple random design. The features of complex sampling require different techniques to calculate standard errors than are used for data collected using a simple random sampling. Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most of the statistics and their standard errors in this report. 

Standard error calculation for data from the School Crime Supplement was based on the Taylor series approximation method using PSU and strata variables available from each dataset. For statistics based on all years of NCVS data, standard errors were derived from a formula developed by the U.S. Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. 

The coefficient of variation (CV) represents the ratio of the standard error to the mean. As an attribute of a distribution, the CV is an important measure of the reliability and accuracy of an estimate. In this report, the CV was calculated for all estimates, and in cases where the CV was at least 30 percent the estimates were noted with a ! symbol (interpret data with caution). In cases where the CV was greater than 50 percent, the estimate was determined not to meet reporting standards and was suppressed.

Statistical Procedures 

The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical significance to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to sampling variation. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the report are statistically significant at the .05 level. Several test procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure used in this report was Student’s t statistic, which tests the difference between two sample estimates. The t test formula was not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The formula used to compute the t statistic is as follows: 

(1) INSERT EQUATION

where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be compared and se1 and se2 are their corresponding standard errors. Note that this formula is valid only for independent estimates. When the estimates are not independent (for example, when comparing a total percentage with that for a subgroup included in the total), a covariance term (i.e., 2 * r * se1 * se2) must be subtracted from the denominator of the formula:  

(2) INSERT EQUATION

where r is the correlation coefficient. Once the t value was computed, it was compared to the published tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this report, an alpha value of .05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If the t value was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two estimates is statistically significant at the 95 percent level. 

A linear trend test was used when differences among percentages were examined relative to ordered categories of a variable, rather than the differences between two discrete categories. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with, for example, student’s age as the independent variable and whether a student was physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test involves computing the regression coefficient (b and its corresponding standard error se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that there is no linear relationship between student’s age and being physically attacked is rejected.

Some comparisons among categories of an ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to partition the total sum of squares into within- and between-group sums of squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within- and between-group variance components and their corresponding F statistics, which were then compared to published values of F for a significance level of .05. Significant values of both the overall F and the F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a linear relationship between the two variables.

1 The weighted response rate is calculated by applying the base sampling rates to the following ratio: completed cases/(total sample—known ineligibles).

Appendix B: Glossary of Terms

General Terms

Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any act that the government has determined is injurious to the public, including felonies and misdemeanors. Such violation may or may not involve violence, and it may affect individuals or property. 

Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving one or more victims and one or more offenders. 

Multistage sampling A survey sampling technique in which there is more than one wave of sampling. That is, one sample of units is drawn, and then another sample is drawn within that sample. For example, at the first stage, a number of Census blocks may be sampled out of all the Census blocks in the United States. At the second stage, households are sampled within the previously sampled Census blocks. 

Prevalence The percentage of the population directly affected by crime in a given period. This rate is based upon specific information elicited directly from the respondent regarding crimes committed against his or her person, against his or her property, or against an individual bearing a unique relationship to him or her. It is not based upon perceptions and beliefs about, or reactions to, criminal acts. 

School - An education institution consisting of one or more of grades K through 12. 

School crime - Any criminal activity that is committed on school property. 

School year - The 12-month period of time denoting the beginning and ending dates for school accounting purposes, usually from July 1 through June 30. 

Stratification - A survey sampling technique in which the target population is divided into mutually exclusive groups or strata based on some variable or variables (e.g., metropolitan area) and sampling of units occurs separately within each stratum. 

Unequal probabilities - A survey sampling technique in which sampled units do not have the same probability of selection into the sample. For example, the investigator may oversample rural students in order to increase the sample sizes of rural students. Rural students would then be more likely than other students to be sampled.

Specific Terms Used in Various Surveys

School-Associated Violent Deaths Surveillance Study  (SAVD)

Homicide - An act involving a killing of one person by another resulting from interpersonal violence. 

School-associated violent death A homicide or suicide in which the fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the United States, while the victim was on the way to or from regular sessions at such a school, or while the victim was attending or traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event. Victims included nonstudents as well as students and staff members. 

Suicide - An act of taking one’s own life voluntarily and intentionally. 

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)

Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with a weapon, regardless of whether or not an injury occurs, and attack without a weapon when serious injury results. 

At school (students) Inside the school building, on school property (school parking area, play area, school bus, etc.), or on the way to or from school. 

Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) Geographic entities defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for use by federal statistical agencies in collecting, tabulating, and publishing federal statistics.

Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both psychological coercion as well as physical force. Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal, anal, or oral penetration by the offender(s). Includes attempts and verbal threats of rape. This category also includes incidents where the penetration is from a foreign object, such as a bottle. 

Robbery Completed or attempted theft, directly from a person, of property or cash by force or threat of force, with or without a weapon, and with or without injury. 

Serious violent victimization Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated assault. 

Sexual assault - A wide range of victimizations, separate from rape or attempted rape. These crimes include attacks or attempted attacks generally involving unwanted sexual contact between the victim and offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve force and includes such things as grabbing or fondling. Sexual assault also includes verbal threats. 

Simple assault - Attack without a weapon resulting either in no injury, minor injury, or an undetermined injury requiring less than 2 days of hospitalization. Also includes attempted assault without a weapon. 

Theft Completed or attempted theft of property or cash without personal contact. 

Victimization - A crime as it affects one individual person or household. For personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. The number of victimizations may be greater than the number of incidents because more than one person may be victimized during an incident. 

Victimization rate - A measure of the occurrence of victimizations among a specific population group. For personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal to the number of victims involved. Each victimization that is reported by the respondents is counted, so there may be one incident with two victims, which would be counted as two victimizations. The number of victimizations may be greater than the number of incidents because more than one person may be victimized during an incident.

Violent victimization Includes serious violent victimization, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or simple assault. 

School Crime Supplement (SCS)

At school In the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or going to or from school. 

Bullied Students were asked if any student had bullied them at school in one or more ways during the school year. Specifically, students were asked if another student had made fun of them, called them names, or insulted them; spread rumors about them; threatened them with harm; pushed, shoved, tripped, or spit on them; forced them to do something they did not want to do; excluded them from activities on purpose; or destroyed their property on purpose. 

Cyber-bullied Students were asked if another student did one or more of the following behaviors anywhere that made them feel bad or were hurtful. Specifically, students were asked about bullying by a peer that occurred anywhere via electronic means, including the Internet, e-mail, instant messaging, text messaging, online gaming, and online communities.

Serious violent victimization Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated assault. 

Total victimization Combination of violent victimization and theft. If a student reported an incident of either type, he or she is counted as having experienced any victimization. If the student reported having experienced both, he or she is counted once under “total victimization.”

Violent victimization Includes serious violent victimization, rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or simple assault.

A teacher at a school that has grade 6 or lower or one that is “ungraded” with no grade higher than the 8th. 

Instructional level Instructional levels divide teachers into elementary or secondary based on a combination of the grades taught, main teaching assignment, and the structure of the teacher’s class(es). Those with only ungraded classes are categorized as elementary level teachers if their main assignment is early childhood/prekindergarten or elementary, or they teach either special education in a self-contained classroom or an elementary enrichment class. All other teachers with ungraded classes are classified as secondary level. Among teachers with regularly graded classes, in general, elementary level teachers teach any of grades prekindergarten through 5th; report an early childhood/prekindergarten, elementary, self-contained special education, or elementary enrichment main assignment; or are those whose preponderance of grades taught are kindergarten through 6th. In general, secondary-level teachers instruct any of grades 7 through 12 but usually no grade lower than 5th. They also teach more of grades 7 through 12 than lower level grades. 

Rural - A territory outside any urbanized area (defined as densely settled “cores” with populations of 50,000 or more of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas) or urban cluster (defined as densely settled “cores” with populations between 25,000 and 50,000 of Census-defined blocks with adjacent densely settled surrounding areas). 

Secondary school - A school in which the lowest grade is greater than or equal to grade 7 and the highest grade is less than or equal to grade 12. 

Secondary school teachers A secondary school teacher is one who, when asked for the grades taught, checked: (1) “ungraded” and was designated as a secondary teacher on the list of teachers provided by the school; (2) 6th grade or lower and 7th grade or higher, and reported a primary assignment other than prekindergarten, kindergarten, or general elementary; (3) 9th grade or higher, or 9th grade or higher and “ungraded”; (4) 7th and 8th grades only, and reported a primary assignment other than prekindergarten, kindergarten, general elementary, or special education; (5) 7th and 8th grades only, and reported a primary assignment of special education and was designated as a secondary teacher on the list of teachers provided by the school; or (6) 6th grade or lower and 7th grade or higher, or 7th and 8th grades only, and was not categorized above as either elementary or secondary.
