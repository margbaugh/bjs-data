40% of State inmates and 48% of Federal inmates age 45 or 
older said they had had a medical problem since admission 
to prison.  This problem may have reflected medical conditions
existing before admission.

*  About a quarter of female inmates and a fifth of male 
inmates reported a medical problem since admission.
------------------------------------------------------------------

In 1997 an estimated 347,000 State and Federal prison inmates reported 
having a physical impairment or mental condition.  Thirty-one percent 
of State inmates and 23% of Federal inmates reported having a learning or
speech disability, a hearing or vision problem, or a mental or physical
condition.  

Based on data from personal interviews, an estimated 318,000 State and 
Federal inmates reported being injured since admission.  Ten percent 
of State inmates and 3% of Federal inmates reported being injured in 
a fight.  About 1 in 5 State and Federal inmates said they had been 
injured in an accident.

Nearly 1 in 6 State inmates reported a medical problem other than a 
cold, an injury, or a problem that had required surgery since admission. 
Specific conditions reported by State inmates included heart (1.1%),
circulatory problems other than heart (2.4%), respiratory problems 
(1.4%), kidney/ liver problems (0.9%), and diabetes (0.9%).  Many
of these conditions may have existed before the inmates' admission
to prison.

The findings in this report are based on the 1997 Survey of Inmates 
in State and Federal Correctional Facilities.  Inmates were asked a 
series of questions related to physical impairments and mental 
conditions that they had, as well as medical problems that they 
had after admission to prison.

State and Federal inmates asked 
to report on physical impairments, 
injuries, and other medical problems

During hour-long personal interviews inmates were asked a series 
of questions related to their physical and mental health.  
(See box below.) As part of an omnibus survey conducted every 5 
to 6 years, these questions provide an opportunity to estimate the 
prevalence of a variety of diseases, illnesses, chronic problems, 
and other health-related conditions of inmates.  

The accuracy of the estimates depends on the ability and willingness 
of inmates to report such problems.  Inmate self-reported data may
underestimate the prevalence of some medical conditions, especially 
those problems that require more sophisticated diagnosis and those 
that are more sensitive in nature. 

For many conditions, inmate self-reports are the only source of 
information.  Most State prison systems lack comprehensive and 
accessible data on the health status of their inmates.   A 1998 
inventory of State and Federal correctional information systems 
found that 20 States had electronic information systems that could 
identify offenders with physical disabilities at time of admission, 
22 had systems that could identify inmates with mental or emotional 
problems, and 22 could identify inmates with specialized medical 
conditions.   Eighteen States had this information electronically 
on current medical conditions for more than 75% of their inmates.  
(See State and Federal Corrections Information Systems, BJS report, 
NCJ 170016.)

In general, medical records are stored in paper form, not 
electronically.  In the 1998 inventory, 10 States reported 
they did not collect data on the current medical condition of 
their inmates, 18 had the data only in paper form, and 5 had 
electronic data on less than 75% of their inmates.  Fewer than 
a third of State corrections departments maintain electronic 
records on the medical treatment of inmates.

In the absence of accessible data on the medical problems of 
inmates, some researchers have estimated the prevalence rates of 
targeted medical conditions from surveys of the health status of 
the civilian non-institutional populations.  For example, a study 
prepared for The National Commission on Correctional Health Care, 
estimated the prevalence rates of asthma, diabetes, hypertension, 
and heart disease in State prisons by applying observed rates among 
civilians in the lowest socioeconomic quartile and adjusting for the 
differing age, gender, and racial distributions of inmates.  
(See Hornung, Greifinger, and Gadre, "A Projection Model of the 
Prevalence of Selected Chronic Diseases in the Inmate Population," 
in The Health Status of Soon-to-be Released Inmates, National 
Institute of Justice, forthcoming).  Though based on in-depth 
major health surveys, physical examinations, and the results of
laboratory tests, such estimates are indirect.

Key survey items on physical
impairments and mental conditions

Items in the 1997 Survey of inmates in State and 
Federal Correctional Facilities include:

Do you have ...       

A physical, mental, or other health condition which              
limits the kind or amount of work you can do?
1 Yes    2 No

Difficulty seeing ordinary newsprint, even when                   
wearing glasses?
1 Yes    2 No

Difficulty hearing a normal conversation, even when           
wearing a hearing aid?
1 Yes    2 No

A learning disability, such as dyslexia or attention               
deficit disorder?
1 Yes    2 No

A speech disability, such as a lisp or stutter?
1 Yes    2 No

A physical disability?
1 Yes    2 No

A mental or emotional condition?
1 Yes    2 No

These questions were adapted from the National Adult Literacy 
Survey (NALS), conducted by the National Center for Education 
Statistics in 1992. (See Methodology.)  The NALS survey provided 
prevalence estimates on both the general population and State and 
Federal prison populations.  Responses of inmates in the 1997 Survey 
of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities were similar 
to those in the NALS survey.

------------------------------------------- 

Nearly a third of State inmates and a 
quarter of Federal inmates reported 
a physical impairment or mental 
condition

In response to questions in the 1997 Survey of Inmates in State 
and Federal Correctional Facilities, 31% of State inmates and 23% 
of Federal inmates said they had a physical impairment or mental 
condition.  About 1 in 5 State and Federal inmates reported having 
some condition that limited their ability to work.

Ten percent of State inmates and 5% of Federal inmates reported a 
learning disability, such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder.  
Among State inmates 4% had a speech disability such as a lisp or 
stutter; among Federal inmates, 2%. 

About 6% of both State and Federal inmates reported difficulty hearing 
a normal conversation even when wearing a hearing aid.  Among both State 
and Federal prisoners about 8% had difficulty seeing ordinary newsprint 
even when wearing glasses.

Ten percent of State prisoners and 5% of Federal prisoners reported 
having a mental or emotional condition.  More than 1 in 10 of both 
State and Federal inmates reported a physical condition.  (For a 
detailed analysis of mental and emotional conditions, see Mental 
Health and Treatment of Inmates and Probationers, BJS Special Report, 
NCJ 174463.)

Rates of speech and vision impairment 
higher among inmates than in the general 
population 

A comparison between the prison population and the general population 
can be made on a selected group of physical impairments including 
speech disabilities, hearing impairments and vision impairments.  The
comparison uses data from Current Estimates from the National Health
Interview Survey, 1996, a report by the National Center for Health 
Statistics. 

The prevalence of speech disabilities among State inmates (3.7%) is 
more than 3 times higher than in the general U.S. population (1.0%).  
The percentage with impaired vision among inmates (8.3%) is more than 
twice as high as in the overall U.S. population (3.1%).  The percentage 
with impaired hearing is lower among inmates (5.7%) than in the U.S.
population (8.3%).

Some of these differences result from differing age and gender 
distributions.  For example, a high percentage of inmates are middle 
age and male.  In addition, juveniles are included in the U.S. population
figures, while less than 1% of State prisoners are under age 18.  For
comparison, the effects of these differences can be taken into account 
by standardizing the general population to resemble the age and gender
distribution of State inmates.

Hearing               8.3          6.6
 
*Age and gender standardized to the State
prison population.
Data source: Current Estimates from the
National Health Interview Survey, 1996,
the National Center for Health Statistics.

Once standardized, rates of speech and vision impairments are still 
higher among inmates.  Overall, an estimated 1.3% of the comparable 
U.S. population is found to have a speech impairment and 3.5% a vision
impairment.  (See Methodology for details on the standardization 
procedure.)   

Older inmates more likely to report 
physical impairments or a mental 
condition

Offenders who were age 45 or older were the most likely to report 
having a physical impairment or mental condition.  Forty-eight percent 
of State inmates and 39% of Federal inmates age 45 or older said they 
had a physical impairment or mental condition compared to 24% of State
prisoners and 14% of Federal prisoners age 24 or younger. 

Among the specific physical impairments, State and Federal inmates 
age 45 or older were more likely than those age 44 or younger to report
difficulty hearing, difficulty seeing, and physical conditions.  Among 
State inmates age 45 or older, 13% reported difficulty hearing, 20% 
reported difficulty seeing, and 25% said they had a physical condition
compared to 3%, 6%, and 5% of those age 24 or younger.

Among Federal inmates age 45 or older, 12% said they had difficulty 
hearing, 15% had difficulty seeing, and 22% reported a physical 
condition. Among those age 24 or younger, 2% said they had difficulty 
hearing, 3% had difficulty seeing, and 2% reported a physical condition.

The prevalence of physical impairments and mental conditions also 
varied by gender.  Female inmates in both State and Federal prisons 
more commonly reported having a physical impairment or mental condition. 
Thirty-four percent of female State inmates and 30% of female Federal 
inmates reported having any condition compared to 31% of male State 
inmates and 23% of male Federal inmates.

More than 1 in 10 State inmates 
reported multiple impairments

An estimated 19% of State inmates and 15% of Federal inmates reported 
having one condition (either a physical impairment or a mental condition). 
Nearly 7% of State prisoners reported two conditions and about 5% 
reported having three or more.  Among Federal inmates, 5% said they 
had two conditions and 3% reported three or more.

Overall, 25% of State inmates and 21% of Federal inmates reported that 
they had multiple impairments or that their impairment limited the kind 
or amount of work they could do.

Key survey items on injuries of inmates since admission

Since your admission have you been injured?
1 Yes    2 No

Were you injured ...

In a fight, assault, or where someone tried to harm you?
   1 Yes    2 No

In an accident, for example, while working or playing sports?
   1 Yes    2 No
-----------------------------------

Over a quarter of State and Federal 
inmates reported being injured 
since admission to prison

In addition to being asked if they had any physical impairments 
or a mental or emotional condition, State and Federal inmates were 
asked if they had been injured in an accident or a fight since 
their admission to prison. 

Overall, an estimated 318,000 State and Federal inmates reported 
being injured since admission: 28% of State inmates and 26% of 
Federal inmates.  About 20% of State inmates and 23% of Federal 
inmates said they had been injured in an accident; 10% and 3%, 
respectively, said they had been injured in a fight.

Among State inmates men (29%) were more likely than women (21%) 
to report being injured since admission.  In Federal prisons about 
a quarter of both male (26%) and female (25%) inmates reported being 
injured.  In both State and Federal prisons male and female inmates 
reported similar rates of being injured by an accident, while males 
in both State and Federal prisons were more likely to report being 
injured in a fight.  About 11% of males in State prisons and 3% of 
males in Federal prisons reported being injured in a fight compared 
to 3% and nearly 1% of females, respectively.

Older inmates in State and Federal prisons were less likely to have 
been injured since their admission.  Among State prisoners age 24 
or younger, 30% had been injured compared to 22% of those age 45 or 
older.  Among Federal prisoners 29% of those age 24 or younger 
compared to 24% of those age 45 or older reported being injured since
admission.  Inmates age 34 or younger in both State and Federal 
prisons were about twice as likely as those age 45 or older to report 
being injured in a fight since admission.

Likelihood of injury increases with 
time served in prison

About 46% of State inmates and about 32% of Federal inmates who had 
served at least 72 months at the time of interview reported an injury 
compared to 13% of State and 17% of Federal inmates who had served 
less than 12 months.

The risk of being injured due to an accident or in a fight increased 
with time served.   About 10% of State inmates and 16% of Federal 
inmates who had served less than 12 months reported being injured 
in an accident, compared to 32% of State inmates and 26% of Federal 
inmates who had served at least 72 months at the time of interview.  

State inmates who had served at least 72 months at the time of 
interview were about 6 times as likely (20%) to report being injured 
in a fight as those who had served less than 12 months (3%), and about 
4 times as likely as those who had served between 12 and 23 months 
(5%).  Among Federal inmates, those who had served at least 72 months 
were 5 times as likely (5%) to report being injured in a fight as 
those who had served less than 12 months (1%). 

Regardless of amount of time served, younger State inmates reported 
higher rates of injury than older inmates.  As the length of time 
served in prison increases, the prevalence of injuries among inmates 
age 34 or younger, inmates age 35-44, and inmates age 45 or older 
increases.  However, while injuries increase in each age group, 
inmates age 45 or older consistently have the lowest rate of injuries 
and those age 34 or younger have the highest.

Men were more likely to have been injured than women, regardless of 
the length of time in prison.  Only among inmates who had served longer 
than 9 years are the percentages reporting an injury higher among women 
than men.

---------------------------------- 
Estimates of injuries among Federal inmates 
based on official data

The Federal Bureau of Prison's medical records provide a 
basis for examining official data of injuries among Federal 
inmates.  A medical professional's diagnosis determines whether 
an inmate is classified as being injured and the type of injury.  
In determining the number of inmates injured, only the first 
injury is counted for those with multiple injuries.  

Among Federal prison inmates, official records show that in 
1999, 3,134 were injured as the result of an assault or a 
fight, and 25,975 were injured while at work, during recrea-
tion, or in some other type of accident.

                     Federal inmates, 1999
Injury                Number    Percent/a
Assault/fight          3,134      2.7 %
Accidental, total     25,975     22.1
Occupational           6,844      5.8
Recreational          11,141      9.5
Accidental, other/b    7,859      6.7

a/Percents are based on the average daily
population.  If they were based on the total that
had spent any time in prison in 1999, the
percents would be lower.
b/BOP distinguishes occupational and recrea-
tional injuries from accidental injuries.
-----------------------------------

Inmates with a physical impairment 
or mental condition were also more 
likely to report an injury

State and Federal inmates with a physical impairment more commonly 
than those without a physical impairment reported being injured in 
an accident since admission.  Among inmates with a physical impairment, 
22% of those in State prisons and 25% of those in Federal prisons 
reported being injured in an accident compared to 19% and 22%, 
respectively, of those without a physical condition.

Inmates in State and Federal prisons who reported having a mental 
condition were more likely than those not reporting a mental condition 
to be injured in a fight since admission.  Nearly 16% of State inmates 
with a mental condition were injured in a fight compared to 10% without 
a mental condition.

Federal inmates who reported a mental condition were about twice as 
likely (6%) as those not reporting a mental condition (3%) to say 
they had been injured in a fight since admission.

Among State inmates those who reported any impairment had higher 
rates of injuries than other inmates, regardless of how long they 
had served in prison. 

Violent offenders more commonly 
reported being injured in a fight 
since admission

Among violent offenders about 14% of those in State prisons and 
9% of those in Federal prisons reported being injured in a fight 
since admission, compared to less than 10% of other State offenders 
and less than 5% of other Federal offenders.

had higher rates of fight-related injuries than other inmates.   
Among State inmates who had served less than 12 months, 4% of violent
offenders reported having been injured in a fight, compared to 3% of
nonviolent offenders.  However, among State inmates who had served at 
least 72 months, 22% of violent inmates said they had been injured in 
a fight compared to 13% of nonviolent inmates. 

About 22% of State inmates will be
injured while in prison

The survey data also provide an estimate of an incoming inmate's 
risk of injury while in prison.  Assuming that incoming inmates 
will experience the same chances of being injured as those in prison 
at time of the survey, nearly 22% of entering State inmates are 
expected to be injured while in prison.  Overall, 7% of entering 
State inmates are expected to be injured in a fight while in prison.

The likelihood that an incoming inmate will be injured at some time 
before being released is estimated based on the increasing percentage 
of inmates who reported an injury while in prison.   By weighting each
reported percentage injured within categories of time served by the 
percent of inmates who are expected to serve the specified amount of 
time and then summing these weights, we have calculated a weighted 
average.  This average represents the overall risk of inmates being 
injured at some time while in prison.

*Based on data for inmates admitted in the
6 months prior to the 1997 Survey of inmates
in State Correctional Facilities.

More than 1 in 5 inmates in State 
and Federal prisons reported a 
medical problem excluding injury 
since admission

Based on additional health-related questions asked of inmates, 
more than 20% of both State and Federal inmates said they had 
experienced a medical problem other than an injury since their 
admission to prison.  This problem may have reflected medical 
conditions existing before admission.  Among State inmates nearly 
8% reported a medical problem that required surgery, and 17%     
reported some other medical problem.  Among Federal inmates 
about 10% reported having a problem that required surgery, and 
16% said they had some other medical problem.

The percentage of inmates who reported requiring surgery or a 
specific medical problem since admission increased with the time 
served in prison. State prisoners who had served at least 72 months 
were about 5 times as likely to have had a medical problem that 
required surgery and about 2 times as likely to have had a medical 
problem excluding injury than those who had served less than 12 
months.  Among Federal inmates who had served 72 or more months at 
the time of interview, 18% had required surgery, and 19% had other 
medical problems, compared to 4% and 14% of those who had served 
less than 12 months.

As with injuries, these reports may be used to calculate the 
likelihood of incoming inmates requiring surgery at some time before 
being released from prison.  Assuming that incoming inmates will 
experience the same needs for surgery and have the same incidence 
of medical problems as those in prison at the time of the survey, 
nearly 6% of all entering State inmates are expected to need surgery 
while in prison.  In addition, nearly 16% of entering State inmates 
will experience some other medical problem, besides an injury, a 
cold, virus, or flu, while in prison.  (See Methodology for 
calculations.)

The 1997 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional 
Facilities also included items on medical problems other 
than physical impairments, mental or emotional problems, 
and injuries since admission to prison.

----------------------------------

Reported medical problems highest 
among older, female inmates 

Twenty-seven percent of female State inmates and 30% of female 
Federal inmates reported a medical problem since admission 
(excluding injuries, colds, viruses, and flu) compared to 21% 
of male State and Federal inmates.  In both State and Federal 
prison, men and women were equally likely to report having a 
medical problem that required surgery since their admission.  
A higher percentage of female inmates reported other medical 
problems since admission.  Among female inmates  23% of 
State prisoners and 25% of Federal prisoners reported some 
other medical problem compared to 16% of male State inmates and 
15% of male Federal inmates.  

Older inmates in both State and Federal prisons more commonly 
reported medical problems requiring surgery and other medical 
problems since admission.  Among those in State prison 45 or older, 
40% reported a medical problem, compared to 12% of those 24 or 
younger.  Among State inmates 45 or older, 16% reported having a 
medical problem that required surgery (compared to 3% of the younger 
inmates) and 32% said they had some other medical problem (compared 
to 10%).  Among Federal inmates age 45 or older, 37% reported a 
medical problem, 18% said they had a medical problem that required 
surgery and 29% reported some other medical problem.  

About 1 in 6 State and Federal 
inmates reported a medical problem 
other than a cold, injury, or surgery

Inmates were asked to specify medical problems that they have 
had since admission to prison.  The most commonly reported 
medical problems were then grouped into categories, including 
HIV/AIDS, heart problems, circulatory problems other than heart, 
cancer, kidney/liver problems, respiratory problems, neurological 
problems, skeletal problems, and diabetes. 

Among State and Federal inmates the most commonly reported 
problems since admission were skeletal and circulatory other 
than heart.  Skeletal problems were reported by 2.6% of State 
inmates and 3.1% of Federal inmates, and 2.4% of both State and 
Federal inmates said they had a circulatory problem other than 
heart. 

Other medical problems reported by State and Federal inmates 
included heart problems (1.1% and 1.3%), cancer (0.2% and 0.3%), 
diabetes (0.9% and 1.5%), HIV/AIDS (1.7% and 0.5%), kidney/liver 
problems (0.9% and 1.4%), respiratory problems (1.4% and 1.2%), 
and neurological problems (0.7% and 0.4%). 

-----------------------------------
Comparing estimates based on self-reported 
data to official records

The Federal Bureau of Prison's Sensitive Medical Data,
which contain information on the clinical status of
every inmate, provide an independent source of 
information.  Upon indication of a problem during
a medical screening, Federal inmates are required
to participate in a medical clinic and to see
medical staff on a regular basis.
 
Counts of the current clinical status of inmates reveal 
significantly higher rates than determined by inmate self-
reports.  At midyear 2000, the Federal system  had 5,639 
inmates with asthma (4.4% of all Federal inmates); 4,616 
inmates in a diabetic clinic (3.6%); 3,358 in a cardiac 
clinic (2.6%); 10,011 in a hypertension clinic (7.8%, 
and 6,151 in a mental health clinic (4.8%).
 
Though collected at different times, survey and official
data suggest a range for the prevalence of specific 
problems.  Official records based on clinical schedules 
provide a high estimate, since the records contain a
description of the original problem but not the final
diagnosis.  Inmates may provide a low estimate due to
a lack of understanding or unwillingness to report.

-------------------------------------- 

Medical problems more prevalent 
among inmates who had been 
homeless or unemployed

Of State inmates who reported a period of being homeless or 
living in a shelter in the year before their arrest, nearly half 
reported a physical impairment or mental condition and about a 
third said they had a medical problem (excluding injury) since 
admission, compared to 29% and 26% of those who were not homeless. 

State inmates who reported being homeless at the time of their 
arrest reported higher rates of medical problems and physical 
impairments or mental conditions than other inmates.  Thirty-five 
percent of State inmates who were homeless when arrested reported 
a medical problem excluding injury since admission compared to 
27% of those who were not homeless.  Half of State inmates who 
reported being homeless at the time of the arrest (51%) reported 
having a physical impairment or mental condition.  Among State 
inmates who were not homeless at time of arrest, 31% said they 
had a physical impairment or mental condition. 

Medical problems and physical impairments or mental conditions 
were also more prevalent among inmates who reported being 
unemployed before their arrest and among inmates who were 
receiving government assistance. Nearly 35% of State inmates 
who were unemployed in the month prior to their arrest, compared 
to 29% of those who were employed, reported having a physical 
impairment or mental condition. Inmates who were unemployed 
(27%) were as likely as those who were employed to report having 
a medical problem (excluding injury).

More than 1 in 3 of State inmates who received financial support 
from government agencies in the month prior to arrest reported a 
medical problem since admission.  More than a quarter of State 
inmates who received income from wages reported a medical problem.  

Among inmates who reported receiving income from government 
agencies, 52% of those in State prisons reported having a 
physical impairment or mental condition; among of those who 
reported receiving wages, 29%. 

Medical problems more common 
among inmates who had used a 
needle to inject drugs and those 
who were alcohol dependent

An estimated 32% of State inmates who reported ever using a needle 
to inject drugs said they had a medical problem (excluding injury) 
since admission to prison, compared to 25% of those who did not use 
a needle.

Inmates who reported ever using a needle to inject drugs reported a 
higher prevalence of physical impairments or mental conditions.  
Among State prisoners, about 36% of those who used a needle and 30% 
of those who did not use a needle to inject drugs reported having 
some physical impairment or mental condition. 

Overall, State inmates who reported a history of drug abuse were 
as likely as those who said they never used drugs to report having 
a medical problem since admission and to report having a physical 
impairment or mental condition.

Nearly 38% of State inmates who were alcohol dependent reported 
having a physical impairment or mental condition, compared to 29% 
of those who were not alcohol dependent.  Based on the CAGE 
diagnostic inmates are considered alcohol dependent if they answer 
yes to three or more of the following questions:  ever attempt to 
cut back on drinking, ever annoyed by others' criticism of your 
drinking, ever felt guilty about drinking, and ever drink first 
thing in the morning? 

-------------------------------------
Summary of medical services provided 
to State prisoners

Inmates were asked questions on medical services provided by 
the prison facility at the time of admission and since admission.  
More than 8 out of 10 State inmates reported having a medical 
exam since being admitted to prison.  Nearly 60% of State 
inmates reported being checked by staff to see if they were sick, 
injured or intoxicated at time of admission; about 82% were asked 
questions about their health or medical history.  The medical 
services provided at admission to those inmates who reported later 
medical problems did not differ from that given to inmates with no 
reported medical problems.

Among State inmates who reported any medical problem since 
admission to prison, 91% reported visiting a health care 
professional because of their medical problem.  Among inmates 
who had been injured, 87% reported seeing a health care 
professional, as did 96% of those who said they had a problem 
that required surgery.

Methodology

Survey of Inmates in State and Federal 
Correctional Facilities, 1997

Data in this report are based primarily on personal interviews 
with State and Federal inmates.  In the 1997 Surveys of Inmates 
in State and Federal Correctional Facilities, offenders were 
randomly selected from a nationally representative sample of 
facilities and were asked questions regarding their current 
offense and sentence, criminal history, personal and family 
back-ground, physical impairment and mental condition, and 
medical problems since admission to prison.

Detailed descriptions of the methodology and sample design 
can be found in Substance Abuse and Treatment of State and 
Federal Prisoners, 1997, BJS Special Report, NCJ 172871.

Accuracy of the survey estimates

The accuracy of the survey estimates presented in this 
report depends on two types of error:  sampling and 
nonsampling.  Sampling error is the variation that may occur 
by chance because a sample rather than a complete numeration 
of the population was conducted.  Nonsampling error can be 
attributed to many sources, such as nonresponses, differences 
in the interpretation of questions among inmates, recall 
difficulties, and processing errors.  In any survey the full 
extent of the nonsampling error is never known.  

The sampling error, as measured by an estimated standard error, 
varies by the size of the estimate and the size of the base 
population.  Estimates of the standard errors for selected 
characteristics have been calculated for 1997 Surveys of 
Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities (see 
appendix tables).  These standard errors may be used to construct 
confidence intervals around estimated percentages.  For example, 
the 95%-confidence interval around the percentage of State prison 
inmates who reported having any physical impairment or mental 
condition is approximately 31.0% plus or minus 1.96 times 0.50% 
(or 30.0% to 32.0%).

These standard errors may also be used to test the statistical 
significance of the difference between two sample statistics by 
pooling the standard errors of the two sample estimates.  For 
example, the standard error of the difference between male and 
female State inmates who report having a physical impairment or 
mental condition would be .59% (or the square root of the sum of 
the squared standard errors for each group).  The 95%-confidence 
interval around the difference would be 1.96 times .59% (or 1.2%).  
Since the difference of 3.7% (34.4% minus 30.7%) is greater than 
1.2%, the difference would be considered statistically significant.

National Adult Literacy Survey, 1992

Questions on physical impairments and mental conditions in the 
BJS surveys were adapted from the National Adult Literacy Survey, 
conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics in 1992.  
Interviews were completed with nearly 1,150 inmates in 80 State 
and Federal prisons and a nationally representative sample of about 
13,600 adults age 16 and older.  Both prisons and inmates were 
randomly selected to be representative of prisons across the 
country.  (For an overview of the survey design, statistical 
procedures, and other findings, see Literacy Behind Prison Walls, 
National Center for Education Statistics, Washington, DC, 
October 1994.)

National Health Interview Survey, 1996

To compare the prevalence of medical problems among inmates with 
the prevalence of medical problems in the general U.S. population, 
data were drawn from the National Health Interview Survey, 1996. 
(See Current Estimates From the National Health Interview Survey, 
1996, National Center for Health Statistics, PHS 99-1528, October 
1999). The survey, conducted yearly, is based on in-home interviews 
of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population.  Estimates 
were provided on, but were not limited to, prevalence of chronic 
conditions.  For purposes of the survey, chronic conditions 
were defined as conditions that had been first noticed 3 or 
more months prior to the interview or belong to a group of 
conditions that are considered chronic regardless of onset.
 
Comparisons with the general U.S. population are sharply 
affected by differences in the demographic characteristics 
of State and Federal inmates, who are disproportionately male 
and middle-aged.  To control for these differences, estimates 
of the percentage of the U.S. population with selected physical 
impairments were calculated by standardizing the general 
population to resemble the age and gender distribution of State 
inmates.

Age-standardized rates for males were calculated by multiplying 
the rate of males in the general population reporting a physical 
impairment within specified age groups by the proportion of male 
State prisoners in each respective age group and then summing.  
The same was done for females in the general population.  To 
calculate the overall age and gender standardized rate, the 
age-standardized rate for males was then multiplied by the 
proportion of males in State prisons and added to the result 
of the age-standardized rate for females multiplied by the 
proportion of females in State prisons.

Estimating the likelihood that an inmate 
will be injured or will require surgery 
at some time while in prison

Prevalence rates may be used to estimate the likelihood that 
inmates will be injured or require surgery at some time prior 
to their release.  Such estimates assume that incoming inmates 
will experience the same chances of injury or the same need for 
surgery as those in prison at the time of the interview. 

For example, the expected need for surgery among incoming inmates 
(5.8%) was estimated by weighting each reported percent requiring 
surgery within categories of time served by the percent of inmates 
who are expected to serve the specified amount of time and then 
summing.
