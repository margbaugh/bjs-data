2001.

*  The 159 inmates received under sentence of death represent the 
smallest number of admissions since 1973. 

*  The 364 Hispanic inmates under sentence of death accounted for 
12% of inmates with a known ethnicity.

*  At yearend the youngest death-row inmate was 18; the oldest was 
87.

*  Fifty-one women were under sentence of death in 2002, up from

*  The number of States authorizing lethal injection increased 
from 22 in 1992 to 37 in 2002.  In 2002, 99% of executions were 
by lethal injection, compared to two-thirds in 1992.

*  Since 1977, 654 of the 820 executions (80%) were by lethal 
injection.
------------------------------------------------------------

Thirteen States executed 71 prisoners during 2002. The
number executed was 5 greater than in 2001. Those 
executed during 2002 had been under sentence of death
an average of 10 years and 7 months, 15 months less
than that for inmates executed in 2001.

At yearend 2002, 3,557 prisoners were under sentence of
death. California held the largest number on death row
(614), followed by Texas (450), Florida (366), and
Pennsylvania (241). Twenty-four people were under a
Federal death sentence.

During 2002, 27 States and the Federal prison system
received 159 prisoners under sentence of death.  Texas
(37 admissions), California (14), Alabama (11), Florida
(10), and Pennsylvania (9) accounted for more than half
of those sentenced in 2002.

During 2002, 69 men and 2 women were executed: 53 whites and 
18 blacks. The executed inmates included 6 Hispanics (all 
white).  Seventy were carried out by lethal injection; one
by electrocution.

From January 1, 1977, to December 31, 2002, 820 inmates were 
executed by 32 States and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Two-
thirds of the executions occurred in 5 States: Texas (289), 
Virginia (87), Missouri (59), Oklahoma (55), and Florida (54).

Capital punishment laws

At yearend 2002 the death penalty was authorized by 38
States and the Federal Government. No State enacted
new legislation authorizing capital punishment in 2002.

The United States Supreme Court struck a portion of the
Arizona capital punishment statutes on June 24, 2002
(Ring v. Arizona, 122 S. Ct. 2428 (2002)). The Court found
that allowing a judge, rather than a jury, to decide the
presence of aggravating factors violates a defendant's
Sixth Amendment right to a trial by a jury.

Statutory changes

During 2002, 11 States revised statutory provisions
relating to the death penalty. By State, the changes were
as follows:

Alabama -- Authorized lethal injection as a method of
execution, effective 7/1/2002. An inmate may elect in
writing to be executed by electrocution within 30 days of
the date of sentence.  The statute also mandates that a
death sentence will not be reduced if the method of
execution is found to be unconstitutional (Ala. Code sec
15-18-82). 

Arizona -- Revised the capital statute to allow a jury to
sentence a defendant to death by a unanimous decision
when finding of at least one aggravating circumstance
(A.R.S. 13-703.01), effective 8/1/2002. 

Colorado -- Revised its code of criminal procedure to allow
determination of a death sentence by unanimous jury
decisions rather than by 3-judge panels (C.R.S.
18-1.3-1201), effective 7/12/2002.  

Delaware -- Amended its code of criminal procedure to
allow juries to decide the existence of aggravating
circumstances. If a jury is unable to unanimously find the
presence of an aggravating factor, a judge cannot override
that verdict and the defendant may not be sentenced to
death (Del. Code 11 sec 4209(c)(3), (d)(1)).

Delaware also prohibited imposition of a death sentence
on any defendant found by the trial judge to be "seriously
mentally retarded" and setting forth procedures for such a
determination (Del. Code 11 sec 4209(d)(3)).  Both
changes were effective 7/22/2002.

Indiana -- Raised the minimum age of eligibility for a death
sentence from 16 to 18 years of age at the time the murder was 
committed (IC 35-50-2-3).

Indiana also revised portions of its statutes to require
submission of a separate verdict form for each aggravating 
circumstance alleged by the State. Revisions were also 
approved preventing a sentencing judge from overriding a jury's 
unanimous verdict in the sentencing phase of a capital trial 
to sentence a defendant to death or life without parole 
(IC 35-50-2-9). These changes became effective 7/1/2002.

Nebraska -- Changed its sentencing procedures to allow juries to 
unanimously decide the existence or nonexistence of aggravating 
circumstances (Neb. sec 29-2519 to 29-2522), effective 11/23/2002.

New Jersey -- Expanded the definition of felony murder to
include acts of terrorism resulting in death (N.J.S.A
2C:11-3c), effective 6/18/2002.

Oklahoma -- Added to the definition of first degree murder
terrorist acts resulting in death. Terrorist acts include any
"act of violence resulting in damage to property or
personal injury perpetrated to coerce a civilian population
or government into granting illegal political or economic
demands" (Okla. Stat. Ann. 21 sec 1268), effective
6/6/2002. 

Tennessee -- Added to its definition of felony murder
"killing of another in the perpetration of ... acts of 
terrorism" (Tenn. Code Ann. sec 39-13-202(a)(2)) and to its 
list of aggravating circumstances murder committed in the
course of an act of terrorism (Tenn. Code Ann. sec
39-13-204(i)(15)), effective 7/4/2002.

Utah -- Amended its statute to include as a mitigating
factor diminished mental capacity as a result of retardation
(Utah Code Ann. sec 76-3-207), effective 5/6/2002.

Virginia -- Added as an aggravating factor deliberate
killing of any person in the commission of an act of
terrorism (Va. Code sec 18.2-31(13)), effective 7/1/2002.

Automatic review
  
Of the 38 States with capital statutes at yearend, 37
provided for review of all death sentences regardless of
the defendant's wishes. In South Carolina the defendant
had the right to waive sentence review if he or she was
deemed competent by the court (State v. Torrence, 473
S.E. 3d 703 (S.C. 1996)). Federal death penalty
procedures did not provide for automatic review after a
sentence of death had been imposed.

The State's highest appellate court usually conducted the
review. If either the conviction or sentence were vacated,
the case could be remanded to the trial court for additional
proceedings or retrial. As a result of retrial or
resentencing, a death sentence could be reimposed.

While most of the 37 States authorized an automatic review of 
both the conviction and sentence, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, 
Oklahoma, and Tennessee required review of the sentence only. In 
Idaho review of the conviction had to be filed through appeal or 
forfeited. In Indiana and Kentucky a defendant could waive review 
of the conviction.

In Virginia a defendant could waive an appeal of trial court
error but could not waive review of the death sentence for
arbitrariness and proportionality. In Mississippi the
question of whether the defendant could waive the right to
automatic review had not been addressed. In Wyoming
neither statute nor case law precluded a waiver of appeal. 

Arkansas rule requires review of specific issues relating to
both capital convictions and sentences (Ark. R. App. P. --
Crim 10). Recent case law held waivers of this review are
not permitted (Newman v. State, No. CR02-811, 2002
Westlaw 31030906 (Ark. Sept. 12, 2002)). 

Method of execution

As of December 31, 2002, lethal injection was the
predominant method of execution (37 States).

Nine States authorized electrocution; four States, lethal
gas; three States, hanging; and three States, firing squad.

Seventeen States authorized more than 1 method   lethal injection 
and an alternative method -- generally at the election of the 
condemned prisoner; however, 5 of these 17 stipulated which 
method must be used depending on the date of sentencing; 1 
authorized hanging only if lethal injection could not be given; 
and if lethal injection is ever ruled to be unconstitutional, 1 
authorized lethal gas, and 1 authorized electrocution or firing 
squad.

The method of execution of Federal prisoners is lethal
injection, pursuant to 28 CFR, Part 26. For offenses under
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of
1994, the method is that of the State in which the
conviction took place, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3596.

Minimum age

In 2002 seven jurisdictions did not specify a minimum age
for which the death penalty could be imposed.  

In some States the minimum age was set forth in the
statutory provisions that determine the age at which a
juvenile may be transferred to adult court for trial as an
adult. Fifteen States and the Federal system required a
minimum age of 18. Sixteen States indicated an age of
eligibility between 14 and 17.

Characteristics of prisoners under sentence 
of death at yearend 2002

Thirty-seven States and the Federal prison system held a
total of 3,557 prisoners under sentence of death on
December 31, 2002, a decrease of 20 since the end of
2001. This decrease during 2002 marks the second
consecutive year that the number of prisoners under a
death sentence at yearend declined. Since December 31,
2000, the number under sentence of death decreased
from 3,601 to 3,557.
       
Three States reported 40% of the Nation's death row
population: California (614), Texas (450), and Florida
(366). The Federal Bureau of Prisons held 24 inmates at
yearend. Of the 39 jurisdictions authorizing the death
penalty in 2002, New Hampshire had no one under a
capital sentence, and New York, Kansas, South Dakota,
Colorado, New Mexico, and Wyoming had 5 or fewer.

Among the 38 jurisdictions with prisoners under sentence
of death at yearend 2002, 9 had more inmates than a year
earlier, 14 had fewer inmates, and 15 had the same
number. California had an increase of 9, followed by
Alabama and the Federal system (5 each). The largest
decreases were in North Carolina (9), Florida (7), and
Missouri (6).

During 2002 the number of white inmates under sentence
of death declined by 37; the number of blacks increased
by 16; and the number of persons of other races (including
American Indians, Asians, and self-identified Hispanics)
rose from 71 to 72.

Men were 99% (3,506) of all prisoners under sentence of
death.  Whites comprised 54%; blacks comprised 44%;
and other races (2%) included 27 American Indians, 33
Asians, and 12 persons of unknown race. Among those
for whom ethnicity was known, 12% were Hispanic.  

During 2002 the number of women sentenced to be executed 
remained at 51. Five women were received under sentence of 
death, three were removed from death row, and two were 
executed. Women were under sentence of death in 16 States.
Nearly three-quarters of women on death row at yearend
were in five States: California, Texas, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, and Illinois.

The number of Hispanics under sentence of death rose
from 361 to 364 during 2002. Eighteen Hispanics were
received under sentence of death, 9 were removed from
death row, and 6 were executed. Nearly three-quarters of
the Hispanics were held in 3 States: California (126),
Texas (114), and Florida (29).

The gender, race, and Hispanic origin of those under
sentence of death at yearend 2002 were as follows:

Among all inmates under sentence of death for whom date
of arrest information was available, about half were age 
20 to 29 at the time of arrest for their capital offense; 
13% were age 19 or younger; and less than 1% were age 55 or
older. The average age at time of arrest was 28 years. On
December 31, 2002, 34% of all inmates were age 30 to 39, and 
67% were age 25 to 44. The youngest offender under sentence 
of death was 18; the oldest was 87.

Criminal history of inmates under sentence 
of death in 2002

Among inmates under a death sentence on December 31, 2002, 
for whom criminal history information was available, 64% 
had prior felony convictions, including 8% with at least 
one previous homicide conviction.

Among those for whom legal status at the time of the capital 
offense was available, 40% had an active criminal justice 
status. Less than half of these were on parole, and a quarter 
were on probation. The remaining quarter had charges pending, 
were incarcerated, had escaped from incarceration, or had some 
other criminal justice status.

Criminal history patterns differed by race and Hispanic
origin. More blacks (69%) than whites (62%) or Hispanics
(58%) had a prior felony conviction. About the same
percentage of whites, blacks, and Hispanics had a prior
homicide conviction (8%). A slightly higher percentage of
Hispanics (23%) or blacks (18%) than whites (15%) were
on parole when arrested for their capital offense.

Since 1988, data have been collected on the number of
death sentences imposed on entering inmates. Among the
4,005 individuals received under sentence of death during
that time, about 1 in 7 entered with 2 or more death
sentences.

Entries and removals of persons under 
sentence of death
   
Between January 1 and December 31, 2002, 27 State prison 
systems reported receiving 154 inmates under sentence of 
death; the Federal Bureau of Prisons received 5 inmates. 
More than half of the inmates were received in 5 States: 
Texas (37), California (14), Alabama (11), Florida (10), 
and Pennsylvania (9).

All 159 prisoners who were received under sentence of
death had been convicted of murder; 5 were female.  By
race, 83 were white, 73 were black, 2 were Asian, and 1
was an American Indian. Of the 159 new admissions, 18
were Hispanic.

The 159 admissions to death row in 2002 marked a further
decline from the 163 admissions recorded in 2001, and
represented the smallest number received in a year since
44 persons were admitted in 1973. Between 1994 and
2000, in contrast, an average 297 inmates per year were
admitted.

Twenty-six States reported 83 persons whose death
sentences were removed or overturned. Appeals courts
vacated 40 sentences while upholding the convictions and
vacated 32 sentences while overturning the convictions. 
Florida and North Carolina each had 12 capital sentences
vacated, more than any other State. In Florida, six had
their sentences overturned, and six had their convictions
overturned. In North Carolina, one death sentence was
commuted, six death sentences were vacated, and five
convictions were overturned.

Pennsylvania reported five commutations of death
sentences; Texas reported two; and Georgia, Nevada,
and Ohio each reported one. 

As of December 31, 2002, 43 of 83 persons who were
formerly under sentence of death were serving a life
sentence. One inmate had been resentenced to 65 years;
one to 60 years; and two others to 30 years. Seventeen
inmates were awaiting a new trial, 11 were awaiting
resentencing, and 2 had all capital charges dropped. No
action had yet been taken in the case of one inmate
removed from under sentence of death. The current status
of five inmates was not available.

In addition, 25 persons died while under sentence of death
in 2002.  Twenty-one of these deaths were from natural
causes -- 3 each in Illinois and Texas; 2 each in Florida,
Nevada, and North Carolina; and 1 each in Arizona, California, 
Colorado, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Ohio, Oklahoma, and 
Pennsylvania. Three of these deaths were suicides -- one each 
in Alabama, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. One of these deaths, 
in Indiana, was the result of a murder by another inmate.  

From 1977, the year after the Supreme Court upheld the
constitutionality of revised State capital punishment laws,
to 2002, a total of 6,532 persons entered prison under
sentence of death. During these 26 years, 820 persons
were executed, and 2,535 were removed from under a
death sentence by appellate court decisions and reviews,
commutations, or death.***Footnote 1: An individual may have
been received and removed from under sentence of death more
than once. Data are based on the most recent sentence.***

Among individuals who received a death sentence between 1977 
and 2002, 3,189 (49%) were white, 2,679 (41%) were black, 558 
(8%) were Hispanic, and 106 (2%)were other races. The distribution 
by race and Hispanic origin of the 3,355 inmates who were removed 
from death row between 1977 and 2002 was as follows: 1,777 whites
(53%), 1,320 blacks (39%), 209 Hispanics (6%), and 49 persons of 
other races (1%). Of the 820 who were executed, 469 (57%) were 
white, 281 (34%) were black, 58 (7%) were Hispanic, and 12 (2%) 
were of other races.

Executions

According to data collected by the Federal Government, from 1930 
to 2002, 4,679 persons were executed under civil authority.
***Footnote 2: Military authorities carried out an additional 160
executions between 1930 and 1961.***

After the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, 32 
States and the Federal Government executed 820 prisoners:

During this 26-year period, 5 States executed 544 prisoners: Texas 
(289), Virginia (87), Missouri (59), Oklahoma (55), and Florida (54). 
These States accounted for two-thirds of all executions. Between 
1977 and 2002, 460 white non-Hispanic men, 280 black non-Hispanic
men, 58 Hispanic men, 7 American Indian men, 5 Asian men, 9 white 
non-Hispanic women, and 1 black non-Hispanic woman were executed.
    
During 2002 Texas carried out 33 executions, Oklahoma executed 7 
persons; Missouri, 6; Georgia and Virginia, 4 each; Ohio, Florida, 
and South Carolina, 3 each; Alabama, Mississippi, and North Carolina, 
2 each; California and Louisiana, 1 each.  Sixty-nine of the persons 
executed in 2002 were male and 2 were female.  Forty-seven were
white; 18 were black; and 6 were Hispanic.

From 1977 to 2002, 6,912 prisoners were under death sentences for 
varying lengths of time. The 820 executions accounted for 12% of 
those at risk. A total of 2,535 prisoners (37% of those at risk) 
were removed by means other than execution. About the same 
percentage of whites (14%), blacks (10%), and Hispanics (10%) were
executed. Somewhat larger percentages of whites (39%)and blacks 
(36%)than Hispanics (26%) were removed from under a death sentence 
by means other than execution.

Among prisoners executed from 1977 to 2002, the average time spent 
between the imposition of the most recent sentence received and 
execution was more than 10 years.  White prisoners had spent an 
average of 9 years and 11 months, and black prisoners, 10 years and 
10 months.  The 71 prisoners executed in 2002 were under sentence of 
death an average of 10 years and 7 months.

For the 820 prisoners executed between 1977 and 2002, the most 
common method of execution was lethal injection (654). Other 
methods were electrocution (150), lethal gas (11), hanging (3), 
and firing squad (2).

Among prisoners under sentence of death at yearend 2002, the 
average time spent in prison was 9 years and 1 month, up 6 
months from that in 2001.

The median time between the imposition of a death sentence and 
yearend 2002 was 97 months. Overall, the average time for women 
was 6 years and 11 months, 27 months less than that for men (9 
years and 2 months).  On average, whites, blacks, and Hispanics 
had spent from 95 to 113 months under a sentence of death. 

----------------------------------------------
Advance count of executions:  January 1, 2003 --
December 31, 2003

To provide the latest data on capital punishment, BJS
gathers information following each execution. The data
include the date of execution, the jurisdiction, method
used, and the name, race, and gender of each person
executed.

During 2003, 11 States and the Federal Government executed 
65 inmates. This is six fewer than the number executed in 
2002.

Two States accounted for more that half of the executions 
carried out during this period: Texas carried out 24, and 
Oklahoma carried out 14.

Lethal injection accounted for 64 of the executions; 
electrocution, for 1.

Forty-four of those executed were white, 20 were black,
and 1 was American Indian. No women were executed. 

Final counts for 2003 will appear in Capital Punishment
2003, released in late 2004. This annual report will
comprise data collected from State and Federal
correctional agencies.  The report will cover all persons
under sentence of death on December 31, 2003, as well
as those removed from under sentence of death.
----------------------------------------------

Methodology

Capital punishment information is collected annually as
part of the National Prisoner Statistics program (NPS-8).
This data series is collected in two parts: data on persons
under sentence of death are obtained from the department
of corrections in each jurisdiction currently authorizing
capital punishment; and information on the status of death
penalty statutes is obtained from the Office of the Attorney
General in each of the 50 States, the District of Columbia,
and the Federal Government. Data collection forms and
more detailed tables are available on the BJS website
<www.ojp.usdoj. gov/bjs/abstract/cp02.htm> and in the 
Correctional Populations in the United States -- Statistical
Tables, also on the website.  NPS-8 covers all persons
under sentence of death at any time during the year who
were held in a State or Federal nonmilitary correctional
facility.  Included are capital offenders transferred from
prison to mental hospitals and those who may have escaped from 
custody. Excluded are persons whose death sentences have been 
overturned by the court, regardless of their current incarceration 
status.

The statistics reported in this Bulletin may differ from data
collected by other organizations for a variety of reasons: 
(1) NPS-8 adds inmates to the population under sentence
of death not at sentencing but at the time they are admitted 
to a State or Federal correctional facility; (2) If inmates 
entered prison under a death sentence or were reported as being 
relieved of a death sentence in one year but the court had acted 
in the previous year, the counts are adjusted to reflect the 
dates of court decisions (see the note on table 4 for the 
affected jurisdictions); (3) NPS counts are always for the last 
day of the calendar year and will differ from counts for more 
recent periods.

All data in this report have been reviewed for accuracy by
the data providers in each jurisdiction prior to publication.
