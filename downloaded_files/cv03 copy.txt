Highlights

The National Crime Victimization Survey reveals that violent and 
property crime rates in 2003 did not change from the previous year

*  Though the downward trend in crime rates has stabilized, violent 
and property crime rates in 2003 remained at the lowest levels 
recorded since the survey's inception in 1973.

*  Rates for robbery and assault did not change in 2002-03, while the 
rate for rape/sexual assault declined marginally. 

*  The rate of violent crime dropped 14% from the period 2000-01 to the
period 2002-03.

*  For the decade the rate for crimes of violence was down 55%, from 50
to 23 victimizations per 1,000 persons.

*  During 2003, 24% of all violent crime incidents were committed by an
armed offender; 7%, by an offender with a firearm.

*  As in previous years, males were most vulnerable to violence by
strangers (54% of the violence against males), while females were most
often victimized by nonstrangers (67%).

*  Persons who have been historically the most vulnerable to violent crime
-- males, blacks, and youths -- continued to be victimized at higher
rates than others in 2003.

*  During 2003, 48% of all violent victimizations and 38% of all property
crimes were reported to the police -- representing significant increases
in reporting to the police over the last decade.
---------------------------------------------
                     
In 2003 U.S. residents age 12 or older experienced an estimated 24.2
million violent and property victimizations, according to the National
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). (See Survey methodology, page
11.) These criminal victimizations included an estimated 18.6 million
property crimes (burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft), 5.4 million
violent crimes (rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and
simple assault), and 185,000 personal thefts (pocket picking and purse
snatching).

Except for rape/sexual assault, which showed a marginal decline, 2003
victimization rates for every major type of crime measured were
unchanged from their 2002 levels. However, for every major category of
crime except rape/sexual assault, aggregated rates for the period
2002-03 were lower than those for 2001-02.

Taken together, the 1-year (2002-03) and 2-year average (2000-01 to
2002-03) change estimates indicate that crime rates have stabilized. The
rates are the lowest experienced in the last 30 years.

Between 1993 and 2003 the violent crime rate decreased 55%, from 50
to 23 victimizations per 1,000 persons  age 12 or older. Property crime
declined 49% from 319 to 163 per 1,000 households. 

In 2003, according to victims, 48% of violent crimes and 38% of property
crimes were reported to the police. The proportion of crime reported to
the police has increased since 1993, when victims indicated that 43% of
the violent crimes and 34% of the property crimes had been reported.

Criminal victimization, 2002-03

The NCVS collects data on nonfatal crimes against persons age 12 or
older, reported and not reported to the police, from a nationally
representative sample of U.S. households. Information on homicide is
obtained from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program of the FBI.

Crimes measured by the NCVS

Violent crimes refer to rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, and simple assault taken as a whole. Property crimes refer to
household burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft considered together.

The violent and property crime rates remained stable, 2002-03, and the
rates for individual types of violence did not change, except for
rape/sexual assault, the rates of which decreased marginally. 

Murder/nonnegligent manslaughter

Based on preliminary 2003 data from the FBI, the number of persons
murdered in the United States increased 1.3% between 2002 and 2003.
In 2002, 16,200 persons were murdered; the estimate for 2003 is about
16,420 victims of murder. Based on these preliminary data, the homicide
rate for 2003 is about 5.6 per 100,000 persons, unchanged from 2001
and 2002.

Preliminary data suggest that increases in the number of murders
occurred in the Northeast (+5.1%), South (+2.8%), and West (+1.8%). A
decline in the number of murders was measured in the Midwest (-4.7%). 

-----------------------------------------
Murder and victim characteristics, 2002

In 2002, the year in which the most recent comprehensive data are
available, the FBI reported a total of 16,200 murders or nonnegligent
manslaughters. The total represents a 1% increase from the 16,040
murders recorded in 2001. The FBI defines murder in its annual Crime
in the United States as the willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human
being by another. Not included are deaths caused by negligence, suicide,
or accident; justifiable homicides; and attempts to murder or assaults to
murder, which are scored as aggravated assaults. The FBI's UCR
program gathers statistics on murder from over 17,000 city, county, and
State law enforcement agencies.

Though the rate and level of homicide change year to year, the relationship
between victim characteristics and homicide tends to remain the same. For
example, as in previous years, in 2002 --
                                          
*  Most murder victims were male (77%).
*  When the race of the murder victim was known, about half were white
(49%), and about half were black (49%).  About 3% of murder victims
were of another race.
*  When information on the victim/offender relationship was available,
76% of the offenders were known to the victim, while 24% were a
stranger to the victim.
*  Firearms were used in the majority of murders (71%).
*  Offenders were most often male (90%), and most often adults (92%).
*  Homicide is generally intraracial.
*  Arguments were the most often cited circumstance leading to murder
(28%).
*  Homicides occurred in connection with another felony (such as rape,
robbery, or arson) in 17% of incidents.

Criminal victimization, 2000-01 and 2002-03

Comparing 2-year average annual rates shows that for every major
category of crime except rape/sexual assault, burglary, and motor
vehicle theft the average annual rates were significantly lower in
2002-03 than in 2000-01. The average annual rate of rape/sexual
assault was slightly lower in 2002-03 than in 2000-01, and there was
no difference in the rate of burglary and motor vehicle theft. 

-----------------------------------------
Estimating change in crime victimization rates

Since 1995, the NCVS has undergone sample reductions because of the
escalating costs of data collection. At the same time, the rate of 
violence has continued to decline. The combination of the two -- fewer 
survey respondents and less crime -- has resulted in a diminished 
ability to detect statistically significant year-to-year changes in 
rates.

Comparing 2-year average rates gives the reader a picture of the
continuing decline in rates seen over the last few years. For those 
who rely upon the annual detailed table of victimization counts and 
per capita rates, those data are located on the BJS website at
 <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cv03.htm>.
------------------------------------------

The average annual overall violent victimization rate declined 14% from
27 to 23 victimizations per 1,000 persons per year, 2000-01 to 2002-03.
During the same time robbery rates fell 21%, aggravated assault rates
fell 20%, and simple assault rates fell 11%. 

Property crime rates declined 7% from 172 to 161 crimes per 1,000
households per year, comparing 2000-01 to 2002-03. Over the same
period of comparison, property theft rates declined 8%.

Characteristics of the crime victim, from 2000-01 
to 2002-03

Violent crime

Violent crime rates for both genders dropped 14% from 2000-01 to
2002-03: from 30 to 26 victimizations per 1,000 males and from 23 to
20 victimizations per 1,000 females.

Changed category definitions of race and ethnicity from 2000-01 to
2002-03 prevent comparisons. (See Methodology on page 11 for further
details.)

Rates of violence against persons in every marital category declined at
least somewhat from 2000-01 to 2002-03. 

For persons between ages 12 and 15, violent crime fell significantly
from 58 to 48 victimizations per 1,000 persons. Rates of violent
victimization fell significantly for all persons between ages 25 and 
49. For persons between ages 25 and 49, rates declined 18%.

No clear pattern in short-term changes for income was measured. A
decline in the rate of violent victimization against persons in 
households earning between $7,500 and $14,999 was indicated between 
2000-01 and 2002-03. A slight decline in the rate of violence was 
indicated for those in households earning between $35,000 and $49,999. 
The differences in rates for households earning between $15,000 and
$34,999 and households earning more than $50,000 were not statistically
significant.

Violent crime decreased 16% in the South from 24 to 20 victimizations
per 1,000 persons age 12 or older. Violent victimizations declined 18%
in the West from 33 to 27 victimizations per 1,000 persons. Rates of
violent victimization did not change significantly in the Northeast or
Midwest. Significant declines in the rate of violent victimization were
noted for persons residing in suburban and rural areas while a slight
decline was indicated for urban residents.

Property crime

Between 2000-01 and 2002-03, significant declines in property crime
were observed for households with an annual income of $50,000 or
more. Apparent rate declines for households earning less were not
statistically significant.

A decline of 11% in property crimes was measured in the Northeast
and Midwest, 2000-01 to 2002-03. Rates of property crime for
households in the Northeast declined from 134 to 120 per 1,000
households, and rates of property crime in the Midwest dropped from
177 to 158 per 1,000 households. Apparent declines in the South and
West were not statistically significant.

Rates of property crime declined 10% in rural areas from 142 to 128
per 1,000 households. Households in suburban areas experienced a
decline of 9% from 160 to 145 property victimizations per 1,000
households.

From 2000-01 to 2002-03, average annual property crime rates declined
significantly for resident owners and somewhat for renters.

--------------------------------------
Victimization trends, 1993-2003   

The rate of every major violent and property crime measured in the
NCVS -- rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, simple
assault, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft -- fell 
significantly between 1993-2003.

The overall violent crime rate fell 55% from 50 to 23 violent 
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older between 1993 and 2003. 
Among significant declines measured were those for rates of attempted 
rape (down 71%), rape/sexual assault (down 68%), robbery (down 58%),
aggravated assault (down 62%), and simple assault (down 50%). 

The rate of overall property crime declined significantly from 1993 to
2003, as did the rate for each major type of property crime considered.
The household burglary rate fell 49%; the motor vehicle theft rate fell
53%; and the rate of theft fell 49%. Attempted motor vehicle theft was
marked by one of the largest percentage rate decreases (65%) of all
property crime categories examined, 1993-2003.
----------------------------------------

Characteristics of victims, 1993-2003

Declines in violent victimization were experienced by persons within
gender and household income, 1993-2003. 

While violence decreased for both males and females between 1993 and 
2003, the rate for males declined faster than that for females. The
rate of violence against males declined 56%, from 60 to 26 violent
victimizations per 1,000 males. The rate of violence against females
declined 53%, from 41 to 19 victimizations per 1,000 females.
 
Changes in survey methodology prevent comparisons for race and
ethnicity of victims. See Methodology on page 11 for further details.

Violent crime rates declined at least 40% in every income category
examined, 1993-2003.

Property crime rates fell for every demographic group considered,
1993-2003.  Property crime rates for households that owned their homes
showed a decline of 49%, and rates of households of renters declined
46%.

Households with an annual income greater than $50,000 experienced
larger drops in property crime rates than did households with lower
annual incomes. Households with annual incomes of between $35,000
and $49,999 experienced a larger decrease than households with
incomes of less than $25,000 annually. 

The rate of urban property crime declined 41%, 1993-2003. Property
crime in rural areas decreased 45% during this period. The greatest
decline in property crime rates was 53% from 1993 to 2003 in the
suburbs.


Households in all regions experienced  decreases in property crime rates
of at least 46%, 1993-2003.

Characteristics of violent crime victims, 2003

Persons who have been historically the most vulnerable to violent
victimization -- males and youths -- continued to be victimized at 
higher rates than others in 2003.  

Gender of victim

Males were victims of overall violent crime, robbery, total assault,
simple assault, and aggravated assault at rates higher than those of
females. Females were more likely than males to be victims of
rape/sexual assault. 

Race of victim

Beginning in 2003 survey respondents were able to self-identify with
more than one race. Persons of two or more races were victims of
overall violence at significantly higher rates than those for whites,
blacks, and persons of other races.  

Blacks were victims of overall violence, robbery, aggravated assault, and
personal theft at rates higher than those for whites in 2003. Blacks and
whites were equally likely to experience rape/sexual assault in 2003.

Blacks were also more likely than persons of other races to be victims 
of overall violence, robbery, and simple assault. 

Hispanic origin of victim

Hispanics and non-Hispanics were victims of violence at similar rates
during 2003, with one exception: non-Hispanics were more likely than
Hispanics to be victims of rape and sexual assault.

Age of victim

During 2003 there was a general pattern of decreasing crime rates for
persons of older age categories. Persons age 12 to 19 experienced
overall violence at rates higher than rates for persons age 25 or older.
Persons age 20 to 24 experienced violent victimization at rates somewhat
lower than rates for persons in the age category 16 to 19.

Household income

During 2003 persons in households with an annual income under $7,500
were more likely to be victims of robbery and assault than members of
households with higher incomes. 

Individuals in households earning less than $15,000 annually were victims 
of aggravated assault at a significantly higher rate than those of
persons in households at higher income levels. Members in households
earning $15,000 to $24,999 and $25,000 to $34,999 experienced rape/sexual
assault, aggravated and simple assault, and personal theft at similar 
rates. Persons residing in households earning more than $75,000 were 
victims of violent crime at a significantly lower rate than those of 
persons in households earning less.

Marital status


Persons who were never married experienced overall violent victimization
at rates higher than those for married, widowed, or divorced/ separated
persons.

Region

Western residents experienced assault at significantly higher rates than
the rates of residents in the Northeast and South in 2003. Northeastern,
Southern, and Midwestern residents were victims of violent crime overall
at similar rates, 2003. There were no regional differences in rates of
robbery.

Residence

Urban residents were victimized at rates higher than rates for suburban
and rural residents during 2003. Suburban and rural residents were
victims of violence at statistically similar rates during 2003.

Characteristics of victims of property crime, 2003

Annual household income

With one exception, overall property crime rates did not differ by annual
household income. Households earning less than $7,500 experienced
total property victimizations at a rate higher than those of households 
with higher annual incomes. The relationship between annual household
income and crime rates did vary for  specific types of property crime.

Households with an annual income below $35,000 were burglarized at
rates higher than those of households with larger incomes. Households
earning $7,500 to $14,999 experienced theft at rates significantly lower
than rates of households earning $35,000 or more annually. Households
earning $25,000 to $34,999 were more likely to experience motor vehicle
theft than households earning $50,000 to $74,999.

Region, locality, and home ownership

Western households were victims of overall property crime at the highest
rate; Northeastern households, at the lowest, in 2003. Southern and
Midwestern households were victims of property crimes at similar rates.

Northeastern households were less likely to be burglarized than
households in other regions. The Midwest, South, West had similar 2003
rates of burglary. Western households were victims of motor vehicle 
theft at rates higher than those in other regions.

Western households experienced theft at the highest regional rate;
Northeastern households, at the lowest. Theft rates for Southern and
Midwestern households were similar during 2003.
 
Urban households were victims of each type of property crime at rates
higher than those for suburban and rural households, 2003. Except for
burglary, suburban households were victims of each type of property
crime at rates higher than rural household rates.

Rural households were burglarized at a rate higher than that for suburban
households but lower than the urban burglary rate.

In 2003 households that rented were more likely than households that
owned their home to experience all types of property crime.


Characteristics of the crime incident

Victim-offender relationship in violent crimes

Females were most often victimized by someone they knew while males
were more likely to be victimized by a stranger during 2003.

Of those offenders victimizing females, 38% were described as friends/
acquaintances, 19% as intimates, and 10% as some other relative. 
Strangers to the victim committed 32% of the violence against females. 
In contrast, of those offenders victimizing males, 35% were described 
as friends/ acquaintances, 3% as intimates, and 5% as other relatives.
Strangers committed 54% of the violence against males. 

Robbery was the crime most likely to be committed by a stranger for both
male and female victims.

Presence of weapons in violent crimes

During 2003, 24% of all violent crime incidents were committed by an
armed offender. The presence of a weapon during a violent crime was
related to the type of crime. For example, rape and sexual assault
incidents were the least likely (11%)and robberies the most likely 
(45%) to occur with an armed offender.

The type of weapon also varied by the type of violence. Three percent of
rape/sexual assault incidents occurred with a firearm present, compared
to 25% of robbery incidents. The rate of firearm violence declined
significantly between 1993 and 2003, from 5.9 to 1.9 victimizations per
1,000.

Reporting to the police

During 2003, 48% of all violent victimizations and 38% of all property
crimes were reported to the police. The percentage of violent crime
reported differed among the specific types of crime. Robbery (61%) and
aggravated assault (59%) were most frequently reported to police.
Thirty-nine percent of victims of rape/sexual assault and 42% of the
victims of simple assault indicated that their victimization had been
reported to the police. Motor vehicle theft continued to be the property
crime most frequently reported to the police (77%).

Fifty-four percent of burglaries and 32% of thefts were reported to the
police in 2003.

Reporting and victim characteristics

In 2003 males and females were equally likely to report violent and
property victimizations to the police. Apparent differences in the 
rate of reporting between these two groups were not significant. 

Differences between males and females in the reporting of violent crime
were observed across racial and ethnic categories. Black and Hispanic
females were more likely to report a violent victimization to the police
than black or Hispanic males. Among male victims the percentage of
violence reported to the police did not differ across racial and ethnic
categories, 2003.

With one exception among female victims, percentages of crimes reported 
to the police did not differ across racial categories. Violent crimes 
against black women were more likely to be reported to the police than 
crimes against white women. Hispanic and non-Hispanic women were equally
likely to report violent victimizations to the police in 2003.

Reporting crime to the police, 1993-2003

Overall reporting of violent and property crime increased significantly
from 1993 to 2003. 

Increases in reporting varied by type of crime. For both robbery and rape/
sexual assault there was a decrease in the percentage of crime reported
to police between 2002 to 2003, interrupting a generally upward trend and
returning to levels of reporting similar to those of 1993. Reporting of
aggravated and simple assault remained statistically similar to reporting
levels in 2002. 

Reporting to police of burglary (from 50% in 1993 to 54% in 2003)
increased somewhat. Increases in the reporting of theft were statistically
significant from 1993 to 2003. (For further discussion see Reporting
Crime to the Police, 1992-2000, <www.ojp.Usdoj.gov/bjs/
abstract/rcp00htm.>)               

Survey methodology

This Bulletin presents data on nonlethal violence and property crimes
from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), and data on
homicide from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program. In 2003,
83,660 households and 149,040 people age 12 or older were interviewed.
For the 2003 NCVS data presented here, the  response rate was 91.6%
of eligible households and 86.3% of eligible individuals. 

In 1997 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) introduced new
guidelines for the collection and reporting of race and ethnicity data 
in government surveys. These methodological changes were implemented
for all demographic surveys as of January 1, 2003. Individuals are now
allowed to choose more than one racial category. In prior years they 
were asked to select a single primary race. 

----------------------------------------------
Impact of 2000 Census population controls

Estimates for 2003 incorporate population controls based on the 2000
decennial Census. The new controls increased the estimated level of
the U.S. population age 12 or older. These increases may have impacted 
the estimates for numbers of crimes of violence and theft but have only
minimal effect on the rate estimates presented in this report. When 
estimates for 2002 were recalibrated using 2000 Census population 
controls, neither the counts nor the rates of violent or property 
crimes changed significantly: 

The Census Bureau did not revise the published estimates of population
or crimes for 2000, 2001, and 2002, based on the 2000 decennial Census. 
Such  revisions would have had only small impact on the estimates of 
crime for victim subgroups or for characterizing crime incidents.
---------------------------------------------

Racial categories presented in this report now consist of the following:
white only, black only, other race only (American Indian, Alaska Native,
Asian, Pacific Islander if only one of these races is given), and two or
more races (all persons of any race indicating two or more races). About
0.9% of persons in the NCVS sample and  about 2.6% of victims of crimes 
of violence identified two or more races. Individuals are now asked 
whether they are of Hispanic ethnicity before being asked about
their race, and are now asked directly if they are Spanish, Hispanic, 
or Latino.

Standard error computations

Comparisons of percentages and rates made in this report were tested
to determine if observed differences were statistically significant.
Differences described as higher, lower, or different passed a hypothesis
test at the .05 level of statistical significance (95% confidence level). 
The tested difference was greater than twice the standard error of that
difference. For comparisons that were statistically significant at the 
0.10 level(90% confidence level), "somewhat," "slightly," "marginally," 
or " there is some indication that" is used to note the nature of the
difference. 
 
Caution is required when comparing estimates not explicitly discussed in
this Special Report. What may appear to be large differences may not
test as statistically significant at the 95% or the 90% confidence level.
Significance testing calculations were conducted at the Bureau of Justice
Statistics using statistical programs developed specifically for the NCVS
by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. These programs take into consideration 
many aspects of the complex NCVS sample design when calculating generalized
variance estimates.
