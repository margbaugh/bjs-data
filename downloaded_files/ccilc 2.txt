Plaintiffs trying to recover payment for goods or services made up
half the contract cases in the Nation's 75 largest counties, 1992
----------------------------------------------

*State courts of general jurisdiction in the Nation's 75 most
populous counties disposed of approximately 366,000 contract cases
in 1992. 

*Cases involving contract disputes comprised about half of all the
tort, contract, and real property cases disposed in these
jurisdictions. 
 
*The most frequent type of contract dispute involved the plaintiff
as a seller seeking compensation from a buyer or borrower.

*In contract cases, businesses made up about two-thirds of the
plaintiffs, and individuals about a quarter.

*Defendants in contract cases were most frequently businesses,
followed by individuals

.*Almost two-thirds of the contract cases were disposed within 1
year of filing the complaint.

*About half the contract cases were resolved through an agreed
judgment by the litigating parties.  Less than 3% were concluded by
a jury or bench trial.  In an additional quarter of the cases, the
court issued a default judgment because the defendant(s) failed to
respond to the complaint or make a court appearance.

Contract Cases in Large Counties

During a 1-year period ending in June 1992, State courts of general
jurisdiction in the Nation's 75 largest counties disposed of an
estimated 366,000 civil contract disputes involving 1.3 million
plaintiffs and defendants.  Contract cases include allegations of
unfulfilled written or oral agreements made between such parties as
buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, or landlords and
tenants.

A representative sample of 11,000 contract cases was drawn from
files of general jurisdiction courts in 45 of the Nation's 75
largest counties. The sample excluded contract cases disposed of in
Federal courts and in State courts outside the 75 largest counties. 
Also excluded were contract cases disposed of in States' limited
jurisdiction courts.     

Between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, State courts of general
jurisdiction in the Nation's 75 largest counties disposed of an
estimated 764,000 tort, contract, and real property rights cases.
Contract cases accounted for approximately half (48%) of all the
disposed cases.

--------------------------
Types of contract cases 
--------------------------

About half (51.7%) of the contract cases in this study were
complaints filed by a seller charging a defendant with failure to
comply with an agreement). The next most frequent kinds of contract
cases involved mortgage foreclosures (18.8%) and cases in which the
buyer of goods or services was the plaintiff seeking return of
money, rescission of the contract, or delivery of the goods ordered
(12.2%). Additional types of cases included rental or lease
agreements (5.6%) and employment-related cases (2.2%).

in the Nation's 75 largest counties.

----------------------------------
Type of litigants:  Plaintiffs
----------------------------------
In 68% of the contract cases, the plaintiff was a
business.(Plaintiff type for each case is whichever type appears
first in this list:  (1) hospital/medical company, (2) business,
(3) government agency, and (4) individual.  For example, any case
involving a hospital plaintiff is categorized as a case with a
"hospital plaintiff" even if there were also business, individual,
or government plaintiffs in the case). Individuals were plaintiffs
in 26% of the cases; the remainder were hospitals and government
agencies. Businesses made up a majority of plaintiffs in seller,
mortgage foreclosure, and rental/lease agreement cases. By
contrast, indi-viduals were the most common type of plaintiff in
employment and fraud cases and in those cases in which a buyer was
seeking a remedy.

----------------------------------
Type of litigants:  Defendants
----------------------------------

In most categories of contract cases, businesses predominated as
defendants.(Defendant type for each case is whichever type appears
first in this list: (1) hospital/medical company, (2) business,(3)
government agency, and (4) individual). Businesses made up
three-quarters or more of the defendants in buyer plaintiff and
employment cases. In fraud, rental or lease  agreements, and other
contract cases, businesses made up at least half of the defendants. 
A government agency was the defendant in 13% of the employment
cases. 

----------------
Who sues whom?
----------------

Relatively few contract cases (8%) involved an individual suing
another individual.  Contract cases most frequently (37%) involved
a business or other organization such as a hospital or government
agency suing a business.  An additional 31% of all the contract
cases involved a nondividual (business, hospital, or government
agency) suing an individual.  

Over 40% of seller plaintiff, mortgage foreclosure, and
rental/lease cases involved a business, a government agency, or a
hospital suing a business. By contrast, in 58% of the buyer
plaintiff cases, an individual sued a business. 

------------------------------------------
Contract cases in Federal district courts
------------------------------------------
Contract cases in Federal district court consist of those involving
private parties and those in which the U.S. Government is a party
to the suit as either plaintiff or defendant.  In fiscal year 1992
(October 1991-September 30, 1992) a total of 49,434 contract cases
were commenced in U.S. district courts. This dropped to 31,254 in
fiscal year 1994.   

In fiscal year 1992 litigants filed 28,467 private civil cases
without the U.S. Government as a party to the complaint. In fiscal
year 1994 the number was 26,439 cases.

Contract cases in which the Federal Government was either a
plaintiff or defendant have ranged from over 65,600 in fiscal year
1985 to 4,800 in fiscal year 1994. The fluctuation in the number of
Federal Government contract cases is primarily the result of
changes in the number of cases involving student loan defaults and
recovery of overpayments to veterans. Student loan filings
decreased in 1993 and were expected to decline further as the
collection of delinquent student loans through wage garnishment was
authorized in 1991. Likewise, the Department of Veterans Affairs
has instituted administrative remedies to settle overpayment of
veteran benefits to reduce claims filed 
in U.S. district courts.

------------------------------------
Multiple plaintiffs and defendants 
------------------------------------

The estimated 366,000 contract cases disposed in the State general
jurisdiction courts of the 75 largest counties involved a total of
approximately 1.3 million litigants. The median number of litigants
per case was 3.0; the 
average was 3.6. Cases with multiple defendants were more prevalent
than multiple plaintiffs.  The average number of defendants in
contract cases was 2.4. The average number of plaintiffs for all
contract cases was 1.2 per case. On average, mortgage foreclosure
cases had 3.9 defendants per case, followed by fraud cases with 3.1
defendants per case.

-----------------------------------------------
Insurance companies and contract cases Insurance companies as
plaintiff
----------------------------------------------

An insurance company was the plaintiff in 13,290 contract cases. 
In about 12,000, or 90% of these cases, an insurance company was
the only plaintiff.  In the remainder an insurance company was one
of at least two plaintiffs.(In cases with insurance companies as
one of multiple plaintiffs or defendants, a variety of plaintiff
and defendant combinations occurred.  Consequently, it is not
possible to determine the specific role of the insurance company
relative to the other plaintiffs or defendants in these cases. 
Therefore, where possible, data are presented for those cases in
which an insurance company is the sole plaintiff or defendant).

--------------------------------------------
What types of contract cases were insurance company plaintiffs
involved in?
--------------------------------------------

Three-fourths of the 12,000 contract cases in which an insurance
company was the single plaintiff involved contract seller cases. 
Generally, these were cases in which the insurance company was
seeking payment for damages.

---------------------------------------------
How were contract cases brought by insurance company  plaintiffs
disposed?
---------------------------------------------
 
Among the contract suits brought by an insurance company acting
alone--
  46% were disposed by agreed judgment
  28% by default judgment
  10% by dismissal
   9% by summary judgment7% by other means such       as
arbitration, jury or bench trial, or        transfer to another
court.

--------------------------------
Insurance companies as defendant
--------------------------------

An insurance company was named as a defendant in about 25,400
contract cases.  In about half of these lawsuits, the insurance
company was the sole defendant.  Another 16%  involved an insurance
company and a business as co-defendants, and 12% involved an
insurance company and a bank.
------------------------------
Who sues insurance companies?
------------------------------
In the 13,000 contract cases in which an insurance company was
named as the sole defendant, 84% were initiated by an individual,
7% by a business, 4% by another insurance company, 3% by multiple
plaintiffs, and 2% by a bank, other organization, or hospital.
----------------------------------------------
What types of suits were insurance company defendants involved in?
----------------------------------------------
As defendants, insurance companies were primarily involved in buyer
plaintiff cases.  Generally, these were cases in which an insurance
company was sued for refusal to pay a claim.  Insurance companies
were also defendants in seller plaintiff cases which may have
involved matters such as real estate or finance.  Overall,
insurance companies named as the only defendant were involved in
the following types of cases:

----------------------------------------------
In contract cases with an insurance company as the only defendant,
72% were resolved by agreed judgment, 9% by transfer to another
court, 6% by summary judgment, 6% by dismissal, and 7% by other
means such as arbitration,jury or bench trial, or default judgment.

Jury cases
-----------

----------------------------------------------
How did insurance companies fare as plaintiffs in jury trial cases?
----------------------------------------------
An insurance company was the sole plaintiff in an estimated 61
contract cases resolved by jury trial in the Nation's 75 largest
counties during the year ending June 30, 1992.  As the only
plaintiff, insurance companies won 74% of the jury trial verdicts
in contract cases.  Juries awarded altogether $9 million in
compensatory and punitive damages.  The average final amount
awarded was $192,000, and the median recovery was $22,000.
----------------------------------------------
How did insurance companies fare as defendants in jury trial cases?
----------------------------------------------
In an estimated 155 contract cases disposed by jury trial in the
top 75 counties, an insurance company was named as the sole
defendant.  In 59% of these cases, the jury found the insurance
company liable for damages and awarded a total of $45 million in
compensatory and punitive damages to the plaintiff winners.  The
average final amount awarded was $492,000, and the median recovery
was $26,000. Punitive damages Punitive damages are reserved for
claims in which the defendant's conduct was grossly negligent or
intentional.  Under the laws in almost all States, only tort claims
qualify for punitive damages.  If a contract case involved punitive
damages, it involved a related tort claim.  In 5 of the 155
contract cases disposed by jury trial in which an insurance company
was the sole defendant, plaintiffs were awarded punitive damages. 


The total amount of punitive damages awarded in these 5 cases was
$15 million.  The average punitive damage award was $3 million, and
the median award was $200,000.

---------------------------------------------
Banks and financial companies and contract cases
---------------------------------------------

--------------------
Banks as plaintiff
--------------------

In approximately 97,000 contract cases, a bank or financial company
was a plaintiff.  In 91% of these cases, the bank or financial
company was the sole plaintiff.(In cases with a bank or a financial
company as one of multiple 
plaintiffs or defendants, a variety of plaintiff and defendant
combinations occurred.  Consequently, it is not possible to
determine the specific role of the bank or the financial company
relative to other plaintiffs or defendants in these cases. 
Therefore, where possible, data are presented for those cases in
which a bank or financial company was the sole plaintiff or
defendant).

Who do banks and financial companies sue in contract cases?
---------------------------------------------
A bank or financial company as a single plaintiff sued:

---------------------------------------------
How were cases filed against a bank or financial company disposed?
---------------------------------------------
Fifty-eight percent of the 36,000 cases with a bank or financial
company named as at least one of the defendants were disposed of by
agreed judgment, 20% by default judgment, 9% by dismissal, 8% by
summary judgment, and 6% by other means such as jury or bench
trial, arbitration, or transfer to another court.

-----------
Jury cases
-----------

---------------------------------------------
How did banks or financial companies fare as plaintiffs in jury
trial cases?
---------------------------------------------
In an estimated 54 contract cases disposed by jury trial in the
Nation's 75 largest counties, a bank was the only type of plaintiff
who brought the suit.  In two-thirds of these cases, the bank won
the jury trial verdict.  Juries awarded a total of $12 million in
compensatory and punitive damages to bank plaintiff winners.  The
average amount awarded was $333,000, and the median amount was
$63,000.
--------------------------------------------
How did banks or financial companies fare as defendants in jury
trial cases?
--------------------------------------------
A bank was the only defendant in an estimated 26 contract cases
concluded by jury trial. In 48% of these cases, the jury found in
favor of the plaintiff.  Juries awarded $1.6 million in damages to
these plaintiff winners. The average award was $130,000, and the
median recovery was $145,000.

---------------
Trial verdicts
----------------

About 3% of the contract cases were resolved by trial (jury or
bench) in the Nation's 75 most populous counties during the 1-year
period. Of the 9,500 cases that did go to trial, about a quarter
were disposed of by a jury verdict.

--------------------
Bench trial verdicts
---------------------

About 2% of contract cases were disposed by bench trial (trial by
a judge rather than a jury). In the contract cases that did receive
a bench verdict, the plaintiff was the winner in 73% of the cases).
Among types of contract cases with sufficient data to permit
estimation, plaintiffs won in 90% of rental/lease cases, 85% of
seller plaintiff cases, and 66% of buyer plaintiff cases.


--------------------
Jury trial verdicts
--------------------

Of the contract cases disposed by a jury trial in State general
jurisdiction courts in the Nation's 75 largest counties during the
1-year period ending June 30, 1992, the plaintiff won 63% of the
cases.  The median final amount (compensatory and punitive damages
reduced for contributory negligence, if applicable) awarded to
these plaintiff winners was $56,000, and the mean amount awarded
was $620,000. The likelihood of plaintiff success varied by type of
contract case, as did the final amounts awarded. 

-------------------------------------
Types of contract case dispositions
-------------------------------------

The majority of contract cases were resolved either through an
agreed judgment (49%) or by default judgment (26%).  Courts
dismissed 12% of the cases.  Less than 3% of the cases were
disposed by a trial (bench or jury). 

Approximately a third of seller plaintiff and mortgage foreclosure
cases received a default judgment because the defendant failed to
respond to the complaint or appear at a scheduled hearing.  

---------------------- 
Legal representation 
----------------------

In the vast majority of contract cases, plaintiffs and defendants
had professional legal representation.  About 6% of contract cases
had at least one pro se litigant who represented himself or
herself.  Rental or lease agreement cases had a pro se litigant in
about 8% of cases.

----------------------------   
Uncontested contract cases
-----------------------------

In half (51%) of all the contract cases, the defendant failed to
file an answer to the complaint.  Failure to answer in a timely
manner (usually within 30 to 45 days) gives the plaintiff the right
to file a motion for default judgment.  About 45% of the
uncontested cases were disposed of by default judgment, 37% by
agreed judgment, 16% by dismissal, and 2% by transfer to another
State or Federal court.  The median case processing time for
uncontested cases was 5 months.

----------------------
Case processing time
----------------------

The average processing time from filing of the complaint to
disposition for contract cases was 13 months.  The median time was
8.3 months.  Among the different kinds of contract cases,
employment and fraud cases had a mean case processing time of about
20 months, and mortgage foreclosure cases had a mean time of 10
months from filing to disposition. 

Contract cases disposed by jury trial had a mean processing time of
over 2.5 years.  Agreed judgment cases took on average just over 1
year to dispose.  Cases disposed of by default judgment took
approximately 7 months from the filing of the complaint to the
disposition.

-------------------
County-level data
--------------------

The volume and composition of contract cases disposed, their
average case processing time, and the types  of litigants involved
differed across the individual State courts sampled in this study. 
A variety of factors may contribute to these differences, including
State contract law, court operations, and the type and level of
commercial activity in the jurisdiction.

The 1992 data revealed that:

*In DuPage County, Illinois, primarily a residential county, 88% of
the contract cases involved mortgage foreclosures.

*(In Fresno County, California, the effect of a backlog relief
program was reflected in longer overall case processing times as
the court disposed of numerous older cases during the study period.

*In Cuyahoga County, Ohio, 48% of contract cases involved mortgage
foreclosure, a sizable proportion of which were property tax
delinquency cases in which the county was the plaintiff.

*In Wayne County, Michigan, 55% of the contract cases were buyer
plaintiff.  A substantial part of these cases were individuals
suing an insurance company, possibly related to no-fault insurance
claims.

Methodology
------------

Sample
------

The sample is a 2-stage stratified sample with 45 of the 75 most
populous counties selected at the first stage.  The 75 counties
were divided into 4 strata based on civil disposition data for 1990
obtained through telephone interviews with court staff in the
general jurisdiction trial courts.  Stratum 1 consisted of the 14
counties with the largest number of civil case dispositions.  Every
county in stratum 1 was selected for the sample.  Stratum 2
consisted of 15 counties, with 12 chosen for the sample.  From
stratum 3, 10 of the 20 counties were selected.  Nine of the
twenty-six counties in stratum 4 were included in the sample.  

At the second stage, either a systematic or random sample of
400-450 tort, contract, and real property rights cases disposed
between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, was selected within the
State general jurisdiction trial court of each county.  Data on
11,000 contract cases were collected in the 45 courts. 

Sampling error
---------------

Since the data in this report came from a sample, a sampling error
(standard error) is associated with each reported number.  In
general, if the difference between two numbers is greater than
twice the standard error for that difference, there is 95 percent
confidence 
of a real difference and that the apparent difference is not simply
the result of using a sample rather than the entire population. 
All the differences discussed in this report were statistically
significant at or above the 95 percent confidence level.  

The 75 counties' estimate of 366,000 contract cases had a
coefficient of variation of 7%.  Standard error estimation took
into account the survey's sample design features.

--------------------------------------------
Data recording and unobtainable information
--------------------------------------------

For each sampled case, a standard coding form was manually
completed by court staff on-site to record information about the
litigants, case type, disposition type, and processing time.  
Information for which data were not available included the cost of
litigation for the parties involved, as well as for others, and the
results of settlement.

-------------------------------
Contract case type definitions
-------------------------------

Contracts--Cases which include all allegations of breach of
contract. Specific case types include seller plaintiff  (seller of
goods or services, including lenders, seek payment of money owed to
them by a buyer, including borrowers); buyer plaintiff (purchasers
of goods or services seek return of their money, rescission of the
contract, or delivery of the specified goods ordered); mortgage
contract/foreclosure (foreclosures on real property, commercial, or
residential--because the title to real property is transferred to
the lender if the claim is successful, it could be included under
real property cases--and property tax delinquency cases); fraud
(financial damages incurred because of intentional or negligent
misrepresentation regarding a product or company; also considered
a type of tort claim, but because it arises out of commercial
transactions, it was included under contracts); employment claim
(claim involving employment or hiring process, including claims of
employment discrimination; worker's compensation claims, handled
primarily through an administrative process, were not included);
rental/lease agreement; and other contract claims (including
partnership claims, stockholder claims, and subrogation issues).

Default judgment--Occurs when a litigant has failed to file an
answer to a complaint or failed to appear at a scheduled hearing.

Dismissal for lack of service or prosecution-- Failure to obtain
legal service of the complaint can lead to a dismissal after a
stated period; most courts can also dismiss a case for the
plaintiff's failure to prosecute after a case has been inactive for
18 to 24 months.

Summary judgment--Entered by a judge after considering evidence
submitted by both parties and determining that no controversy
exists about the facts in the case; the only issue is application
of the law to the facts. 

Other dispositions--Includes cases settled after a jury or bench
trial started, settled after a jury or bench trial verdict was
entered, or concluded with a directed verdict (a verdict that the
jury returned at the direction of the court or that the court
entered on the record after dismissal of the jury because the court
found the evidence to be insufficient to support the jury's
decision).

Arbitration award--Typically entered without appeal in
jurisdictions with arbitration programs associated with the court. 

Agreed judgment/voluntary dismissal--Primarily cases settled and
dismissed and some cases voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs
without a settlement. Types of dismissals were not identified by
many courts.  This category could also include dismissals for lack
of jurisdiction. 

Trial verdict--Rendered by jury or bench (judge) trial.

During a 1-year period ending in 1992, State courts of general
jurisdiction in the Nation's 75 largest counties disposed of an
estimated 378,000 tort cases involving altogether 1.4 million
plaintiffs and defendants.  Individuals suing businesses accounted
for a third of all cases.  The average time courts took to dispose
of a tort case was just over 1«   years.  Trial verdicts accounted
for 3% of all tort cases disposed.  In terms of scope, the study is
the closest that exists to a national study of tort cases.  These
survey data establish a bench mark against which furture tort
reforms can be evaluated.  Moreover, survey results provide a
baseline to which individual courts can compare themselves.  The
sample  The 378,000 tort cases were disposed from July 1, 1991 to
June 30, 1992 in State general jurisdiction courts  in the Nation's
75 largest counties.  A representative sample of 18,000 cases was
drawn from court files in 45 of the 75 counties. (See appendix
table 1.) Tort case in the largest 75 counties represent about half
of the cases dis- posed nationwide (See Methodolgy).  The sample
excluded Federal courts, which account for about 4% of all tort
cases and State courts outside the 75 largest counties.1 Also
excluded were tort cases disposed in States' limited jurisdiction 
courts.2    Type of tort cases  Plaintiffs sue in tort cases
alleging injury, loss, or damage from the negligent or intentional
acts of the defendants.  Types of  cases vary.  Over the 1-year
period, the two most frequent kinds of general tort cases  disposed
were automobile accident (60%) and premises liability, an alleged
harm that results from inadequately maintained or dangerous
property (17%) (table 1).   Other types of cases included those
that had been a primary focus of tort reform such as product
liability (3%) and medical malpractice (5%).     In 92% of tort
cases, the plaintiff cited personal injury as the type of harm
involved.  Property damage was cited in 5% and financial loss or
injury to reputation in 3% of tort cases. The majority of  tort
cases involving personal  injury (64%) and property damage (60%)
were auto torts.     Type of  tort case disposition  The most
common method of tort case disposition was an agreed settlement or
voluntary dismissal (73%) (table 2).  Approximately 10% of the
cases were dismissed for a lack of prosecution or failure to serve
a complaint on the defendant.    A jury (2%) or bench (1%) trial
verdict disposed of relatively few cases. Medical malpractice
claims were the most likely to be disposed by a bench or jury trial
(7%).  Relatively few tort cases had litigants without
representation of an attorney (pro se).  Three percent of the cases
involved at least one pro se litigant.   Uncontested  tort cases  
In 28% of tort cases the defendant failed to file an answer to the
com- plaint.  Failure to  answer in a timely manner (usually within
30 to 45 days) gives the plaintiff the right  to file  a motion for
a default judgment.  Such uncontested tort cases comprised 81% of
all cases disposed by default judgments.   Case processing time   
The mean tort case processing time from the filing of the case to
disposition was 19.3 months and the median was 13.7 months (table
3).  Within 1 year  44% of all tort cases were disposed, and by 2
years, 74% were disposed.  Case processing was fastest for auto
torts (median of 1 year).  One reason for the relatively fast
processing time was that auto tort cases were among the types with
the fewest number of litigants (median of 3).  Also, compared  to
all other types, auto torts had the largest percentage with an
individual (rather than institutions) as the defendant.    Case
processing time was slowest for toxic substance cases (median time
of nearly 2«   years).  Contributing to this  relatively slow time
was the number of litigants per case:  toxic substance cases had
the most litigants of any type of case _ an average of 14 per case,
compared to 3 for all tort cases (table 3).  Toxic tort cases also
involve complex issues regarding causation of harm.  On average,
tort cases disposed by a jury or bench trial verdict had the long-
est case processing time, exceeding 20 months.  The longest
processing time for a sampled case was 14 years and 5 months.  This
case of negligence involved 3 individuals who named 14 defendants 
in the complaint, including individuals, businesses, and a
government agen-cy.  It was disposed by an agreed settlement. 
Types of litigants: plaintiffs  Each case, regardless of number or
types of plaintiffs, was given one plaintiff designation: 
hospital, business, government, or individual.3  Similarly, each
was also given a single defendant designation.  A case with
multiple types of  plaintiffs or defendants was assigned the
designation of whichever type appears first in the above listing. 
  Because tort litigation primarily involves claims or damages
related to personal injury, the vast majority (94%) of cases had an
individual as the primary plaintiff.  Businesses were plaintiffs in
6% of all tort cases, and hospitals and government agencies each
were less than 1% (table 5).    Businesses were the primary
plaintiff in 20% of nonmedical professional malpractice cases, 15%
of slander, and 12% of product liability.    Types of litigants:
defendants   The composition of defendants in tort cases differed
from that of the plaintiffs.  While in more than 9 in 10 tort cases
the primary plaintiff was an individual, half the cases had an
individual as the primary defendant.  Approximately 40% of the tort
cases had a business as the primary defendant.      A majority
(70%) of auto cases named an individual as the defendant.  In
three-quarters or more of premises liability cases (75%), product
liability (93%), and toxic substance (96%) cases, a business was
the defendant.  Among medical malpractice cases, hospitals
comprised 72% of the defendants.     Who sues whom?  The most
common type of tort case involved individual(s) suing individual(s)
(47% of all torts) (table 6).  Next  most common type was
individual(s) suing business(es) (37%).  The cases in which
individual(s) sued a government agency or hospital were 5%.   Auto
torts were primarily individual versus individual; medical
malpractice cases individual versus hospital; and toxic substance 
and product liability cases, individual versus business.  County
specific data  The volume and composition of tort cases disposed,
their average case processing time, and the types of litigants
varied across the individual state courts sampled in this project. 
(see Appendix tables 1-3).  Numerous factors can contribute to
these differ- ences.   These include the types of commercial
enterprises located in the jurisdiction and the demographic
characteristics of the residents.  The presence of no-fault auto
insurance, and laws addressing the plaintiff's role in contributory
negligence can also impact tort case load.  States vary in the
minimum amount of money that must be involved for a civil case to
be filed  in the general jurisdiction court.  The minimum threshold
can range from $25,000 in California to $2,000 in Connecticut.   
Methodology  Sample  The Civil Trial Court Network Project sample
is a 2-stage stratified sample with 45 of the 75 most populous
counties selected at the first stage.  The 75 counties were divided
into 4 strata based on civil disposition data for 1990 obtained
through telephone interviews with court staffs in the general
jurisdiction trial courts.  For stratum 1 _14 counties with the
largest number of civil case dispositions _ every county was
selected.  Stratum 2 consisted  of 15 counties with 12 chosen. 
From stratum 3, 10 of the 20 counties were selected.  Nine of the
twenty-six counties in stratum four were included.    At the second
stage, either an interval or random sample of 400-450 tort cases
disposed between July 1, 1991, and June 30, 1992, was selected
within the State general jurisdiction trial court of each county. 
Data on 18,178 general civil cases were collected.    The estimate
that the Nation's 75 largest comprised a half of the Nation's tort
case load is based on statewide tort filings available for 16
States.   Tort case type definitions:  Torts _ Claims arising from
personal injury or property damage caused by negligent or
intentional act of another person or business.  Specific tort case
types include: automobile accident;  premises liability (injury
caused by the dangerous condition of residential or commercial
property); medical malpractice (by doctor, dentist, or medical
professional); other professional malpractice (as by engineers or
architects); product liability (injury or damage caused by 
defective products); toxic substance (injury caused by toxic
substances, primarily asbestos in this study); libel/slander
(injury to reputation); intentional tort (such as vandalism and
intentional personal injury); and other negligent acts.   Tort case
disposition definitions:  Default judgment _ Occurs upon motion of
the opposing party when a litigant has failed to file an answer to
a complaint or failed to appear at a scheduled hearing. Dismissal
for lack of service or prosecution _  Failure to obtain legal
service of the complaint can lead to a dismissal after a stated
period; most courts can also dismiss a case for the plaintiff's
failure to prosecute after a case has been inactive for 18 to 24
months.  Summary judgment _ Entered by a judge after considering
evidence submitted by both parties and determining that no
controversy exists about the facts in the case; the only issue is
application of the law to the facts.   Other dispositions _
Includes cases settled after a jury or bench trial started, 
settled after a jury or bench trial verdict was entered, or
concluded with a directed verdict (a verdict that the jury returned
at the direction of the court or that the court entered on the
record after dismissal of the jury because the court found the
evidence to be insufficient  to support the jury's decision). 
Arbitration award _ Typically entered without appeal in
jurisdictions with arbitration programs associated with the court. 
Agreed settlement/voluntary dimissal  _  Primarily cases settled
and  dismissed and some cases voluntarily dismissed by plaintiffs
without a settlement.  Types of dismissals were not identified by
many courts; it could also include dismissals for lack of
jurisdiction.   Trial verdict _ Rendered by jury or bench (judge)
trial.
