Highlights
                
Nearly all State inmates held in facilities that test for 
hepatitis C

*  At midyear 2000, 1,113,035 inmates (94% of all inmates) 
were held in facilities that reported having a testing 
policy for hepatitis C.

*  Forty-nine States and the District of Columbia reported 
having at least one facility that tested inmates for 
hepatitis C. Ten States reported that all of their 
facilities tested inmates.

Nearly a third of hepatitis C tests confirmed
positive

*  33% of tests in facilities that tested only targeted groups 
were positive compared to 27% of those in facilities that 
conducted broad tests (random basis or all inmates).

*  Of the 1,033 facilities that provide hepatitis B vaccinations, 
680 (66%) had a policy to vaccinate inmates in high-risk groups. 
Thirty-six States and the District of Columbia completed at least 
one 3-dose series hepatitis B vaccination.

Overview of hepatitis B and hepatitis C              
Hepatitis B and hepatitis C are viral diseases that attack the 
liver. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) can cause lifelong infection, cirrhosis (scarring) of the 
liver, cancer, liver failure, and death. Both viruses are spread 
through infected blood, most commonly in shared needles to inject 
illegal drugs, and through sexual contact.

Hepatitis B typically causes a limited infection that the body 
can fight off within a few months. Persons who resist the 
infection develop an immunity to the virus; those who do not 
become carriers of the virus. About 5-10% of those infected with 
HBV develop chronic hepatitis B.  Hepatitis B can be treated with 
immunization if diagnosed within 2 weeks of exposure.

About 80% of persons infected with HCV develop a chronic infection. 
However, the majority of those with chronic infection will not have 
severe liver damage.  Chronic HCV can be treated with antiviral 
medications, with success rates of 30-40%. These medications may
cause harsh side effects.

In the 2000 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities, 
1,209 of the 1,584 State public and private adult correctional 
facilities reported that they tested inmates for hepatitis C between 
July 1,1999, and June 30, 2000. These facilities housed about 94% of 
all State inmates for whom prison census data were reported on June 
30, 2000. Of the 57,018 hepatitis C tests made in the 12 months
before the census, 17,911 (31%) were positive.
                
Nearly 70% of all State adult correctional facilities (1,104) reported 
that they had a policy to treat inmates for hepatitis C. A total of 
6,046 inmates were treated between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000.
                
At midyear 2000, 1,033 facilities also reported that, as a matter of 
policy, they provide hepatitis B vaccinations. During the 12-month 
period, 401 facilities actually administered the vaccination. In
those facilities 13,655 inmates completed the 3-dose series 
vaccination for hepatitis B.
                
The census was an enumeration of all 84 Federal, 1,320 State, and 264 
private facilities in operation on June 30, 2000. The census, for the 
first time, included information on testing and treatment for hepatitis 
C, as well as vaccination policies and administration for hepatitis B. 
                
-------------------------------------------------
Nearly 8 in 10 State prison facilities reported testing
inmates for hepatitis C

State prison facilities reported circumstances under which inmates 
were tested for hepatitis C, including testing all at some time, 
at admission, a random sample, high-risk inmates, upon inmate 
request, and upon clinical indication. Of the 1,584 State prison
facilities reporting in the 2000 Census of Adult State and Federal
Correctional Facilities, 1,209 reported testing inmates for 
hepatitis C; 322 facilities reported no testing of inmates.

As of June 30, 2000, 94% of State inmates were held in facilities 
that tested inmates for hepatitis C: 88% in facilities that tested 
a targeted group (high risk, inmate request, or clinical indication) 
and 6% in facilities that tested a broad group (all at some time, 
at admission, or at random).

About 70% of facilities tested a targeted group, while 9% tested 
more broadly. The largest number of facilities tested inmates based 
on clinical indication of need (1,000), followed by inmate request 
(604), and high-risk indicators (492). The fewest facilities 
reported testing inmates at random (27) or at admission (61).

Only South Carolina reported having no facility that tested for 
hepatitis C. Excluding South Carolina, at least one reception, 
diagnostic, or medical facility in each State reported testing 
inmates.

Nearly a third of hepatitis C tests confirmed
positive

Between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000, 57,018 hepatitis C tests 
were completed in State prisons. About 31% (17,911) of these tests 
were confirmed positive.  

Among facilities that tested a targeted group only, a third of all 
hepatitis C tests were confirmed positive. Among facilities that 
tested more broadly, slightly more than a quarter of all tests were 
confirmed positive.

Hepatitis C tests concentrated in 23 States 

Twenty-three States each reported testing more than 500 inmates 
between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000. Of the 57,018 hepatitis C 
tests performed in State prisons, 52, 813 (93%) were completed in 
those 23 States. California alone accounted for more than a quarter 
(27%) of all tests.  Nearly all of the confirmed positive test 
results (93%) were in these 23 States. 

In the 12-month period ending June 30, 2000, more than 2% of all 
inmates in State prisons tested positive for hepatitis C. Among 
States administering 500 or more hepatitis C tests, 5 reported that 
more than 5% of their inmates were confirmed positive: New Mexico
(16.0%), Montana (9.6%), Massachusetts (9.6%), Connecticut (6.1%), 
and California (5.4%).

-----------------------------------------------------
More than 6,000 inmates in State prisons treated for
hepatitis C in the 12-month period before the census

Of the 1,584 State operated adult correctional facilities, 1,104 
(70%) reported that they had a policy to treat inmates for 
hepatitis C. Facilities most commonly reported a policy to treat 
HCV-positive inmates for whom treatment was recommended.

Between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000, 19 facilities treated 
nearly three-quarters of all inmates receiving treatment for 
hepatitis C. These facilities in 9 States and the District of 
Columbia each reported treating at least 50 inmates for hepatitis 
C. Together these facilities treated 4,382 inmates.

Macon Correctional Institution in Georgia treated 1,300 inmates 
for hepatitis C, 22% of all inmates treated nationwide. Eight 
facilities in California treated 2,344 inmates; more than a third 
of all inmates treated.

Two-thirds of facilities had a policy to vaccinate
inmates for hepatitis B 

On June 30, 2000, 1,033 State prison facilities reported having a 
policy to vaccinate inmates for hepatitis B. These facilities held 
84% of all inmates in State prisons. About 1 in 8 facilities 
reported having a policy to vaccinate all inmates. State prison 
facilities were most likely to report a policy to vaccinate high-
risk inmates (680) and were least likely to report a policy to
vaccinate inmates with sexually transmitted diseases (17). About 
a third of all facilities reported having no hepatitis B 
vaccination.

In the 12 months before the census, 13,655 inmates
completed a 3-dose series vaccination for hepatitis B

More than a third of State facilities (401) that reported having a 
hepatitis B vaccination policy, completed at least one hepatitis B 
3-dose series vaccination. A total of 13,655 inmates were reported 
to have completed a 3-dose series vaccination for hepatitis B in 
the 12-month period ending June 30, 2000.

Of the facilities that reported actually completing at least one 3-
dose series vaccination, 328 had a policy to vaccinate high-risk 
groups, 76 had a policy to vaccinate upon inmate request, and 37 
had a policy to vaccinate all inmates.

Methodology

The 2000 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities 
was the sixth enumeration of State institutions conducted by the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics. Earlier censuses were completed in 
1974, 1979, 1984, 1990, and 1995.  

The facility universe was developed from the 1995 census. Each 
department of corrections was contacted to identify new facilities 
and facilities that had been closed since June 30, 1995. Data were 
collected from all facilities, resulting in a final response rate 
of 100%.

Facilities were included in the census if they had separate 
staffs; housed primarily State or Federal prisoners; were physically, 
functionally, and administratively separate; and operational on June 
30, 2000. Overall, the census identified 84 Federal facilities, 1,295 
State facilities, 22 facilities under State and local authority, 3 
facilities operated by the District of Columbia, and 264 privately 
operated facilities. 

All Federal facilities and 26 privately  operated facilities that 
held at least 50% of their inmates for Federal authorities were 
excluded from this report. Data on testing and treatment for 
hepatitis C and vaccination policies and administration for 
hepatitis B were not reported for these facilities.
