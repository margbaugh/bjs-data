The number of suspects arrested for a federal offense 
declined slightly to 179,489 in fiscal year 2010 after 
reaching a record 181,726 suspects in 2009. The number of 
suspects arrested by federal law enforcement more than 
doubled, from 80,450 in 1994 to 179,489 in 2010 (figure 1).  
In recent years, federal law enforcement activity has 
outpaced the later stages of cases processing in U.S. 
district court (persons charged, convicted, and sentenced to 
prison). From 2006 to 2010, arrests increased at an annual 
average rate of 6%, and matters opened by U.S. attorneys 
(i.e., investigations) increased at an annual average rate of 
9%. In comparison, the number of suspects charged in U.S. 
district court increased at an average annual rate of 3% over 
this period, while both the number of defendants convicted in 
U.S. district court (up 3%) and the number of offenders 
sentenced to prison (up 2%) increased. ***Footnote 1 The 
reporting period used throughout this report is the fiscal 
year, which is from October 1 to September 30. All percent 
changes in this report are calculated using the average of 
the annual change between the two reported years.***

Summary
************

From 2006 to 2010, growth in the enforcement stage (arrest 
and investigation) was due largely to increased arrests for 
illegal entry into the United States. Illegal immigration 
(46%) was the most common arrest offense in 2010, followed by 
drug (16%) and supervision violations (14%). From 2006 to 
2010, immigration arrests increased at the fastest rate (up 
16%), followed by sex (up 10%) and fraud (up 6%) offenses. 
During this period, material witness arrests (down 8%) 
declined the most, followed by regulatory (down 6%) and 
weapons (down 3%) offenses.

The five federal judicial districts along the U.S.-Mexico 
border (California Southern, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas 
Western, and Texas Southern) accounted for 56% of all federal 
arrests in 2010 (map 1), up from 45% of all arrests in 2006 
(not shown). In 2010, these five districts also accounted for 
50% of suspects investigated by U.S. attorneys, 51% of 
suspects detained prior to trial, 36% of defendants in cases 
terminated in U.S. district court, 38% of defendants 
convicted, and 41% of offenders sentenced to federal prison.

In 2010, about 9 in 10 defendants in cases adjudicated in 
U.S. district court were convicted. Ninety-one percent of 
felonies charged in U.S. district court were disposed by a 
guilty plea. Of defendants convicted, about 8 in 10 received 
a prison sentence. The median federal prison sentence imposed 
was 30 months.

At yearend 2010, about 400,000 offenders were under some form 
of federal correctional control: 46% were confined by the 
Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), 16% were confined in 
pretrial detention, 32% were on post-conviction supervision 
in the community, and 7% were under pretrial supervision in 
the community (table 1). Over this period, the number of 
federally sentenced persons in BOP confinement increased by 
23,588, and the number of persons supervised in the community 
increased by 11,864. The number of persons on probation 
decreased from 26,022 in 2005 to 22,685 in 2010.

This report describes defendants processed at each stage of 
the federal justice system—arrest and booking, investigation 
and prosecution, pretrial detention, adjudication and 
sentencing in U.S. district court, corrections, and 
supervision in the community. Data are from the Federal 
Justice Statistics Program (FJSP). The FJSP collects, 
standardizes, and reports on administrative data received 
from six federal justice agencies: the U.S. Marshals Service, 
Drug Enforcement Administration, Administrative Office of the 
U.S. Courts, Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, BOP, and 
the U.S. Sentencing Commission.

*******************
Arrest and booking
*******************

The U.S. Marshal is the primary law enforcement officer for 
the U.S. Marshals Service, and each of the 94 federal 
judicial districts has one. Deputy U.S. Marshals oversee 
tasks involved in taking federal suspects charged with a 
crime into custody, including booking, processing, and 
detention, and other tasks including court security fugitive 
operations, prisoner operations, asset forfeiture, witness 
protection, and prisoner transportation.***Footnote 2 The 
unit of count for federal arrest data reported in this 
section is a suspect arrested and booked by the U.S. Marshals 
Service. The phrase “suspects arrested and booked by the U.S. 
Marshals Service” is used to describe arrests and bookings 
where each arrest and booking for an individual suspect 
occurring in the same year is counted separately.***

************************************
In 2010, the U.S. Marshals Service 
arrested and booked 179,489 suspects 
for a federal offense
************************************

The number of suspects arrested and booked for violations of 
federal law increased from 144,072 in 2006 to 179,489 in 
2010—an average annual increase of 6% per year (table 2). The 
number of suspects arrested and booked increased each year 
from 1994 to 2009 and declined from 2009 to 2010. In 2009, 
181,726 suspects were arrested and booked. The decrease was 
due mostly to fewer immigration and drug suspects arrested 
and booked in 2010 than in 2009 (not shown). 

**************************************
Immigration offenses comprised nearly 
half of federal suspects arrested and 
booked in 2010
**************************************

In 2010, the U.S. Marshals Service arrested and booked 82,438 
immigration suspects. This was an increase of 35,425 
additional immigration suspects arrested and booked compared 
to 2006. Immigration offenses comprised 33% of suspects 
arrested and booked by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2006 and 
46% in 2010. Drug offenses were the second most common 
offense among suspects arrested and booked by the U.S. 
Marshals Service in 2010, as 28,850 (16%) drug suspects were 
arrested and booked. This was down from the 30,229 drug 
suspects arrested and booked in 2006.

************************************
More than half of federal suspects 
were arrested and booked in five 
judicial districts along the U.S.
-Mexico border
************************************
 
In 2010, 101,218 suspects were arrested and booked by the 
U.S. Marshals in southwest border districts (California 
Southern, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas Western, and Texas 
Southern), compared to 78,271 in the remaining 89 districts. 
The district of Arizona had 19% of total federal arrests in 
2010, followed by the Southern District of Texas (17%). From 
2006 to 2010, the number of suspects arrested and booked in 
southwest border districts increased by an annual average of 
12%. In comparison, the number of suspects arrested and 
booked in non-southwest border districts declined by an 
annual average of less than 1% (from 79,527 in 2006 to 78,271 
in 2010). 

************************************
Suspects arrested in the federal 
judicial district of Arizona 
increased at the fastest rate from 
2006 to 2010
************************************

Suspects arrested and booked by the U.S. Marshals service in 
the district of Arizona increased by an annual average of 
27%, from 13,287 in 2006 to 34,085 in 2010. The district of 
Arizona surpassed the Western District of Texas in having the 
most federal arrests in the United States. The district of 
Arizona was followed by Texas Southern (16%), the district of 
New Mexico (11%), and California Southern (10%) as having the 
fastest growing number of federal arrests from 2006 to 2010.

**************************************
From 2006 to 2010, immigration 
offense increased at the fastest rate 
**************************************

Immigration offenses increased by an average of 16% from 2006 
to 2010, making it the fastest growing offense among suspects 
arrested and booked by the U.S. Marshals Service. Immigration 
arrests doubled from 1994 to 1998. Immigration arrests nearly 
doubled from 1998 to 2004, and doubled from 2004 to 2008 
(figure 2). 

From 2006 to 2010, the U.S. Marshals Service arrested and 
booked 346,852 immigration suspects. Ninety percent of 
immigration suspects over this period were arrested in five 
judicial districts along the U.S.-Mexico border (map 2).

*************************************
Sex offenses were the second fastest 
growing federal arrest offense from 
2006 to 2010
*************************************

The number of suspects arrested and booked for a sex offense 
(e.g., child pornography, sex abuse, and illegal sex 
transportation) doubled from 1994 to 1998. Suspects arrested 
for sex offenses doubled again from 1998 to 2004 (figure 3). 
Sex offenses increased by an annual average of 10%, from 
2,129 arrests in 2006 to 3,052 arrests in 2010. 

Suspects arrested and booked for a sex offense were 
relatively dispersed by federal district of arrest. From 2006 
to 2010, U.S. Marshals Service arrested and booked 13,959 sex 
offense suspects. Ten federal districts had more than 300 sex 
offense arrests from 2006 to 2010 (map 3). During this 
period, California Central (433) had the most sex offense 
arrests, followed by Florida Middle (400), the district of 
Arizona (381) and Florida Southern (351).

Recent enforcement initiatives targeting sex offenders 
include the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) Project Safe 
Childhood, which was initiated in 2006 to address the 
expanding use of technology in the sexual exploitation of 
children. The program coordinates enforcement activities 
among U.S. attorney offices, the Child Exploitation and 
Obscenity Section of the Criminal Division in the DOJ, FBI, 
Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Postal Inspection 
Services. 

The DOJ’s Office of Juvenile Justice and Juvenile Delinquency 
Prevention created the Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC 
) task force program in 1998 to help state, local, and 
regional law enforcement agencies acquire the personnel, 
knowledge, and equipment to investigate sexual crimes against 
minors. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act (AWA) 
was passed in 2006 and provided the U.S. Marshals Service the 
mission to investigate registered sex offenders in violation 
of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act and to 
assist state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement 
with apprehending sex offenders. 

In 2008, the Providing Resources, Officers, and Technology to 
Eradicate Cyber Threats to our Children Act of 2008 (PROTECT 
Our Children Act) required the DOJ to create a national 
strategy to combat child exploitation across levels of 
government and the private sector.

************************************
Supervision violations were the 
third most common offense among 
suspects arrested and booked by 
the U.S. Marshals Service in 2010 
************************************

The U.S. Marshals Service arrested and booked 24,344 suspects 
for supervision violations in 2010. Supervision violations 
include violations of bail, probation, post-incarceration 
supervision, and failure to appear. This represented a 4% 
annual average increase since 1994 (12,716). Since 1994, the 
sharpest increase in supervision violations occurred from 
1998 to 2003 (figure 4). From 2003 to 2010, the number of 
suspects arrested and booked for supervision violations 
remained at about 6,000 per quarter. 

The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts oversees the 
supervision of federal offenders in the community. This 
includes persons released prior to trial and persons on 
supervision following conviction. U.S. probation and pretrial 
offices are located in 93 of the 94 federal judicial 
districts and federal pretrial and probation officers monitor 
the compliance of offenders placed on supervision conditions 
ordered by the court. Violations include commission of a new 
federal, state, or local offense or violation of conditions 
of supervision, such as prohibiting the offender from 
possessing guns or other weapons, possession or use of 
illegal drugs, and prohibited contact with victims or 
witnesses. The court may order additional conditions 
depending on the offense and the offender, such as requiring 
that a person in the U.S. illegally be subject to deportation 
as a condition of release of supervision.

From 2006 to 2010, federal supervision violations comprised 
more than a quarter of arrests in five districts (map 4). 
Supervision violations made up 3 in 10 arrests in the 
district of South Dakota and Illinois Southern from 2006 to 
2010. In the districts of Missouri Western, West Virginia 
Southern, and Massachusetts, supervision violations comprised 
27% or more of the total arrests in each district during this 
period. Federal supervision of offenders in the community 
varies from district to district, including the district’s 
workload and the number of officers. Federal districts also 
vary in land area and population concentration among various 
other characteristics that impact supervision.

************************************
DHS law enforcement agencies made 
more than half of federal arrests 
in 2010
************************************

Agencies of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) 
accounted for 55% of suspects arrested and booked by the U.S. 
Marshals Service in 2010 (table 3). DHS agencies include 
Customs Border Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE), the Secret Service, and others. DOJ 
agencies made 41% of suspects arrested and booked by the U.S. 
Marshals Service in 2010. DOJ agencies include the FBI, Drug 
Enforcement Administration (DEA), Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives (ATF), the U.S. Marshals Service, and others.

************************************
Arrests made by DHS law enforcement 
agencies increased at the fastest 
rate from 2006 to 2010
************************************

Arrests by DHS agencies increased at an average annual rate 
of 13% from 2006 to 2010. Arrests made by ICE increased 
annually by 17%, and those made by the CBP increased by 13%. 
Arrests by agencies within the DOJ increased annually by 2% 
from 2006 to 2010, with the FBI arrests increasing by 4% and 
the U.S. Marshals Service arrests increasing by 2%. Arrests 
made by ATF declined by 1%. 

Differences in the arrest activity of law enforcement 
agencies relate to the types of arrest offenses. An increase 
in the number of immigration offenses corresponds to growth 
in the number of arrests made by the DHS law enforcement 
agencies that have exclusive jurisdiction over immigration 
enforcement. Similarly, the 3% average decline in the number 
of weapons arrests from 2006 to 2010 generally corresponds 
with the 1% average decline in the number of arrests made by 
ATF, which has primary investigative responsibility over 
firearm offenses.

************************************
Arrests made by Interior, Defense, 
the Federal Judiciary, and other 
agencies declined from 2006 to 2010
************************************

In 2010, 2,780 arrests were made by other law enforcement 
agencies (including state and local task forces and self-
commitments), down from 10,037 arrests in 2006. Arrests made 
by law enforcement agencies within Interior, Defense, and the 
Federal Judiciary each declined from 2006 to 2010. Law 
enforcement agencies from Agriculture, State, Treasury, and 
the U.S. Postal Service each increased over this period.

**************************************************

******************************
Patterns in DEA drug arrests
*******************************

************************************
In 2010, the number of drug arrests 
by the DEA increased to its highest 
level since 2001
************************************

Based on data from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), 
there were 31,169 arrests for drug offenses in 
2010.***Footnote 3  The unit of count for the federal drug 
arrest data received from the Drug Enforcement Administration 
reported in this section is a suspect arrested by the Drug 
Enforcement Administration. The phrase “suspects arrested by 
the DEA” is used to describe arrests where each arrest for an 
individual suspect is counted separately. Individual suspects 
can be arrested and booked by the DEA more than once in a 
year. The DEA data do not distinguish between arrests which 
are referred for state versus federal prosecution.*** The 
number of drug arrests by the DEA increased over the 1990s to 
a peak of 38,886 arrests in 1999, followed by a decline to 
26,850 in 2003 and an increase to 29,886 in 2005 (not shown).
 
Marijuana arrests by the DEA increased at the fastest annual 
average rate from 2002 to 2010 (6%), followed by opiates (3%) 
(figure 5). The number of DEA arrests for marijuana coincided 
with the number of arrests for methamphetamine until 2007, 
when the number of marijuana arrests increased at a faster 
rate through 2010.

************************************
Cocaine was the most common drug 
type involved in arrests by the 
DEA in 2010
************************************

Suspects arrested for offenses involving cocaine powder 
(8,134) and crack cocaine (2,620) accounted for 35% of all 
suspects arrested by the DEA in 2010 (table 4). Twenty-six 
percent of suspects were arrested for offenses involving 
cocaine powder, and 8% were arrested for crack cocaine. The 
remaining suspects arrested by the DEA in 2010 were for 
marijuana (8,117), methamphetamine (5,460), opiates (3,001), 
and other or nondrug offenses (3,837). Marijuana was the 
second most common drug at arrest by the DEA from 2006 to 
2010, compared to methamphetamine from 1998 to 2005.

************************************
Hispanic suspects comprised nearly 
half (49%) of suspects arrested by 
the DEA in 2010
************************************

In 2010, about half (49%) of suspects arrested by the DEA 
were of Hispanic origin, followed by white (25%) and black 
(23%) suspects. Hispanic suspects were involved in 6 in 10 
arrests for cocaine powder (60%) and methamphetamine (59%), 
and over half of arrests for marijuana (55%) offenses. Over 
three-quarters (80%) of crack cocaine suspects were black, 
and over half of other or nondrug suspects were white (54%).
 
************************************
Most suspects arrested by the DEA 
in 2010 were male 
************************************

Eighty-five percent of suspects arrested by the DEA were 
male. Females accounted for 15% of all DEA drug arrests and 
20% of all methamphetamine arrests. Half of all suspects 
arrested by the DEA were age 32 or younger, and the median 
age was similar across all drug types. Four percent of 
arrests by the DEA were of suspects over age 55.

************************************
In 2010, most females arrested by 
the DEA were white, while most 
males were Hispanic
************************************

For both males and females, the Hispanic proportion of DEA 
arrests dropped in the early 1990s and has increased since 
then. Among females arrested by the DEA in 2010, 42% were 
white, 36% were Hispanic, and 18% were black. White females 
almost always had the greatest share of female DEA arrests. 
The percentage of black female arrests by the DEA increased 
from 25% in 1994 to 31% in 1995, and declined to 18% in 2010 
(figure 6).
 
************************************
Among males arrested by the DEA in 
2010, over half were Hispanic
************************************

For the first time since 1994, Hispanics comprised the 
majority (51%) of male arrests by the DEA in 2010. This 
represented a gradual growth in the Hispanic share of male 
arrests (up from 40% in 2000). Black males comprised 24% of 
arrests of males by the DEA in 2010, and whites comprised 23% 
of males arrested (figure 7).
**************************************************

************
Prosecution
************

The 93 U.S. attorneys serve as the chief federal law 
enforcement officers within their respective districts.4 In 
2010, there were 94 headquarter offices and 138 staffed 
branch offices in the U.S. attorney system. The U.S. 
attorney, with help from assistant U.S. attorneys and support 
personnel, are responsible for most of the federal criminal 
prosecution conducted each year. In 2010, there were 6,075 
full time equivalent (FTE) attorneys and 5,799 FTE support 
staff (U.S. Attorneys’ Annual Statistical Report, Fiscal Year 
2010, available at 
http://www.justice.gov/usao/reading_room/reports/asr2010/10st
atrpt.pdf). Investigations are most commonly referred to a 
U.S. attorney by a federal law enforcement agency. State and 
local law enforcement agencies are also sources of criminal 
referrals to U.S. attorney’s offices in their district. U.S. 
attorneys determine which cases they will prosecute and 
establish policies and priorities within their federal 
judicial districts. U.S. attorneys take into account a 
variety of factors such as DOJ priorities, available 
resources, state and local priorities, and law enforcement 
priorities. The national priorities for U.S. attorneys in 
2010 included the disruption and prevention of terrorism, 
drug trafficking, firearms enforcement, corporate fraud, 
civil rights, crimes against children, and official 
corruption.

Federal legislation influences the work of federal 
prosecutors, especially the agencies from which they receive 
referrals. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the 
U.S. Customs Service and the Secret Service from the U.S. 
Department of Treasury (Treasury) to DHS. Responsibility for 
the Immigration and Naturalization Service transferred from 
the DOJ to DHS, and the ATF transferred from the Treasury to 
the DOJ.

***************************************
From 2006 to 2010, criminal referrals 
to U.S. attorneys increased the fastest 
in southwest border districts
***************************************

Between 2006 and 2010, the number of matters concluded by 
U.S. attorneys increased from 141,130 to 193,021—an annual 
average percent increase of 9%. The percent change in the 
number of matters referred to U.S. attorneys from 2005 to 
2010 averaged more than 45% per year in nine federal judicial 
districts (map 5). In addition to the five Southwest border 
districts (California Southern, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas 
Western and Texas Southern), the districts of Iowa Northern, 
Wyoming, Missouri Western, and Tennessee Middle, each 
experienced an average annual increase in referrals of more 
than 45%. The Western District of North Carolina and the 
Middle District of Georgia experienced declines in the 
average annual percent change of referrals by more than 40%.

The reasons for changes in the number of referrals between 
2006 and 2010 varied by district, with the exception of 
districts along the U.S.-Mexico border. The number of 
districts along the U.S.-Mexico border increased due to 
greater immigration enforcement (not shown). The growth in 
Montana was due to an increase in referrals from the National 
Park Service for regulatory offenses in national parks. The 
growth in Iowa Northern was due to a 1-year (2008) spike in 
immigration referrals. In North Carolina Western, the decline 
in referrals was mostly due to fewer weapons and drug 
referrals from 2006 to 2010. In Georgia Middle, the decline 
in referrals was mostly due to fewer drug trafficking 
referrals from 2006 to 2010.

*************************************
In 2010, 54% of suspects in matters 
concluded by U.S. attorneys had been 
referred by the Department 
of Homeland Security
*************************************

Eight years after the reorganization of federal law 
enforcement agencies under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 
(Public Law 107-296), DHS agencies referred 54% of all 
matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2010, up from 36% of 
matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2006 (table 5). Law 
enforcement agencies within the DOJ referred 30% of suspects 
in matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2010, compared to 
42% of referrals in 2006 and 57% referrals in 2001. Suspects 
in matters concluded by U.S. attorneys referred by the 
Treasury comprised 1% of the all matters concluded in 2010, 
down from 2% in 2006 and 20% in 2002.

*************************************
Immigration and drug charges made up 
two-thirds of all matters concluded 
by U.S. attorneys in 2010
*************************************

U.S. attorneys concluded 193,021 matters in 2010 (table 6). 
Forty-five percent of matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 
2010 involved an immigration offense, and 20% involved a drug 
charge. Overall, the number of matters concluded increased by 
an annual average of 9% from 2006 to 2010. Among matters 
concluded by U.S. attorneys during this period, immigration 
(30%) and sex offenses (9%) increased at the fastest annual 
rate. The number of weapon offenses decreased by an annual 
average of 4%, from 12,887 matters concluded in 2006 to 
11,040 in 2010.

************************************
Matters concluded in five federal 
judicial districts along the U.S.
-Mexico border increased by 25% 
from 2006 to 2010
************************************

Half (50%) of matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2010 
occurred in the five federal judicial districts of California 
Southern, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas Western and Texas 
Southern.  In comparison, these districts handled about a 
third (31%) of matters concluded in 2006. The number of 
matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in all other districts 
decreased slightly, from 97,202 matters in 2006 to 96,924 
matters in 2010.

************************************
Almost half of suspects in matters 
concluded in 2010 were prosecuted 
by U.S. attorneys
************************************

Matters involving drug and weapons offenses were the most 
likely to be prosecuted in 2010. Suspects charged with drug 
(75%) and weapons (69%) offenses had the highest prosecution 
rates in 2010, followed by sex (57%), violent (56%), property 
(50%), and public order (40%) offenses (table 7). 

U.S. attorneys may file charges and prosecute defendants in 
U.S. district court, or they may file charges and prosecute 
matters before U.S. magistrates, who have the authority to 
adjudicate misdemeanor offenses (18 U.S.C. § 3401). With the 
exception of misdemeanor offenses and when a suspect waives 
their right to a grand jury indictment, the U.S. attorney 
presents evidence to a grand jury. The grand jury deliberates 
and decides whether the suspect should be indicted or charged 
for committing a crime. If the grand jury returns with an 
indictment, the U.S. attorney will file criminal charges in 
U.S. district court.

************************************
More than a third of federal matters 
concluded in 2010 were disposed 
by U.S. magistrates
************************************

Thirty-six percent of matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 
2010 were disposed by U.S. magistrates, while 49% were 
handled in U.S. districts courts and 16% were declined for 
further prosecution. U.S. magistrates disposed 64% of 
immigration matters, 26% of public order matters, and 15% of 
fraud matters concluded. In the five U.S.-Mexico border 
districts, more than half (61%) of matters concluded by U.S. 
attorneys were disposed by U.S. magistrates, compared to 10% 
of matters in other districts. Suspects involved in 
regulatory offenses were most likely to be declined for 
prosecution (47%), followed by property (36%), violent (34%), 
and public order (34%) offenses. The U.S. attorney may 
decline to file charges for reasons such as weak or 
insufficient evidence, a lack of criminal intent, minimal 
federal interest, or a lack of resources. Matters that are 
declined may be referred to other authorities for prosecution 
or may be settled through alternative resolution procedures.

************************************
The median time to conclude a matter 
(from receipt to U.S. attorneys’ 
decision) was 19 days
************************************

The median days from receipt of a matter to the decision by 
U.S. attorneys to either prosecute, dispose by U.S. 
magistrate, or decline was 19 days for all matters concluded 
in 2010. The median case processing time varied by type of 
offense with fraud (222 days) and regulatory (214 days) 
offenses taking the longest to reach a resolution. The median 
case processing time for immigration (2 days) and drug (29 
days) offenses took the shortest time to reach a resolution.

************************************
Matters prosecuted in 2010 took a 
median of 24 days to process (from 
receipt of matter to U.S. attorneys’ 
decision)
************************************

Among offenses prosecuted in 2010, fraud offenses took the 
longest (a median of 95 days) to reach the prosecution 
decision. Immigration (21 days) and other public order (16 
days) offenses received a prosecution decision in the 
shortest time.

***************************************
In 2010, the median case time was 
longest for matters that were declined
***************************************

Matters that were declined for prosecution took a median 444 
days, compared with matters that were prosecuted (24 days) 
and matters that were disposed by U.S. magistrate (0 days). A 
median of 0 days means that at least half of the matters were 
disposed by U.S. magistrates on the same day they were 
opened. Among those that were declined in 2010, property (537 
days) and drug (511 days) matters took the longest time to 
reach declination. Matters that were declined in 2010 in 
U.S.-Mexico border districts (433 days) took a similar  
duration other districts (445 days).

************************************
Case processing time decreased from 
over 3 months in 1994 to about 
3 weeks in 2010
************************************

The median time from the receipt of a matter by a U.S. 
attorney’s office to a decision to prosecute, decline, or 
dispose by U.S. magistrate was 19 days in 2010. This was a 
decrease from 90 days in 1994. In 2010, the median processing 
time took far longer for matters that were declined (median 
of 444 days) than for matters prosecuted (24 days) or 
disposed by a U.S. magistrate (0 days). The median case 
processing time for matters prosecuted remained relatively 
stable, declining slightly from 26 days in 1994 to 24 days in 
2010 (figure 8). The case processing time for a matter 
disposed by magistrate increased from 28 days in 1994 to 66 
days in 2002, before dropping sharply to a median of 0 days 
in 2010. A median of 0 days means that at least half of the 
matters were concluded on the same day they were opened.
 
The drop in the total case processing time was due in part to 
a steady decrease in the number of matters declined, and an 
increase in the number of immigration matters disposed by 
U.S. magistrate beginning in 2004. In addition, the increase 
in immigration enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border was 
accompanied by a strategy to expedite case processing by 
charging first-time illegal entrants with a petty misdemeanor 
offense. As a result, the average case processing time 
decreased.

**************************************
Five investigative agencies referred 
77% of matters concluded in 2010
**************************************

Seventy-seven percent (149,392) of the 193,021 matters 
concluded U.S. attorneys in 2010 were referred by five 
investigative agencies (table 8). The top two agencies were 
from DHS: CBP (73,488) and ICE (23,653). The other three were 
from DOJ agencies: FBI (23,132), DEA (17,682), and ATF 
(11,437).

Among these five agencies, prosecution rates in 2010 varied 
from a high of 80% for suspects referred by ICE and 78% for 
UCIS, followed by 77% for suspects referred by DEA and 70% 
for suspects referred by ATF. Twenty-four percent of suspects 
referred by CBP were prosecuted in U.S. district courts, and 
76% of suspects were disposed by U.S. magistrates. The FBI 
had a prosecution rate of 56%, and 5% of suspects were 
disposed by U.S. magistrate. These five agencies differed in 
the days from receipt of matter to the decision to prosecute. 
The FBI had an 8-week median case processing time, compared 
to 3 to 4 weeks for the other four agencies. 

************************************
Pretrial detention, adjudication, 
and sentencing
************************************

The terms for release and detention of defendants facing 
charges in federal courts are set under Title 18 U.S.C. § 
3141. According to the statute, a defendant must be brought 
before a judicial officer without unnecessary delay upon 
arrest for an initial appearance. The judicial officer, 
usually a U.S. magistrate, determines whether the defendant 
will be released or detained prior to trial. The Bail Reform 
Act of 1984 requires the court to weigh risk of flight, 
threat of crime commission, and presumption of innocence in 
deciding whether to order detention or release of a 
defendant. According to the act, preventive detention is 
applicable in instances where the defendant was charged with 
(1) a crime of violence, (2) an offense with a statutory 
maximum sentence of life imprisonment or death, (3) a drug 
offense with a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years or more 
imprisonment, or (4) any felony offense if the defendant had 
been convicted on two or more occasions of a previously 
described offense or a similar state-level offense. 

************************************
Immigration defendants were most 
likely to be detained prior to case 
disposition
************************************

In 2010, more than 3 in 4 defendants (76%) in cases 
terminated had been detained by the court prior to case 
disposition (table 9). The defendants most likely to be 
detained were those charged with immigration (88%), violent 
(86%), weapons (86%), and drug (84%) offenses. Immigration 
defendants comprised 39% of all defendants in cases 
terminated in 2010 and 45% of all defendants detained prior 
to case disposition. Property (41%) and public order (43%) 
defendants were less likely than other defendants to be 
detained. In comparison, 72% of defendants charged with a sex 
offense were detained prior to case disposition.

*************************************
The likelihood of being detained 
prior to case disposition increased 
with the number of prior convictions 
*************************************

Eighty-seven percent of defendants with five or more prior 
convictions were detained, compared to 82% of defendants with 
two to four prior convictions and 78% with one prior 
conviction. Defendants with no prior convictions (67%) were 
the least likely to be detained. The likelihood of being 
detained also increased with the severity of the defendant’s 
criminal history. Eighty-nine percent of defendants with a 
prior violent felony conviction were detained by the court, 
compared to defendants with only prior nonviolent and nondrug 
felony (79%) or misdemeanor (75%) convictions. Eighty-three 
percent of defendants charged in districts along the U.S.-
Mexico border were detained prior to case disposition in 
2010, while the detention rates in other districts averaged 
70%.

************************************
Immigration offenses nearly equaled 
the number of drug cases filed in 
U.S. district court in 2010 
************************************

Immigration offenses increased from 2,453 cases filed in 
1994, to 29,016 in 2010—nearly equaling the number of drug 
offenses in cases filed in 2010 (29,493). Immigration 
offenses accounted for 70% of the total increase among all 
felony cases filed from 1994 to 2010 (figure 9). After 
increasing from 21,871 cases filed in 1994 to 32,897 cases 
filed in 2003, drug offenses declined to 29,493 in 2010. 
Weapons offenses increased from 3,557 cases filed in 1994 to 
a peak of 10,278 in 2004. Since 2004, the number of weapons 
cases filed in U.S. district court declined to 7,989 in 2010.

**************************************
More than half of defendants charged 
in U.S. district courts in 2010 were 
of Hispanic origin
**************************************

In 2010, most defendants charged in U.S. district court were 
Hispanic (57%), male (86%), and ages 30 to 34 (19%) (table 
10). Defendants age 50 or older comprised 12% of defendants 
charged. The youngest (age 19 or younger) and oldest 
defendants (age 65 or older) together comprised 3% of 
defendants charged in 2010.

****************************************
Males made up most (86%) of defendants 
charged in U.S. district court in 2010 
****************************************

Males comprised 86% of defendants charged in federal court in 
2010. Most males charged were of Hispanic origin (60%), 
followed by white (20%) and black or African American (18%). 
In comparison, most females charged were of Hispanic origin 
(42%), followed by white (33%) and black or African American 
(20%). The median age for males (34 years) was similar to 
females (35 years). Females charged were mostly U.S. citizens 
(76%), with 5% having legal alien status and 19% having 
illegal alien status.

************************************
Non-U.S. citizens comprised nearly 
half (47%) of defendants charged 
in U.S. district court in 2010
************************************

In 2010, 47% of defendants charged in U.S. district courts 
were non-U.S. citizens, while 53% were U.S. citizens. 
Noncitizens charged included persons with legal status (5%) 
(i.e., permanent residents, persons in possession of a green 
card, persons with a valid temporary visa, and persons with 
refugee status) and persons in the country without legal 
authorization (42%). Thirty-six percent of defendants charged 
in U.S. district court were from Mexico, followed by persons 
from Central America (4%), the Caribbean (2%), and South 
America (1%) (figure 10). Defendants from Asia and Oceania, 
Europe, and Africa together represented 1% of defendants 
charged in U.S. district court.

****************************************
In 2010, 9 in 10 defendants adjudicated
in U.S. district court were convicted 
****************************************

Of the 98,489 defendants adjudicated in 2010, 91% 
(89,902)were convicted (table 11). Almost all immigration 
violation defendants (97%) in 2010 were convicted, as were 
most defendants with weapons (92%) and drug (93%) violations. 
Of the 89,902 of adjudicated defendants convicted in 2010, 
most (97%) were convicted following a guilty plea.

************************************
8% of adjudicated defendants were 
dismissed in 2010
************************************

Misdemeanants had the highest percentage of dismissals, (26%) 
followed by public order (11%) and other property offenses 
(10%). Violent offenses (7%) and regulatory offenses (6%) had 
the highest percentage of trials. In 2010, defendants 
adjudicated in the southwest districts had a higher 
conviction rate (96%) than defendants in districts not 
located on the border (89%). Dismissals (205 days) and guilty 
pleas (188 days) took less time to process than trials ending 
in conviction (464 days) or ending in acquittal (237 days).

**************************************
In 2010, a felony case took a median 
of 211 days to process from filing 
to disposition
**************************************

The median case processing time for felonies from case filing 
to disposition increased from 197 days in 1994 to 211 days in 
2010 (figure 11). Guilty pleas comprised 89% of the case 
outcomes. The overall trend in felony case time is most 
impacted by guilty pleas, which comprise the bulk of case 
disposition outcomes. The median case processing time of 
felony cases terminated by a guilty plea increased by 9 days, 
from 184 days in 1994 to 203 days in 2010. 

**************************************
Cases terminated by a bench or jury 
trial decision took the longest time 
to process from 1994 to 2010
**************************************

In 2010, felony cases terminated by a trial took a median of 
454 days, a 67% increase from 274 days in 1994. Cases 
terminated by dismissal took a median of 294 days in 2010, up 
from 223 days in 1994 or a 32% increase in median case 
processing time. 

The number of cases terminated with a trial declined. For 
example, the number of defendants who were found guilty 
following a trial declined by an annual average of 7% from 
2006 to 2010, and the number of defendants who were found not 
guilty at trial decreased by 5%. The number of guilty pleas 
increased by an average annual rate of 3% from 2006 to 2010, 
followed by case dismissals (2%) (table 12). 

************************************
78% of convicted defendants were 
sentenced to prison in 2010
************************************

Of the 89,902 defendants convicted in U.S. district court in 
2010, 78% (69,494) were sentenced to prison. This percentage 
was down from the 80% of convicted defendants who were 
sentenced to prison in 2006. The number of persons who were 
sentenced to prison increased from 63,699 in 2006 to 69,494 
in 2010, an annual average growth of 2%. 

Eleven percent of convicted defendants in 2010 were sentenced 
to a term of probation only, down from 13% in 2006. Persons 
sentenced to probation decreased from 9,876 in 2006 to 9,627 
in 2010. Three percent of defendants were ordered only to pay 
a fine in 2010. Persons receiving a fine-only sentence 
increased from 2,314 in 2006 to 2,758 in 2010. The fastest 
growing outcome at sentencing from 2006 to 2010 was the 
suspended sentence, which increased an annual average of 23%. 
In 2010, about 8% of all convicted defendants received a 
suspended sentence, up from 4% in 2006. 

**************************************
The percent of felony cases disposed 
ending in a guilty plea varied 
by district
**************************************

In 2010, eight federal districts disposed of felony cases 
with a guilty plea at least 95% of the time (map 6). This 
included districts along the southwest border (with the 
exception of California Southern) and the districts of 
Wyoming (96%), Illinois Southern (96%), North Carolina Middle 
(95%), and Louisiana Eastern (95%). 

************************************
In 2010, the median time from case 
filing to guilty plea was about 
6 months
************************************

Of the 87,567 defendants in cases terminated in 2010 that 
ended in a guilty plea, the time from case filing to plea was 
about 6 months (figure 12). Defendants pleading guilty to a 
felony drug (301 days) or a felony public order offense (300 
days) took the longest to reach disposition, followed by 
defendants pleading guilty to a felony sex (271 days), felony 
weapons (268 days), and felony violent offense (261 days). 
Defendants pleading guilty to a felony immigration offense 
took 120 days from case filing to case termination. 
Defendants pleading guilty to a misdemeanor took 39 days, 
compared with defendants pleading guilty to a felony (203 
days). Defendants pleading guilty in districts along the 
U.S.-Mexico border (126 days) were quicker to reach 
disposition than defendants pleading guilty in other 
districts (247 days).

**************************************
Defendants convicted of sex offenses 
were most likely to receive a prison 
sentence 
**************************************

In 2010, sex offense convictions were most likely to receive 
a prison sentence (96%), followed by violent (93%) and 
weapons (92%) offenses (table 13). Defendants convicted of 
regulatory public order offenses (51%) and other property 
offenses (49%) were least likely to receive a prison 
sentence. Defendants convicted in one of the five districts 
along the U.S.-Mexico border (84%) were more likely to 
receive a prison sentence than defendants in all other 
districts (74%). 

************************************
Median prison terms declined 
from 2006 to 2010
************************************

The median prison sentence decreased from 37 months in 2006 
to 31 months in 2010. Drug offenders received a median prison 
sentence of 60 months in 2010, down from 63 months in 2006. 
Violent offenders received a median of 63 months in prison in 
2010, down 64 months in 2006. Weapons offenders received a 
median sentence of 60 months in 2010, unchanged from 2006. 
The median prison sentence decreased for immigration 
offenders, from 21 months in 2006 to 15 months in 2010.

************************************
Median prison sentences for 
defendants convicted of sex 
offenses had the greatest increase 
************************************

Defendants convicted and sentenced to prison for a felony sex 
offense had the greatest median prison sentence in 2010 (84 
months), up from a median term of 36 months in 1994 (figure 
13). From 1994 to 2010, the median prison term imposed on sex 
offenders increased by annual average of 6%. In comparison, 
the median prison term imposed for violent, weapons, and drug 
offenses remained relatively stable over the same period. The 
median prison term imposed for immigration offenses decreased 
from 24 months in 1994 to 15 months in 2010.

************************************
Corrections and post-conviction 
supervision
************************************

************************************
Most persons were incarcerated 
in federal prison for a drug 
offense in 2010
************************************

Drug offenses were the most prevalent offense type of 
prisoners in federal prison on September 30, 2010 (figure 
14). Drug offenders declined from 57% of the prison 
population in 2001 to 52% in 2010, while weapons offenders 
increased from 9% of the prison population in 2001 to 16% in 
2010. The share of violent offenders in federal prison 
decreased from 9% in 2001 to 6% in 2010. Immigration 
offenders comprised 12% of the prison population in 2010, 
rising slightly from of 11% of the prison population in 2001.

************************************
Males made up 93% of inmates in 2010 
************************************

The rate of growth from 1994 to 2010 was similar for males 
and females, averaging about a 3–4% annual increase (table 
14). The percentage of males (93%) in federal prison on 
September 30, 2010, was unchanged from the percentage of 
males in prison on September 30, 1994. 

************************************
Federal prisons housed a greater 
share of older prisoners in 2010 
************************************

The median age of prisoners was 38 years in 2010, compared to 
a median age of 36 years in 2001 (table 14). The number of 
prisoners age 65 or older increased from 1,698 prisoners in 
2001 to 3,534 prisoners in 2010. Offenders age 60 or older 
comprised about 4% of the total prison population in 2010. 
Prisoners age 29 or younger decreased from 37,439 in 1994 to 
36,918 in 2010, (down 1%).

************************************
The racial profile of the federal 
prison population showed little 
change from 2006 to 2010
************************************

In 2010, 37% of the federal prison population was black or 
African American, 32% was Hispanic, and 28% was white. 
American Indians and Asians each represented 3% of the prison 
population. Seventy-four percent of persons in federal prison 
at fiscal yearend 2010 were U.S. citizens, up from 71% in 
2001 (figure 15). Of the 26% non-U.S. citizens in federal 
prison in 2010, 18% were citizens of Mexico, 3% were citizens 
of Caribbean countries, 2% were citizens of Central America, 
and 2% were citizens of South American countries. Non-U.S. 
citizens in federal prison at fiscal yearend 2010 with 
citizenship in a Central American country increased by an 
annual average of 9% from 2001 to 2010. In comparison, the 
average annual growth in prisoners who were citizens of 
Mexico was 4%. Five federal judicial districts (Arizona, 
Texas Western, Texas Southern, Florida Southern, and Florida 
Middle) committed 22% of offenders in federal prison at 
yearend 2010 (map 7).

**************************************************
************************************
Offenders returning to federal 
prison from 1998 to 2010
************************************

14% of offenders released from federal prison in 2008 
returned to federal prison within 3 years
Of the 59,391 offenders first released from federal prison in 
2008 following a U.S. district court commitment, 14% were 
readmitted to federal prison within 3 years (figure 16). Four 
percent of offenders released in 2010 returned to federal 
prison within 1 year, 10% of offenders released in 2009 
returned to federal prison with 2 years, 14% of offenders 
released in 2008 were returned to federal prison within 3 
years, 17% of offenders released in 2007 were returned within 
4 years, and, 20% of offenders released in 2006 were returned 
to federal prison within 5 years. These recidivism 
percentages do not take into account the recidivism of 
offenders who after release from federal prison were 
imprisoned in a state prison for a new offense.

************************************
Supervision violations were the 
most common reason for return to 
prison within 3 years
************************************

The most common reason for federal prisoners released in 2008 
to return to federal prison within 3 years was violation of 
conditions of supervision (59%). Returns for a new court 
commitment or new offense comprised 39% of returns (table 
15). 

************************************
Return-to-prison rates were highest 
for younger released offenders
************************************

Offenders between the ages 18 and 24 released in 2008 had a 
3-year return-to-prison rate of 20%. Of these returns, 55% 
was for a supervision violation and 44% was for a new court 
commitment. Among released prisoners ages 25 to 44, 15% 
returned to prison within 3 years. Released prisoners ages 45 
to 64 had a 9% return to prison rate, followed by 3% for 
prisoners age 65 or older. 

******************************************
Males had a 15% 3-year return-to-prison 
rate, compared to 9% for female offenders 
******************************************

Among males who were released from federal prison in 2008 and 
returned, 58% returned for violations of supervision, and 41% 
returned for a new court commitment. In comparison, 80% of 
females returned to prison for supervision, violations, and 
19% returned with a new court commitment.

*************************************
Native American prisoners had the 
highest 3-year return to prison rate 
among all racial groups
*************************************

Thirty-nine percent of Native Americans released from federal 
prison in 2008 returned to federal prison within 3 years. 
Eighty-seven percent of Native Americans returned for a 
violation of supervision, and 13% returned for a new court 
commitment. Black prisoners had the second highest 3-year 
return to prison rate (19%), with 82% returned for 
supervision violations and 14% returned for a new court 
commitment. Whites had a 13% return rate, Hispanics had a 12% 
return rate, and Asians had a 6% return rate.

************************************
Violent and weapons offenders 
returned to prison at higher 
rates than other offenders
************************************

The 3-year return to prison rate was highest for violent and 
weapons offenders (27% each) (figure 17). Violent (80%) and 
weapons (85%) offenders were most likely to be returned for 
supervision violations. Immigration offenders were most 
likely to be returned for a new offense (83%). As most 
immigrations offenders were deported after serving a federal 
sentence, most who returned did so for illegally reentering 
the United States among other new offenses.

************************************
Immigration offenders were most 
likely to return to federal prison 
within 3 years of release
************************************

Fourteen percent of immigration offenders released in 2008 
were returned to federal prison within 3 years of release, 
representing 33% of all recidivists over the time period. In 
comparison, 29% of recidivists were drug offenders and 6% 
were violent offenders.  Immigration had the highest 
percentage of new offenses as a reason for return to federal 
prison (83%). Seventeen percent of immigration returns were 
due to supervision violations. Immigration was the most 
common offense type of returns for new offenses. 

The 3-year recidivism rate for drug offenders was 11%.  
Twenty-one percent of drug offenders were returned for a new 
offense, and 74% were returned for a supervision violation.  
Public order offenses had the lowest 3-year return to prison 
rate (10%). Eighteen percent of public order offenders were 
returned for a new offense, and 81% were returned for a 
supervision violation.  

************************************
18% of U.S. citizens and 10% of 
non-U.S. citizens released in 2008 
eturned to federal prison within 
3 years
************************************

Non-U.S. citizens had a lower return rate (10%) than U.S. 
citizens (18%).  The lower risk of return for non-U.S. 
citizens may be a function of differences in how non-U.S. 
citizen offenders are handled following release. Most non-
U.S. citizens are deported immediately after serving a 
federal prison term. Noncitizens may then be deported or 
detained pending deportation by ICE. A small share of 
noncitizens is released to serve terms of federal 
supervision, so most noncitizens would not be at risk to 
return to prison for technical violations of supervision. 
About 9 in 10 noncitizens who returned to prison in a 3-year 
period following release were recommitted for a new court 
commitment, and 1 in 10 were returned for a supervision 
violation.

************************************
Districts with the greatest 3-year 
return to prison rate for new court 
commitments only were clustered in 
the west and southwestern U.S.
************************************

The districts of California Southern, Arizona, and Texas 
Southern had 3-year return to prison rates for a new offense 
between 12% and 14% in 2010 (map 8). In 2010, eight districts 
had 3-year return to prison rates between 21% and 26% for 
supervision violations (map 9). Three of these districts are 
adjacent to one another: Montana, North Dakota, and South 
Dakota.

************************************
At fiscal yearend 2010, a total of 
126,554 offenders were under active 
federal post-conviction supervision
************************************

Eighty-two percent of offenders under federal post-conviction 
supervision received one of two forms of supervision 
following release from prison: supervised release (101,839) 
or parole (2,030) (table 16). The remainder (22,685) were on 
probation supervision, which is a sentence to a term of 
supervision in the community with and without a confinement 
sentence. Among the 126,554 offenders under federal 
supervision at fiscal yearend 2010, 81% were male and 19% 
were female. Females comprised 36% of offenders on probation 
and 3% of offenders on parole supervision. White offenders 
comprised the largest share on supervision (37%), followed by 
black (36%) and Hispanic (21%) offenders. Black offenders 
comprised 38% of offenders on supervised release, and white 
offenders made up nearly half (49%) of offenders on 
probation.

*************************************
5% of persons under federal post-
conviction supervised release in 
the community were non-U.S. citizens
*************************************

In 2010, 5% of offenders under federal supervision were non-
U.S. citizens. Hispanics comprised 21% of offenders under 
community supervision, followed by white (37%) and black 
(36%) offenders. The median age was similar for offenders 
under supervised release (age 39) and probation (age 40), but 
higher for persons on parole supervision (age 51).
Drug and property fraud comprised the two most common 
offenses for offenders under federal supervision in 2001 and 
in 2010 (figure 18). The percentage of weapons offenders 
under federal supervision increased from 2001 and 2010, as 
did drug and immigration offenses.

Methodology
************

The Federal Justice Statistics 
Program (FJSP)
*******************************

This report uses data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ 
(BJS) Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP). The FJSP was 
initiated in 1982 to serve as a central resource for 
information describing the case processing of federal 
criminal defendants and to meet BJS’s statutory mandate to 
“collect, analyze, and disseminate comprehensive federal 
justice transaction statistics … and to provide technical 
assistance to and work jointly with other federal agencies to 
improve the availability and quality of federal justice 
data”—42 U.S.C. 3732 (c) (15). 

The FJSP receives administrative data files from six federal 
criminal justice agencies and standardizes this information 
to maximize comparability across agencies and within agencies 
over time. This includes (1) applying, where possible, 
person–case as the primary unit of count (exceptions include 
at arrest where the unit of count is the individual suspect, 
sentencing under federal sentencing guidelines where the unit 
of count is the sentencing event, and at imprisonment where 
the unit of count is the inmate); (2) delineating fiscal year 
(October 1 through September 30) as the period for reported 
events; (3) applying a uniform offense classification across 
agencies; and (4) classifying disposition and sentences 
imposed. 

Where more than one offense is charged or adjudicated, the 
most serious offense at disposition and sentencing is used. 
Offense seriousness is based on maximum statutory 
imprisonment term, type of crime, and statutory maximum fine 
amount. Annual cross-sectional data files are produced and 
maintained by and represent the federal criminal case 
processing stages from arrest and prosecution through 
pretrial release, adjudication, sentencing, appeals, and 
corrections.
 
FJSP data sources
*******************

The U.S. Marshals Service Prisoner Tracking System (PTS) 
provides information on suspects arrested for federal 
offenses and booked by the U.S. Marshals Service following an 
arrest. Suspects may be counted more than once in a fiscal 
year if they are arrested and booked multiple times during 
the period. The U.S. Marshals Service uses the PTS to track 
federal prisoners in Marshals’ custody. The U.S. Marshals 
Service provides data from the Justice Detainee Information 
System (JDIS). The JDIS consolidates information on prisoners 
who are in Marshals Service custody or who have a federal 
arrest warrant issued. 

The Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys’ National Legal 
Information Office Network System (LIONS) database contains 
information on the investigation and prosecution of suspects 
in criminal matters received and concluded and criminal cases 
filed and terminated by U.S. attorneys. Suspects may be 
counted more than once in a fiscal year if they are involved 
in multiple matters received and concluded during the period. 
A matter is defined as a referral where an attorney spends 
one hour or more investigating. The lead charge is used to 
classify the most serious offense at referral and is defined 
as the substantive statute that is the primary basis of 
referral.
 
The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts’ (AOUSC) 
criminal master file contains information about the criminal 
proceedings against defendants whose cases were filed and 
terminated in U.S. district courts. These data include 
information on cases involving felonies, as well as Class A 
and B Misdemeanors handled by U.S. district court judges. The 
most serious filing or terminating offense is the offense 
charge that yields the greatest maximum statutory penalty. 
This report also uses AOUSC data from the Probation and 
Pretrial Services Automated Case Tracking System (PACTS), 
which contains information on defendants interviewed and 
supervised by pretrial services. These data are used to 
describe background characteristics of defendants arraigned 
and defendants detained prior to case disposition. In 
addition, post-conviction data from the AOUSC’s Federal 
Probation Supervision Information System (FPSIS) are used to 
describe immigration offenders under post-conviction 
supervision in the community. 

The Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) SENTRY database contains 
information on all sentenced offenders admitted into or 
released from federal prison during a fiscal year, and 
offenders in federal prison at the end of each fiscal year 
(September 30). The most serious commitment offense is the 
offense with the longest sentence length. All percentage 
changes referred to in this report are calculated using the 
average of the annual change between the two reported years.

Returns to federal prison 
**************************

The number of offenders returning to federal prison is a 
count of the number of federal prisoners who returned to 
federal prison after first release from a U.S. district court 
commitment. Prisoners released from federal prison for the 
first time between 1994 and 2010 were identified. The BOP’s 
SENTRY database was searched for a subsequent return to 
federal prison. Prisoners released in 2008 were the most 
recent cohort that could be tracked for 3 years following 
release through 2011. In addition, observation windows were 
included for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year return rates 
following first release. The return-to-prison rate increases 
with the length of the window used to follow-up on prisoners. 
The unit of analysis is the first release from federal 
prison, and the return rates are computed based on the number 
of first releases. 

In 2008, there were 70,327 federally sentenced prisoners 
released from the Bureau of Prisons. About 84% of prisoners 
released in 2008 (59,391) had been released following a U.S. 
district court commitment. This cohort of offenders was 
tracked for 3 years following release to count the number who 
returned to federal prison, whether for a new offense or a 
violation of supervision. A second cohort of prisoners 
released in 2006 was tracked for 5 years.

Detailed data tables are available in Federal Justice 
Statistics, 2010 –Statistical Tables (NCJ 239914). FJSP data 
are also incorporated into a BJS web query tool that permits 
users to interactively query the federal data and download 
the query results as a spreadsheet. This query tool is 
available on the BJS website. The query tool provides 
statistics by stage of the federal criminal case process, 
including law enforcement, prosecution and courts, and 
incarceration. Users can currently generate queries for up to 
three variables from 1998 to 2010. Users can also generate 
queries by title and section of the U.S. criminal code by 
processing stage from 1994 to 2010.
