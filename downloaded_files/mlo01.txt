Highlights

From 1994 to 2001 almost 18,500 defendants faced a money 
laundering-related charge filed in a U.S. district court


* Between 1994 and 2001 about 18,500 defendants were 
charged in U.S. district court with money laundering as any 
charge. Over this same 7-year period, 10,610 were charged 
with money laundering as the most serious offense filed; 
9,169 money laundering defendants were convicted.

*  Nearly half of all Federal money laundering matters were 
referred in the six geographic areas defined as High Intensity 
Financial Crimes Areas by the U.S. Departments of Treasury and 
Justice. 

*  About 60% of laundering/racketeering (Title 18) offenses 
prosecuted involved an underlying property offense (embezzlement 
or fraud); about 17% involved drug trafficking; and about 7% 
involved racketeering or violations of customs laws.

*  About 9 in 10 defendants prosecuted for money laundering 
were convicted, with 9 in 10 convictions occurring by guilty 
plea. Nearly 3 out of 4 convicted defendants received a prison
term, with the average sentence of just over 4 years.

*  In 2001 the 22 commercial defendants charged with money 
laundering included auto dealerships, grocery stores, banks, 
furniture stores, construction firms, and beauty shops.
They represented a small fraction of money laundering 
defendants.

During 2001, 1,477 defendants were charged in U.S. district 
courts with money laundering as the most serious offense filed. 
These defendants comprised 1.8% of all cases filed in U.S. 
district courts. 

Of cases concluded in 2001, 1,243 defendants were convicted of 
a money laundering offense.***Footnote 1: Money laundering is 
defined as "the process by which criminals or criminal 
organization seek to disguise the illicit nature of their 
proceeds by introducing them into the stream of legitimate 
commerce and finance."  2000-2005, Strategic Plan. U.S. 
Department of the Treasury, page 1.***  Federal defendants 
sentenced for money laundering in 2001 were convicted of 
laundering amounts ranging from less than $2,000 to more than 
$100 million.***Footnote 2: Monetary instruments include U.S.
or foreign coins and currency, travelers' checks, personal checks,
bank checks, money orders, investment securities and negotiable
instruments (18 U.S.C. sec. 1956 (c)(5)).*** About 20% of the
cases involved over $1 million.

Offenders convicted of money laundering face prison terms of 
up to 20 years, fines up to $500,000 or twice the value of the 
property involved, and possible criminal and civil forfeiture
related to the value of the property or funds involved.

Federal money laundering statutes differentiate between monetary 
record and reporting offenses requiring financial institutions 
to maintain reports and records of financial transactions 
involving more than $10,000 (originating from the 1970 Bank 
Secrecy Act)***Footnote 3: 31 U.S.C. sec sec. 5311-5332.*** and
laundering/racketeering offenses in which financial transactions 
involve the proceeds of specified unlawful activities 
(originating from the Money Laundering Control Act of 
1986).***Footnote 4: 18 U.S.C. sec sec. 1956, 1957, and 1960.***
 The monetary record and reporting statutes focus on tracking 
illicit assets via financial institution reporting requirements 
while the laundering/racketeering statutes focus on the conversion 
of illicit assets and their use to promote additional crimes.

--------------------------------------------------
Selected Federal money laundering statutes

Money laundering offenses in this report are defined according 
to Title 18 (Chapter 95, Racketeering) and Title 31 (Chapter 53, 
Monetary Transactions) of the Federal criminal code:

Title 18 statutes   
(Laundering/racketeering)
  
Laundering of monetary instruments (18 U.S.C. sec. 1956) 
involves intending to transport or transfer monetary funds
knowing that property represents the proceeds of unlawful 
activity.
  
Engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from 
specified unlawful activity (18 U.S.C. sec. 1957) involves 
knowingly engaging in a monetary transaction involving 
criminally derived property valued at more than $10,000.
  
Prohibition of unlicensed money transmitting businesses (18 
U.S.C. sec. 1960) involves failing to comply with Treasury 
regulations (that is, business registration and other required 
information) pertaining to money transmitting businesses
(that is, currency dealers and exchangers, check cashers, 
and money transmittal businesses). 

Title 31 statutes 
(Monetary record and reporting)
             
Reporting on exporting and importing monetary instruments (31 
U.S.C. sec. 5316) involves the failure to file a Report of 
International Transportation of Currency or Other Monetary 
Instruments (CMIR) when conveying such instruments of more 
than $10,000 at one time out of, into, or through the United 
States. 

Structuring transactions to evade reporting requirement (31 
U.S.C. sec. 5324) involves causing a domestic financial 
institution to fail to file a required report or to file a 
report that contains an omission or misstatement of fact, or
to structure any transaction. Structuring involves conducting 
financial transactions with the purpose of evading reporting 
requirements (that is, "breaking down a single sum of currency
exceeding $10,000 into smaller transactions to evade reporting 
requirements"). See 31 C.F.R. 103.11.
  
Failure to file a currency transaction report(CTR)on cash 
transactions involving more than $10,000 (31 U.S.C. sec. 
5313) .
-------------------------------------------------

The bulk of Federal money laundering enforcement focuses on 
the underlying criminal offenses that produce the funds to be 
laundered. Law enforcement uses a "follow-the-money" approach 
to trace illicit proceeds from such crimes as drug trafficking, 
health care fraud, and terrorism.***Footnote 5: See Lester M.
Joseph, "Money Laundering Enforcement: Following the Money,"
Economic Perspectives: An Electronic Journal of the U.S.
Department of State, 6, 2, 2001, and R.T. Naylor, Follow-the
Money Methods in Crime Control Policy, Nathanson Centre of
Organized Crime and Corruption, York University, Toronto, 1999.***
U.S. attorneys may apply the laundering/racketeering statutes 
when a financial transaction involves the proceeds and/or
concealment of the source of proceeds for any of over 250 
offenses or "specified unlawful activities" (SUA's).***Footnote 
6: See Money Laundering Statutes and Related Materials, Asset 
Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section, U.S. Department of
Justice, April 2002.***  

This report uses data from the Federal Justice Statistics 
Program (FJSP) to describe the criminal case processing of 
money laundering offenders in the Federal criminal justice 
system. Unless indicated otherwise, the designations "lead
charge"***Footnote 7: Lead Charge" is the substantive statue
that is the primary basis for investigation by U.S. attorneys
and is not necessarily the charge with the greatest potential
sentence.*** and "primary" or “most serious filing offense"
***Footnote 8: Most serious offense" is the filing offense that
yields the statutory maximum penalty.  See the methodology section
in the Corrpendium of Federal Justice Statistics, 2000 (NCJ 
194067).*** describe money laundering violators across prosecution,
adjudication, and sentencing. The exception to these designations 
occurs where money laundering is described as any offense filed 
in U.S. district court. 

During 2001 the laundering/racketeering statutes comprised the 
bulk of defendants charged with a money laundering offense as 
the most serious offense (84%). Three in five of these Title 
18 money laundering violations were associated with property-
related  SUA's such as bank embezzlement, fraud, transportation 
of stolen property, and counterfeiting (63%). Drug trafficking 
offenses were the second most common SUA's (16%), followed by 
public-order (7%) (including racketeering, witness tampering,
customs laws, and other offenses) and violent offenses 
(4%).***Footnote 9: Title 18 money laundering counts generally
involve a SUA. Information on SUA's was missing in 10% of 
cases due in part to sting cases in which an associated unlawful
activity does not apply (18 U.S.C. sec. 1956(a)(3)) and/or
instances in which information was not recorded during court
processing.*** 

In 2001 monetary record and reporting offenses made up the 
remaining 16% of defendants charged with a money laundering 
offense. Monetary record and reporting offenses do not
require a specified unlawful activity or underlying offense. 
Rather, these Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) statutes, by requiring 
records of currency transactions, provide a paper trail which 
enables enforcement agencies to uncover the illicit concealment 
of monetary instruments. In addition to financial institutions, 
BSA reporting requirements apply to securities brokers and
dealers, casinos, and money exchange businesses.***Footnote 1: 
31 C.F.R. 103.***

Referrals to U.S. attorneys for 
prosecution

During 2001, 1,437 suspects were referred to U.S. attorneys 
with money laundering as the lead charge (down 34.4% from 
2,191 referrals in 1994). These suspects comprised 1.2% of 
the total 121,818 referred. Money laundering included
1,073 defendants investigated for laundering/racketeering 
(down 33% from 1994)and 364 for record and reporting offenses 
in 2001 (down 37% from 1994).

----------------------------------------
Targeting money laundering enforcement
efforts 

High Intensity Financial Crimes Area (HIFCA) designations
were enacted as a part of the Money Laundering Strategy Act
of 1998, (P.L. 105-310) to prioritize law enforcement efforts
in areas where money laundering and related financial crimes
present a greater need. 

To date, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Attorney 
General have named six HIFCA's:
* New York/New Jersey  
* San Juan/Puerto Rico
* Los Angeles
* the southwestern border including Arizona and Texas 
* the Northern District of Illinois (Chicago) 
* the Northern District of California (San Francisco). Of 
the 1,437 matters referred to U.S. attorneys where money 
laundering was the lead charge, 625 (44%) were referred 
from judicial districts associated with an HIFCA designation. 

Related to HIFCA's are the High Intensity Drug Trafficking 
Areas (or HIDTA's). Congress established the HIDTA program 
to operate under the direction of the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy (ONDCP) by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 
(P.L.100-690) and the ONDCP Reauthorization Act of 1998. 
HIDTA's were created to counter drug trafficking in areas 
where drug enforcement needs are greatest to include the money 
laundering-drug trafficking nexus. All six HIFCA's were also 
designated as HIDTA's. 
------------------------------------------

Half the money laundering-related referrals to U.S. attorneys 
in 2001 were from 10 judicial districts. The U.S. attorney in 
the Southern District of Florida received the most referrals 
(106), followed by the Southern District of New York (83), 
Puerto Rico (78), and the Eastern District of New York (71).

Federal agency referral of matters 
evaluated for prosecution 

Multiple Federal agencies are involved in investigating money 
laundering violations and referring matters to U.S. attorneys 
for prosecution.***Footnote 11: The provisions of the Homeland
Security Act of 2002(P.L. 107-296), transferred the Treasury
Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in the
Department of Justice. Treasury's Secret Service became a part
of the Department of Homeland Security.*** In fiscal year 2001 
U.S. attorneys evaluated 1,573 suspects for prosecution for 
alleged money laundering violations, representing 1.3% of the 
118,977 Federal matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2001. 
More than 30 Federal, State, and local agencies provided 
referrals, with the majority coming from agencies of the 
Departments of Treasury or Justice.

Referrals by agencies of Treasury 

During 2001 the Treasury Department referred 896 (57%) 
suspects to U.S. attorneys in matters with money
laundering-related charges. Treasury referred more
than three-quarters of monetary record and reporting
suspects. 

From 1994 to 2001 the total of Treasury referrals
decreased 46% from 1,645. The largest part of the
decrease occurred in monetary record and reporting
violations (down 59% from 663 matters referred in
1994 to 274 in 2001). 

Of all referring agencies, the U.S. Customs Service
(USCS) had the most referrals for monetary record and
reporting offenses during 2001 (54% or 192). Money
laundering matters referred to U.S. attorneys
comprised 4.2% of all matters referred by the
USCS (not shown in table). Charged in part with
enforcing money laundering laws at U.S. borders,
the USCS accounted for the bulk of importing/
exporting monetary instrument violations (31
U.S.C. § 5316) referred for prosecution in 2001.
Of 178 matters concluded in which importing/exporting 
monetary instruments was charged, the USCS had referred 
96% (171).

The Financial Investigations Division of the USCS conducts 
undercover drug money laundering operations.  Since the 
terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the division has 
coordinated "Operation Green Quest" to "identify and
dismantle" the financial structure used to fund terrorist 
activity (U.S. Customs Service Annual Report, Fiscal Year 
2001).

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) referred 28% of suspects 
with a money laundering-related charge in matters concluded 
during 2001. IRS investigators deal with complex financial 
crimes (including money laundering and tax evasion and
asset forfeiture). Money laundering comprised 21% of all 
matters referred by the IRS in 2001 (not shown in table). 
The number of suspects whom the IRS referred for money 
laundering offenses decreased 59% from 1,077 in 1994 to
444 in 2001. Reduction in referrals was greater for 
monetary record and reporting violations (-83%) than for 
laundering/ racketeering offenses (-41%). 
--------------------------------------------

The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA) gave Treasury authority 
to require monetary record and reporting by financial 
institutions. The intent was to prevent criminals from using 
financial institutions to conceal or launder money generated 
from crime. (See 31 U.S.C. sec sec 5311-5332.) Initially 
used to deter tax evasion and money laundering by organized 
crime, the BSA statutes are applied in the investigation of 
an array of offenses ranging from drug trafficking to 
financing terrorist acts. 

BSA regulations enable the detection of criminal, tax, and 
regulatory violations by providing a paper trail that follows 
the flow of money. Financial institutions are required to 
report transactions involving --  
* currency of more than $10,000
(Currency Transaction Report) 
* transportation of more than $10,000 in currency
into or out of the United States (Currency or Other
Monetary Instruments Report)
* suspicious activity that may indicate a law has been 
broken (Suspicious Activity Report).  

The Money Laundering Control Act of 1986
criminalized money laundering, creating the first
Federal money laundering laws (18 U.S.C. sec sec 1956, 
1957). The offenses included knowingly helping to 
launder money from criminal activity, knowingly 
engaging in a monetary transaction of more than $10,000 
with property derived from criminal activity, and 
structuring transactions to avoid BSA reporting 
requirements. The act also enumerated SUA's.

The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 enhanced
reporting requirements (stricter identification and
record keeping when using cash to buy monetary
instruments) and expanded criminal and civil
penalties against money laundering. It also
provided the Treasury with authority to require
geographically targeted currency transaction
reports.

The Money Laundering Suppression Act of
1994 created more stringent requirements on the
procedures used by financial institution examiners
and expanded examiner training to improve detection 
of laundering in financial institutions. 

The Money Laundering and Financial Crimes
Strategy Act of 1998 focused on counter-money
laundering support at the State and local levels.
The act created the following: 
* The National Money Laundering Report. Treasury, together
with Justice, set forth a national plan for all levels
of government to coordinate anti-money laundering activities. 
The 2002 objectives included enhancing law enforcement of 
money laundering organizations and systems, improving
State and local law enforcement efforts, and measuring the 
effectiveness of anti-money laundering activities. 
* Designation of areas at a high risk for financial
crimes/money laundering activity (High Intensity
Financial Crime Areas)
* Financial Crime-Free Communities support programs that 
provide "seed money" of up to $300,000 to State and local 
programs to counter money laundering.

The Strengthening America Act by Providing
Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and
Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT) Act of
2001 toughened accountability of U.S. banks in
their dealings with foreign correspondent banks,
strengthened laws responding to the problem of
terrorist financing and its connection with money
laundering, and strengthened asset forfeiture laws
in matters involving funding of terrorist activities. 

In addition, the USA PATRIOT Act created a new
money laundering statute: Bulk cash smuggling
(18 U.S.C. sec 5332). The new statute prohibits
the concealment and transfer of more than
$10,000 across the border with the intent to
evade reporting requirements. Convicted defendants are 
subject to a greater sentence than a reporting violation 
(that is, 18 U.S.C. sec 5316)and all property involved 
in bulk cash smuggling is subject to criminal and/or 
civil forfeiture.
----------------------------------------------

The Secret Service investigates financial fraud schemes 
and currency counterfeiting. During 2001 the Secret Service 
referred 8 money laundering matters, down from 19 in 2000. 
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms referred 26 
money laundering matters to U.S. attorneys during 2001.

Referrals by Justice agencies

During 2001 law enforcement agencies of the Department of 
Justice referred 614 (39%) money laundering suspects to 
U.S attorneys, the bulk of which were for laundering/
racketeering offenses with specified unlawful activities 
(91%). The number of Justice referrals with a laundering/
racketeering violation peaked in 1995 with 725 referrals 
and decreased in 1998 (425)before increasing to 650 during 
2001. 

The FBI was the source of the largest number of Title 18 
referrals (31%). The FBI has primary or dual jurisdiction 
over most of the specified unlawful activities listed under 
the money laundering statutes. The FBI's Money Laundering 
Unit uncovers money laundering schemes which are a part of 
drug trafficking, organized crime, violent crime, and white 
collar crime. 

------------------------------------------
Reporting of suspicious activity 

From 1997 to 2001 the number of Suspicious
Activity Reports submitted increased 206%.
States with the highest suspicious activity
reporting rates per 100,000 persons in the
general population were New York, Nevada, and
California (derived from FinCEN, SAR Activity
Report, 2002).

The New York metropolitan area had  more than
an estimated 14,000 Suspicious Activity Reports
filed in fiscal years 1998 and 1999, with a
reported aggregate amount of over $33 billion
(National Drug Intelligence Center, 2001). In the
same period, Los Angeles had the second highest
number, 5,171, with an aggregated value of more
than $7 billion.
-------------------------------------------

Of the 30,708 total matters referred by the FBI for
prosecution during 2001, 1.4% had money laundering 
as the lead charge.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) often
works in conjunction with other agencies in
investigating money laundering as it pertains to
drug offending. During 2001 the DEA referred to
U.S. attorneys 139 matters with money laundering
as the lead charge. These comprised about 1% of
the 16,844 DEA referrals.

Referrals by other agencies 

As a money service business, though a non-banking 
institution, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is required 
to comply with the Bank Secrecy Act reporting requirements. 
The USPS also investigates the illicit use of postal 
financial products to include money laundering. The USPS
referred 25 money laundering matters to U.S. attorneys for 
prosecution (less than 1% the 4,010 referrals for all matters 
referred by the USPS). 

Matters prosecuted

Of money laundering matters concluded during 2001,
54% were declined for further prosecution. Forty
percent of laundering/racketeering matters were
prosecuted in U.S. district court, and 64% of monetary
record and reporting violations were prosecuted.
(Exporting/importing monetary instruments had the
highest prosecution rate of the component offenses that
comprise money laundering: 87%.) From 1994 to 2001 the 
prosecution rate for monetary record and reporting offenses 
increased from 38% to 64% while the prosecution rate for
laundering/racketeering declined slightly (from 46% in 1994 
to 40% in 2001).

* Of the 855 declinations for prosecution, 13% were 
prosecuted by other authorities or prosecuted on other 
charges (not shown in table).

* 23% of matters were declined for lack of criminal 
intent, 19% due to insufficient or weak evidence, and 
17% at the request of the referring agency (not shown 
in table). 

Cases filed in U.S. district court

During 2001, 1,477 defendants were charged with money 
laundering. Laundering/racketeering offenses comprised 
84% (laundering of monetary instruments, 74.5% and 
engaging in monetary transactions using property derived 
from specified unlawful activity, 9.5%), and monetary 
record and reporting 16% of cases (exporting/importing
monetary instruments, 9%, structuring financial
transactions, 6%).

The principal money laundering statutes (18 U.S.C. sec. 
1956 and 1957) apply in cases where transactions involved 
proceeds from a broad range of specified unlawful activities. 
During 2001, 1,100 defendants were charged with laundering 
of monetary instruments.

Of these defendants, 63% were also charged with a property 
offense (for example, bank fraud, embezzlement, and 
counterfeiting); 16%, with a drug offense (for example, 
importing/exporting controlled substance and selling or 
distributing marijuana). Public-order offenses (for example,
racketeering, bribery, and extortion) comprised
7% and violent offenses (includes kidnaping and
bank robbery) 2% of cases in which money
laundering was the most serious offense filed.
Specified unlawful activities information was not
indicated in 12% of cases. 

Of the 140 defendants charged with engaging in
monetary transactions using property derived
from specified unlawful activity, the most common
SUA’s included bank robbery and kidnaping
(30%) followed by public-order (29%) and
property offenses (28%).

Adjudication of money laundering defendants 
in U.S. district court

About 88% of 1,420 adjudicated defendants were convicted. 
Of the 1,243 convicted defendants, 91% had pleaded guilty, 
and 9% were found guilty at trial.

Of the 177 cases that did not result in a conviction,
most (82%) were dismissed. Ninety-four percent of
defendants adjudicated for exporting/importing
monetary instruments were convicted, and of those
convicted, 98% had pleaded guilty. Monetary reporting
and recording offenses had a slightly higher conviction
rate (92%) compared to laundering/racketeering
offenses (87%). 

-------------------------------------------
Money laundering as a secondary offense

In addition to the 1,477 defendants charged with
money laundering as the primary charge during 2001,
money laundering was a secondary offense in 630
cases. Of these 630 cases, the most serious offense
charged was drug-related (90%), followed by property
(6%), public-order (4%), and violent offenses (1%).
  
Between 1994 and 2001 the number of defendants with any 
money laundering-related charges filed in U.S. district 
court reached a peak in 1998 at 2,712 cases (an increase 
of 42.5% from 1994), followed by a decrease to 2,107
cases in 2001 (but an overall increase of 10.7% in
number of cases from 1994). The number of defendants with 
money laundering as a secondary charge increased 11%, and 
the number of defendants with money laundering as the most 
serious offense increased 10%.

Ninety-two percent of the 623 defendants adjudicated for 
money laundering as a secondary offense during 2001 were 
convicted. Of those convicted, 6% of convictions were 
obtained via trial verdicts. Drug trafficking had the 
highest rate of conviction (92%).

About 90% of defendants convicted of money laundering as 
a secondary offense received a prison sentence. Rates of 
imprisonment varied across the types of offenses (drug 
offenses, 90%; property offenses, 73%; and public-order 
offenses, 72%). Defendants with a drug offense as the most 
serious offense received prison terms with an average 97
months, compared to 44 months for property offenders.
Prison terms for public-order offenses (including
racketeering/extortion) had an average of 70 months.
---------------------------------------------

Case processing time

During 2001, the average processing time from filing
to disposition was 17 months for money laundering
defendants. Of money laundering cases adjudicated,
trials took an average of 22 months (from case filing to
disposition), compared to an average of 15 months for
cases which were the result of a guilty plea (of the
1,420 criminal cases terminating in U.S. district courts
in 2001). Laundering/racketeering offenses were
processed on average within 18 months, 7 months
longer than monetary records and report violations.

Characteristics of defendants convicted of
money laundering

Defendants sentenced for money laundering as the most 
serious filing offense were primarily male (80%), U.S. 
citizens (77%), over age 35 (70%), and white (52%). One 
in three defendants convicted of money laundering had a 
prior adult conviction.  Defendants with a monetary record 
and reporting filing offense were less apt to be U.S. 
citizens (52%) and comparatively less likely to have a 
prior criminal history (21%) than laundering/racketeering
defendants. A greater share of defendants with a monetary 
record and reporting offense were female (29%) and Hispanic 
(48%) than defendants convicted of laundering/racketeering 
offenses.

Sentencing outcomes

During 2001, of the 1,243 defendants convicted for money 
laundering, 72% received a sentence to a prison term, and 
24% received probation only. Defendants convicted of 
laundering/racketeering (79%) were more likely than defendants 
convicted of monetary record and reporting violations (40%) to 
receive a term of imprisonment. Eighty percent of defendants 
convicted of laundering of monetary instruments or of engaging 
in transactions from unlawful activity received a sentence to 
prison. Imprisonment was less likely for defendants 
convicted of exporting/ importing monetary instruments 
(41%)and structuring illegal financial transactions 
(38%).

The average prison sentence imposed for defendants 
convicted of money laundering was 48 months. The 712 
defendants that received a prison sentence for laundering 
of monetary instruments received a longer prison term, on
average, than for other money laundering offenses (53 
months). More than half of defendants convicted of 
structuring financial transactions received probation 
only as a sentence.

Probation terms imposed were greatest, on average, for 
laundering of monetary instruments (44 months) and least, 
for structuring financial transactions (31 months). A 
total of 256 defendants with money laundering as the most 
serious offense of conviction received an average fine of 
$40,808. The median fine amount was $2,750.

-------------------------------------------
State activities against money laundering

In 1985 Arizona became the first State to adopt
legislation against money laundering. Since then, 
35 other States have adopted similar legislation.

States follow four models to some degree:  
* the Federal statute (31 USC sec sec 1956-1957)
(used notably by New York)  
* the President's Commission on Model State
Drug Laws (1993), including money laundering,
money transmitting, asset forfeiture, and related
provisions 
* the Money Transmitter Regulators Association, 
a State regulator group and publisher of a model 
statute
* the National Conference of Commissioners on
Uniform State Laws, model statutes.
 
State legislation varies widely, covering a 
spectrum from specified unlawful activities, such
as racketeering or corrupt activities and crime
for profit, to any felony. The basis of culpability
across States with statutes is a transaction
involving the proceeds of a statutorily defined
unlawful activity. 

Transactions involving criminal proceeds with
the intent to conceal the source of the proceeds
are frequently coupled with the requirement that
the actor know that the proceeds were derived
from specified unlawful activity. In some States
the transaction has to have taken place in a
bank; in others, any transaction qualifies. 
Transportation is included in some State
statutes to criminalize the movement of
proceeds without an intervening transaction. 

Following the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act, 10 
States (Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, 
Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, and New York) 
adopted new or amended legislation to regulate the money
transmitter industry. In fiscal years 2000 and 2001, 17 
sites were awarded Financial Crime-Free Community grants 
from a total of $2.9 million allocated. This money is 
used to enhance intrastate efforts against money 
laundering -- to include developing capabilities
to detect and prosecute money laundering.
-----------------------------------------------

Defendants convicted of money laundering are also subject 
to criminal forfeiture (18 U.S.C. sec. 982). During 2001, 
85 defendants convicted of a money laundering offense 
were also charged under the criminal forfeiture statute. 
All property may be forfeitable, even legitimate funds 
that were commingled with illicit assets. 

All property associated with the money laundering
offense is also subject to civil forfeiture. Civil 
(and criminal) forfeiture penalties can be assessed for
monetary record and reporting violations (for conduct 
violating 31 U.S.C. sec sec 5313, 5316, or 5324)
***Footnote 12: 31 U.S.C. sec. 5317*** and in violation 
of laundering/racketeering statutes (18 U.S.C. sec sec. 
1956, 1957, or 1960).***Footnote 13: 18 U.S.C. sec. 981
(a)(1)(A).***

Defendants sentenced under the U.S.
Sentencing Commission's Money Laundering
Guidelines

During 2001, 951 defendants were sentenced for money 
laundering under the three money laundering sentencing 
guidelines.***Footnote 14: The primary guideline at
sentencing is used for reporting money laundering
defendants sentenced.  The Sentencing Guidelines were
amended on November 1, 2001, effectively consolidating
sections 2S1.1 (laundering of monetary instruments) and
2S1.2 (engaging in monetary transactions in property
derived from unlawful activity) and more closely tying
money laundering violations to the underlying offense.***

---------------------------------------------
Commercial defendants and money laundering
Businesses comprised less than 2% of all money laundering-
related defendants adjudicated during 2001. The 22 businesses
charged with money laundering as the most serious offense 
included auto dealerships, grocery stores, banks, furniture 
stores, restaurants, physicians' offices, construction firms, 
beauty shops, and research firms.

Of the 22 charged, 15 were convicted (68.2%); 13 received 
probation (with an average term of 38.8 months), and 8 were 
fined (an average of $68,454). 
-----------------------------------------------

Sixty-five percent of defendants were sentenced for 
laundering of monetary instruments. Thirteen percent were 
sentenced for engaging in monetary transactions using 
property derived from unlawful activities, and 22% were 
sentenced for exporting/importing monetary instruments,
structuring transactions to evade reporting requirements, 
or failing to file a currency transaction report.

The guidelines permit a longer sentence if a defendant 
organized, managed, or led the money laundering. Of 
defendants sentenced under the money laundering guidelines, 
84% received no upward adjustment; 5% received a sentence
adjustment for playing a role as manager, organizer, 
supervisor or leader; 4%, an adjustment for managing five 
or more participants (not specifically organizing or leading); 
and 7%, an adjustment for leading or organizing five or
more people. 

Of the 951 defendants sentenced under the money laundering 
guidelines, 51% were convicted for laundering less than 
$200,000, 44% were convicted of laundering between $200,000
and $10 million, and 4% had laundered more than $10 million 
(not shown in table). 

Methodology

The source of the data used in this report is the BJS Federal 
Justice Statistics Program (FJSP) database.  The FJSP compiles 
comprehensive information on individuals and corporations
processed through the Federal justice system from source files 
provided by the Executive Office of United States Attorneys 
(EOUSA), the Administrative Office of the United States Courts
(AOUSC), the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS), the Drug Enforcement 
Administration (DEA), the United States Sentencing Commission 
(USSC), and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). 

In this report, money laundering offenders were defined 
according to selected Federal criminal statutes. (See page 2.) 
For suspects in matters referred and concluded, the "lead 
charge" was used to describe money laundering suspects.
This pool includes criminal referrals for which the
assistant U.S. attorneys indicated a money laundering 
statute as the “lead charge” or primary basis for 
investigation and for which at least 1 hour of investigation 
time was spent. The AOUSC provided U.S. district court data 
on money laundering defendants in criminal cases filed, 
adjudicated, and sentenced. The "most serious offense" is 
the filing offense with the statutory maximum penalty. Money 
laundering violations from all offenses filed for a particular
defendant were also reported. Specified Unlawful Activities 
(SUA's) were aggregated to BJS offense categories as shown 
in Appendix table 1 and reported in table 2.  

Data from the USSC showing defendants with money laundering 
as the primary sentencing guideline overlaps with, but does 
not represent the same pool of defendants described in the 
AO data. Both datasets include defendants for whom the 
offense of money laundering resulted in the longest sentence 
though differences arise as defendants could be sentenced 
under more than one guideline. Checks were made on the two 
data series for 2001, and money laundering defendants were 
found to share a comparable profile.

Survey of State and Federal inmates

Of the more than 55,000 drug offenders in
Federal prison during 1997, 4% indicated they
had been laundering drug money at the time of
arrest, compared to 3% of the 217,000 drug
offenders in State prison. 

Of State and Federal inmates serving time for a
drug offense, about half (144,364) indicated that
at the time of their arrest they were either 
selling to users or distributing drugs to dealers.

About 11% of State and Federal inmates who
reported having sold drugs at the time of arrest
indicated that they had been involved in running
drug money. (Thirteen percent of drug traffickers
in Federal prisons and 11% of State traffickers
reported having engaged in running drug money.)
