Seasonal Patterns in Criminal Victimization Trends

Janet L. Lauritsen, Ph.D., BJS Visiting Fellow, 
and Nicole White, Ph.D., University of Missouri – St. Louis

**************
Introduction
**************

Seasonal patterns exist when similar fluctuations in the
victimization rates tend to recur each year during the same
season. Seasonal patterns are a long-standing topic in both
popular and scholarly literatures on crime and show how
environmental factors, such as temperature changes and
daylight hours, might be associated with crime throughout
the year. Seasonal patterns also are examined to learn
whether routine activity patterns, such as those associated
with the beginning and end of the school year, are 
associated with variations in crime throughout the year.

This report examines seasonal patterns in violent and
household property victimization in the United States from
1993 to 2010. It describes seasonal patterns for household
property victimization (burglary, motor vehicle theft, and
household larceny) and types of violence (rape and sexual
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault).
Trends in other forms of violence, including intimate 
partner violence, victimizations involving weapons, and 
those resulting in injury, also are examined to determine 
the extent to which seasonal fluctuations exist.

For household property crimes, the victimization data
indicate that there are seasonal patterns in household
burglary and larceny, with higher rates in the summer and
lower rates during other seasons of the year. Motor vehicle
thefts do not exhibit the same seasonal patterns.

For violent victimizations, seasonal patterns also vary
depending on the type of crime. Rape and sexual assault
rates and aggravated assault rates are higher in the summer
than in most other seasons. In comparison, simple assault
rates are higher in the fall than in other seasons, and 
robbery victimization rates show no seasonal patterns. 
Intimate partner violence exhibits regular seasonal 
fluctuations with rates highest during the summer and lowest 
during the winter. Rates of violence involving weapons and 
violence resulting in serious injury are higher in the summer 
than in the winter and spring seasons; however, the fall 
rates are not significantly different from the summer rates.

*************
Highlights
*************

* When seasonal variations in household property
victimization were found, the differences between the
highest and lowest seasonal rates were less than 11%.

* Seasonal patterns existed in household larceny and 
burglary victimization rates. Rates of these household 
crimes tended to be higher in the summer than during other 
seasons of the year.

* Though rates of motor vehicle theft tended to be lower
in the spring than in the summer, there were few regular
differences between summer, fall, and winter rates.

*  When seasonal variations were found for violent
victimization, the differences between the rates of the
highest and lowest season were less than 12%.

* Aggravated assault rates were higher during the summer
than during the winter, spring, and fall. In comparison,
simple assault rates were higher during the fall than during
other seasons of the year.

* Robbery rates did not exhibit seasonal variations.

* Rape and sexual assault victimization rates tended to be
higher during the summer than during the fall and winter.

* Rates of intimate partner violence were higher during the
summer than during the winter, spring, and fall.
**************************************************

The data in this report were developed from the Bureau
of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS), which annually collects information on
nonfatal victimizations against persons age 12 or older
from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.
The data included crimes reported and not reported to the
police from 1993 to 2010. Asking the victim in which month
the incident occurred makes it possible to assess how the
risk for victimization varies throughout the year. For each
of the crime types, differences in the rates are compared
across the four seasons of the year. Winter rates are based
on victimizations that occur in December, January, and
February; spring rates occur in March, April, and May;
summer rates occur in June, July, and August; and fall rates
occur in September, October, and November. Seasonal
patterns in the 1993 to 2010 trends exist when statistical
analyses reveal periodic fluctuations in the rates, which 
tend to recur each year during the same season See Methodology
for a description of the statistical analysis used in this 
report.

Prior BJS Research on Seasonality
**********************************

BJS has previously examined seasonal patterns in
selected types of victimization using monthly data from
1973 to 1977 from the National Crime Survey (NCS), the
predecessor of the National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS). ***Footnote 1Crime and Seasonality: National Crime 
Survey Report, NCJ 64818, BJS web, May 1980.***
Earlier research examined some of the same types of 
victimizations assessed in this report.

The previous report found notable seasonal fluctuations
in household larceny and burglary, and rates were
highest during the summer months. Seasonal differences
were also found for motor vehicle theft and for assault
victimization. For these crimes, the differences between
the summer and winter month rates were relatively
smaller than those found for household burglary and
larceny. The earlier findings for these types of 
victimization are similar to the patterns shown in this 
report; however, the magnitude of the seasonal differences 
were somewhat larger from 1973 to 1977 than from 1993 to 
2010. During the earlier period, burglaries were about 26% 
less frequent in the winter than in the summer, while in the 
more recent period, the winter versus summer difference in 
burglary was about 11%. No significant seasonal fluctuations 
were found for robbery in either study.

Seasonal patterns in household 
property victimization
********************************

Total household property victimization
***************************************

Rates of total household property victimization include
burglary, motor vehicle theft, and household larceny.
Differences in the total household property victimization
rates across winter, spring, summer, and fall exhibited
recurrent seasonal patterns (figure 1). In all of the years
except 1995, rates of household property victimization
appeared highest in summer and lowest in either winter or
spring. Statistical analysis of the seasonal rates indicates 
that they were higher in the summer than in the other 
seasons of the year (table 1). Compared to summer rates, 
household property victimization rates were an average of 
about 7% lower in winter, 8% lower in spring, and 3% lower 
in fall. Therefore, the difference between rates in the 
summer and other seasons was relatively small.

Burglary
************

Household burglary exhibited seasonal patterns, with rates
of victimization typically highest in summer and lowest in
winter or spring (figure 2). In all but 3 years (1999, 2005,
and 2008), rates of burglary appeared ***Footnote 2 The term 
"appeared" refers to within year seasonal variations in 
point estimates that are not statistically different.*** 
highest in summer. 

In some years, spring rates of burglary were lower than
winter rates. On average, household burglary rates were
approximately 11% lower in winter, 9% lower in spring, and
about 6% lower in fall than in summer. Among household
property crimes, burglary showed the largest average
difference (11%) between the peak (summer) and trough
(winter) seasonal rates.

Motor vehicle theft
*********************

Compared to other household property crimes, rates of
motor vehicle theft showed limited amounts of seasonal
variation from 1993 to 2010 (figure 3). In approximately
half of the years, motor vehicle theft appeared highest in 
the summer, while in other years it appeared higher during 
the fall. The lowest rates of motor vehicle theft seemed to 
be in the spring, though this was not always the case. 
Statistical analysis confirmed the lack of seasonality in 
motor vehicle theft and revealed that the differences 
between summer, fall, and winter rates were not 
statistically significant. However, spring rates were 
significantly lower than summer rates of motor vehicle 
theft, with spring rates on average about 6% lower than 
summer rates.

Household larceny
******************

Rates of household larceny showed some consistent seasonal
fluctuations throughout the 1993 to 2010 period (figure 4).
Household larceny typically appeared highest in the summer, 
though in some years (such as 1994 to 1996), fall rates 
appeared equal to or slightly higher than the summer rates. 
Like burglary, household larceny rates also appeared to be 
lowest in the spring or winter. Statistical analyses  
revealed seasonality in household larceny. Compared to 
summer rates, household larceny rates were about 6% lower in 
the winter, 8% lower in spring, and about 3% lower in fall.

******************************
Seasonal patterns in violent
Victimization
******************************

Total violent victimization
****************************

Summary indicators and specific types of violence were
examined to assess the seasonal patterns for violent
victimization. Total violent victimization includes rape
and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple
assault. Differences in the total violent victimization 
rates across the winter, spring, summer, and fall exhibited 
some recurrent seasonal patterns from 1993 to 2010 (figure 
5). However, these patterns were different from those 
observed for household property victimization.

In most years, rates of violence appeared highest in the
fall and lowest in the winter, though this was not always
the case. On average, statistical analysis indicated that 
the rates were higher in the fall than in the winter and 
spring and that summer rates were statistically similar to 
rates of violence during the fall (table 2). Though the 
differences between the fall rates of violence and the 
winter and spring rates were statistically significant, the 
seasonal variations were small. On average, rates of 
violence during the fall were about 4% higher than winter 
rates and about 3% higher than spring rates.

Serious violent victimization
******************************

Serious violent victimization rates, which include rape
and sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault, varied
significantly across the seasons in ways that differed from
those for total violent victimization (figure 6). 
Statistical analysis of seasonal rates showed that serious 
violence was significantly higher during the summer than 
during the winter, spring, and fall seasons. Winter rates of 
serious violence were approximately 6% lower on average than
summer rates of serious violence, and rates for spring
(5% lower) and fall (3% lower) were also lower than summer
rates. Because serious violent victimization excluded simple
assault, the differences between the seasonal patterns for
total and serious violent victimization indicate a unique
seasonal pattern for simple assault victimization compared
to other types of violence.

Rape and sexual assault
************************

When trends in specific types of violent crime were
examined separately, differences in seasonal patterns
emerged. Rape and sexual assault rates exhibited some
regular fluctuation across some of the seasons; however,
the patterns did not indicate a single peak season, as the
differences between the summer and spring rates were not
statistically significant (figure 7). Winter and fall rates 
of rape and sexual assault tended to be lower than summer
rates, but they were not significantly lower than spring 
rates. From 1993 to 2010, winter rates of rape and sexual 
assault were approximately 9% lower on average than summer 
rates, and fall rates were about 10% lower than summer 
rates.

Robbery
********

Unlike the other types of violent crime, robbery did not
exhibit seasonal fluctuations from year to year (figure 8).
Robbery victimization rates were statistically similar 
during winter, spring, summer, and fall. This similarity in 
seasonal rates indicates that the periodic fluctuations that 
were observed in the rates did not usually recur each year 
during the same season.

Aggravated assault
********************

Seasonal patterns in aggravated assault were statistically
significant and most comparable to those shown for serious
violent victimization (figure 9). This was because 
aggravated assault rates were higher than the rates for the 
other serious violence crime types (rape and sexual assault 
and robbery). In over half of the years, aggravated assault 
appeared to peak in the summer. Likewise, the seasonality 
analysis indicated that aggravated assault rates were 
significantly higher during the summer than during the 
winter, spring, and fall seasons. More specifically, winter 
rates of aggravated assault were about 7% lower on average 
than summer rates, and rates for spring (6% lower) and fall 
(4% lower) were also lower than summer rates.

Simple assault
***************

As suggested by the differences in the seasonal patterns
for total violence and serious violent victimization, simple
assault rates exhibited a unique pattern of seasonality
(figure 10). Unlike any other type of violent victimization,
simple assault rates were highest in the fall. On average,
winter rates of simple assault were nearly 6% lower than
fall rates, while spring and summer rates were about 5%
lower than fall rates. This unique seasonal pattern for 
simple assault was due to the experiences of youth ages 12 
to 17 whose victimization experiences exhibited distinct 
seasonal patterns compared to adults (see textbox on page 
13).

************************************
Seasonal patterns in simple assault 
differed for youth and adults
************************************

Simple assault victimization rates were higher among youth 
ages 12 to 17 than among adults age 18 and older and 
exhibited different peak and trough seasons (figure 11). 
Simple assault rates among youth were lowest during the 
summer when the school year ended, and highest in the fall 
when the school year began. Adult rates of simple assault 
exhibited relatively less seasonal fluctuation and were 
highest in the summer.

Intimate partner violence
**************************

To assess the degree of regular seasonal fluctuations in
intimate partner violence, rates of all types of violent
victimization in which the victim reported that the offender
was a current or ex-spouse, or a current or ex-boyfriend
or girlfriend, were examined. Seasonal rates of intimate
partner violence appeared to peak in the summer in more
than half of the years (figure 12). Statistical analysis of 
the intimate partner violence rates indicated that there 
were seasonal differences between summer rates and the rates
for other seasons (table 3). Compared to the summer,
intimate partner violence was about 12% lower in the winter,
6% lower in the spring, and 9% lower in the fall (table 3).

Serious violence involving weapons
***********************************

Rates of serious violence involving weapons also exhibited
some statistically significant patterns of seasonal 
variation (figure 13). Violence involving weapon use tended 
to be higher during the summer than during the winter and
spring. On average, winter rates of this type of violence
were approximately 6% lower than summer rates, while
spring rates were about 5% lower than summer rates. The
differences between the summer and fall rates were not large
enough across the years to be statistically significant.

Serious violence resulting in injury
**************************************

Seasonal patterns in rates of serious violent victimization
resulting in injury were comparable to those found for
serious violence involving weapons (figure 14). Violent
victimizations resulting in serious injury tended to occur 
at higher rates during the summer than during the winter and
spring. Winter and spring rates of serious violence 
resulting in injury were about 7% lower than summer rates. 
Although fall rates were also somewhat lower on average than 
summer rates, these differences were not statistically 
significant.

Summary
********

With the exception of robbery, each of the violent and
household property crimes exhibited a pattern of recurrent
seasonal fluctuations in their trends from 1993 to 2010.
The most common pattern for household property crimes
was that victimization occurred at higher rates during
the summer than during other seasons. Motor vehicle
theft rates exhibited less regular seasonal fluctuation than
household burglary and larceny. While summer rates of
motor vehicle theft were higher than spring rates, they
were not significantly different from winter and fall rates.
Across each type of household property victimization, the
fluctuations between the seasonal peak and trough rates are
less than 11%. In comparison, the variations in the annual
victimization rates from 1993 to 2010 were much larger.
For example, the household property victimization rate
declined 62% from 318.9 per 1,000 households in 1993 to
120.2 per 1,000 households in 2010.***Footnote 3 Criminal 
Victimization, 2010, NCJ 235508, BJS web, September 2011.***  
Therefore, the variation in household victimization rates 
across the years was larger than the seasonal fluctuations 
within the calendar year. For violent crimes, the most 
common pattern showed that victimization rates were higher 
during the summer than during other seasons of the year. 
However, this pattern had two important exceptions. First, 
unlike any other type of violence, robbery rates exhibited 
no seasonal variation over time. Second, simple assault 
rates were higher in the fall than in the winter, spring, 
and summer. These findings indicating little seasonality in 
robbery and peak rates of simple assault in the fall were 
similar to those found in prior BJS research based on 
victimization data from the mid-1970s.***Footnote 4
Crime and Seasonality: National Crime Survey Report, NCJ 
64818, BJS web, May 1980. ***

Intimate partner violence rates were higher during the
summer than during other seasons of the year. This pattern
was more similar to the seasonal variations found for 
serious violence than for simple assault victimization. 
Trends in assault resulting in serious injury and assault 
involving weapons also indicated that summer rates were 
higher than the rates in other seasons; however, the 
differences between fall and summer rates in these types of 
violence were not statistically significant. When seasonal 
differences in various types of violence were found, the 
magnitude of the difference between the peak and trough 
rates was 12% or less. Like household property crime, 
variations in the annual violent victimization rates from 
1993 to 2010 were larger. The violent victimization rate 
declined 70% from 49.9 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older in 
1993 to 14.9 per 1,000 in 2010, varying more from 1993 to 
2010 than across the seasons of the year.***Footnote 5

Methodology
************

Survey coverage
*****************

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an
annual data collection conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau
for the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The NCVS is a
self-report survey in which interviewed persons are asked
about the number and characteristics of victimizations they
they experienced during the prior 6 months. The NCVS
collects information on nonfatal personal crimes (rape or
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and
personal larceny) and household property crimes (burglary,
motor vehicle theft, and other theft) both reported and not
reported to police. In addition to providing annual-level 
and change estimates on criminal victimization, the NCVS is
the primary source of information on the nature of criminal
victimization incidents. Survey respondents provide
information about themselves (such as age, sex, race and
ethnicity, marital status, education level, and income) and
whether they experienced a victimization. The survey also
collects information about the offender in each 
victimization incident (such as age, race and ethnicity, 
sex, and victim–offender relationship), characteristics of 
the crime (including time and place, use of weapons, nature 
of injury, and economic consequences), whether the crime was 
reported to police, reasons why the crime was or was not 
reported, and experiences with the criminal justice system.

The NCVS is administered to persons age 12 or older from
a nationally representative sample of households in the
United States. The NCVS defines a household as a group of
members who all reside at a sampled address. Persons are
considered household members when the sampled address is
their usual place of residence at the time of the interview 
and when they have no usual place of residence elsewhere. 
Once selected, households remain in the sample for 3 years, 
and eligible persons in these households are interviewed 
every 6 months for a total of seven interviews. New 
households rotate into the sample on an ongoing basis to 
replace outgoing households that have been in the sample for 
the 3-year period. The sample includes persons living in 
group quarters, such as dormitories, rooming houses, and 
religious group dwellings, and excludes persons living in 
military barracks and institutional settings, such as 
correctional or hospital facilities, and homeless shelters. 
(For more detail, see Survey Methodology in Criminal 
Victimization in the United States, 2008, NCJ 231173, BJS 
web, May 2011.)

Nonresponse and weighting adjustments
***************************************

In 2010, about 41,000 households and 73,300 individuals age
12 or older were interviewed for the NCVS. Each household
was interviewed twice during the year. The response rate
was 92.3% of households and 87.5% of eligible individuals.
Victimizations that occurred outside of the U.S. were
excluded from this report.

Estimates in this report use data from the 1993 to 2010
NCVS data files. These files can be weighted to produce
annual estimates of victimization for persons age 12 or 
older living in U.S. households. Because the NCVS relies on 
a sample rather than a census of the entire U.S. population,
weights are designed to inflate sample point estimates to
known population totals and to compensate for survey
nonresponse and other aspects of the sample design.

The NCVS data files include both person and household
weights. Person weights provide an estimate of the
population represented by each person in the sample.
Household weights provide an estimate of the U.S.
household population represented by each household in the
sample. After proper adjustment, both household and person
weights are also typically used to form the denominator in
calculations of crime rates.

Victimization weights used in this analysis account for
the number of persons present during an incident. High 
frequency repeat victimizations (or series victimizations) 
are handled differently in this report than in recent BJS
victimization reports because they present a special problem
for seasonality analysis. Series victimizations are similar 
in type but occur with such frequency that a victim is 
unable to recall each individual event or describe each 
event in detail. Survey procedures allow NCVS interviewers 
to identify and classify these similar victimizations as 
series victimizations and to collect detailed information on 
only the most recent incident in the series. Because the 
month in which a victimization occurred is recorded only for 
the most recent incident, series victimizations are treated 
as a single victimization. The percentage of victimizations
reported as series victimizations declined from 1993 to
2010. In 2010, series incidents accounted for about 1%
of household property victimizations and about 3% of
violent victimizations.

Methodological changes 
to the NCVS in 2006
************************

Methodological changes implemented in 2006 may have
affected the crime estimates for that year to such an extent
that they are not comparable to estimates from other years.
Evaluation of 2007 and later data from the NCVS conducted
by BJS and the Census Bureau found a high degree of
confidence that estimates for 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 are
consistent with and comparable to estimates for 2005 and
previous years. The reports, Criminal Victimization, 2006,
NCJ 219413, December 2007; Criminal Victimization, 2007,
NCJ 224390, December 2008; Criminal Victimization, 2008,

NCJ 231327, October 2010; and Criminal Victimization,
2010, NCJ 235508, September 2011, are available on the
BJS website.

Estimating and analyzing seasonal 
victimization rates
**********************************

Victims’ reports of the month in which the incident
occurred are used to estimate seasonal rates of 
victimization. Seasons of the year are defined according to 
the month in which the season begins. Therefore, winter 
rates include in December, January, and February incidents; 
spring rates include March, April, and May incidents; summer 
rates include June, July, and August incidents; and fall 
rates include September, October, and November incidents. 
The 1993 to 2010 seasonal victimization rates include 
incidents occurring from December 1992 through November 
2010. Seasonal household property victimization rates are
estimated by dividing the weighted number of incidents
by the weighted number of households and multiplying by
1,000. Violent victimization rates are estimated by dividing
the weighted number of incidents by the weighted number
of persons age 12 and older and multiplying by 1,000.
Sampling weights are used in all population estimates.

The NCVS has three important design features that
reduce potential errors in measuring the month in which
victimization occurred. First, the relatively short 6-month
reference period reduces the chances that victims will 
forget the incident, underreport victimizations, and 
attribute incidents to the wrong month. Second, the bounding
procedure provides a reference point for respondents
about previously reported incidents, and thereby reduces
telescoping and minimizes error in assigning dates to
incidents. Third, the rotating panel structure of the survey
is designed so that data are collected from respondents in
each month of the year. This minimizes recency bias errors
in reporting the dates of incidents, which may occur if the
survey was administered only once during a fixed period
each year.

The extent and statistical significance of seasonal patterns 
in household property victimization and violent 
victimization are estimated by developing regression models 
that decompose each of the victimization trends into three
components: the long-term trend, seasonal variation
around that trend, and error. To ensure that the results are
robust, two regression-based approaches were used along
with various sensitivity tests. For each analysis, variables
representing the seasons of the year were regressed on each
victimization trend to estimate the difference between the
peak seasonal rate and the rates in the other seasons.

The first approach estimated ordinary least squares
regression models for each victimization series and included
year fixed effects to account for the long-term trend.
The degree of autocorrelation in the error structure was
estimated using Breusch-Godfrey tests for up to four lagged
periods. For victimization series in which autocorrelated
error was present, a lagged indicator was found to remove
the autocorrelation. In a few instances, autocorrelated 
errors persisted despite a variety of lag specifications; 
therefore, Newey-West standard errors were estimated to take 
into account the potential influences of autocorrelation and
heteroskedasticity in the error structure.

The second approach re-estimated the regression models
for each victimization series using first differences in 
rates to examine whether the seasonality results were 
replicated when the models accounted for possible stochastic
nonstationarity in the trends. Autocorrelated errors were
similarly assessed and handled in the first-difference 
models and the conclusions about the statistical 
significance of each of the seasonal coefficients were 
replicated in these results. Stationarity in the 
victimization trends in levels and first differences was 
examined using Dickey-Fuller and Philips-Perron tests. 

Additional diagnostic tests were performed to ensure
that the models, and therefore estimates of the seasonal
differences, fit the observed seasonal rates. These included
visual inspections of observed and predicted trends and
model-fit improvement F-tests that compared the results
based on long-term trends to those based on long-term
trends plus seasonal variations. Further details about this
statistical process using the burglary trend as an 
illustration are shown in appendix table 4.

The results from the series of regression models shown
in this report are presented in levels and converted to
relative percentage differences in this report because this
information provides a more intuitive interpretation of
the magnitude of seasonal variation relative to the average
rate across the time period. These percentages are obtained
by comparing the coefficient for each season against
the estimated comparison rate (typically the summer)
represented by the constant. The regression results that
resulted in the percentages shown in appendix tables 1–4.
