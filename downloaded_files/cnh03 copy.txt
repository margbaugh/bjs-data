Highlights
                     
The percentage of U.S. households that experienced a crime fell from
25% to 15% in the 10 years between 1994 and 2003

Both property and violent crimes declined: property crime from 21% of 
all households in 1994 to 13% in 2003, and violent crime from 7% to 3%.

*  In 2003 about 17 million households experienced one or more property
crimes or had a member age 12 or older who experienced one or more
violent crimes.

*  The percentage of households experiencing crimes, about 15%, did
not change significantly between 2002 and 2003.

*  About 1 in every 26 households in 2003 were either burglarized or
had a member age 12 or older who was a victim of a violent crime 
committed by a stranger.

*  In 2003 about 3 in 1,000 households included a member victimized
by an intimate partner, such as a spouse, ex-spouse, boyfriend, or
girlfriend.  

*  About 5% of households had at least one incident of vandalism in
2003.  Over 5.8 million households were vandalized during this period.

In 2003, 15% of the households in the United States, accounting for 17
million households, experienced 1 or more violent or property crimes as
measured by the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). These
crimes include rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple
assault, purse snatching or pocket picking, household burglary, motor
vehicle theft, and theft.

In 2003, 3% of households had a member age 12 or older who experienced 
one or more violent crimes.  Simple assault was the type of violent 
crime most often sustained. Thirteen percent of households experienced 
one or more property crimes, with theft the most frequent type. There 
were no significant differences between 2002 and 2003 in the percentage 
of households experiencing total crimes, violent crimes or property 
crimes; however, both violent and property crime declined between 1994 
and 2003.  

Measuring crime by counting the affected households gives an understanding 
of the dispersion of crime in the Nation. Some households account for 
multiple victimizations. When interpreted in relation to the criminal
victimization statistics reported in the annual BJS Bulletin (such
as Criminal Victimization, 2003, <http://www.ojp.
usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cv03.htm>) the households-victimized-by-crime
indicator focuses on the national proportion of households that
experience crime.  

13% of U.S. households had one or more property 
crimes in 2003

About 17 million households experienced 1 or more of the victimizations
measured by the NCVS, an ongoing household survey that collects information
about crimes both unreported and reported to the police. These victimized
households made up about 15% of the 114.1 million households in the United
States. Victimized households experienced some type of property crime or 
had a member age 12 or older who was victimized by violence. Theft, 
affecting 1 in 10 households, was the most frequent crime of those 
measured.

About 3% of households had an adolescent or adult member who was
victimized by one or more crimes of violence during the year. (NCVS
interviews all members of a household age 12 or older and does not
estimate victimizations of children younger than 12). About 2.3 million
households had members who experienced simple assault, the most
frequent type of violence encountered. Simple assault does not result
in serious injury and does not involve a weapon.  

For the households-victimized-by-crime measure, households that
experienced the same type of crime more than once were counted only
once for that victimization. For example, a household with two members
who were assaulted or with a member who was assaulted more than
once, was counted only once for assault. Similarly, a household
burglarized several times during the year was counted only once for
burglary.    

In 2003 less than 1% of households had members victimized by more than 
one type of violence, including rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
assault.  About 1% of households were victimized by both violent and
property crimes. Such households were counted once in the violent crime
measure, once in the property crime measure, and once in the overall
measure.  

About 1 in every 26 households experienced violence by a stranger or a
household burglary during 2003. The portion of households affected by
these NCVS crimes, often cited as among the most fear provoking, has
fallen since 1994 but did not change between 2002 and 2003. These
"crimes of high concern" affected 3.9% of households In 2003.

----------------------------------------------------
Vandalism of residences or other  property owned by an individual    

Over 5.8 million households,  5.1% of all U.S. households, had at 
least one incident of vandalism in 2003.  First compiled by the NCVS 
in 2000, vandalism is not included in the overall measure of 
households experiencing victimization. If vandalism is included in 
the overall measure, the total percentage of households experiencing 
a crime rises from 15% to 18%.
--------------------------------------------------

Intimate partner violence affected about 3 households 
in 1,000 during 2003

Less than 1% of all households experienced intimate partner violence,
which is violence committed by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, 
or girlfriend. Intimate partner violence declined between 1994 and 2003.
The household-victimized-by-crime indicator does not measure repeated
victimizations or victimizations of more than one household member
during the year.      

Black and Hispanic households more vulnerable to crime

In 2003 households headed by blacks were more likely to experience crime 
(16%) than those headed by whites (14%). Households headed by Hispanics 
(18%) were more likely to sustain one or more crimes than those headed by
non-Hispanics (14%).***The Office of Management and Budget introduced new
guidelines for the collection and reporting of race and ethnicity data in 
all government demographic surveys. As of January 1, 2003, persons 
previously asked to select a single primary race are allowed to identify 
more than one racial category. In this report persons are classified as 
solely white, black, or other race or as having more than one race.***

Prevalence of crime higher for urban households, 
large households, and those in the West

Households in urban areas (19%) were more likely to experience one
or more crimes than suburban households (13%) and rural households
(12%)in 2003.

Household size affected the likelihood  of experiencing criminal
victimization in 2003. Twenty-eight percent of households with six 
or more persons experienced one or more crimes compared with 21% of
households made up of four or five persons, 14% of households with 
two or three persons, and 10% of one-person households.  

Households located in the West were more likely to experience one or
more crimes when compared with house-holds in other regions of the
country.

Prevalence of crime in households decreased from 
1994 to 2003

About 1 in 7 households experienced one or more crimes in 2003, compared 
to 1 in 4 households in 1994. The percentage of households experiencing 
either violent or property crime also declined. In 2003, 3% of households 
had a member who experienced at least one violent crime, compared to 7%
in 1994. For property crimes, 13% of households were affected in 2003,
compared to 21% in 1994.

Methodology

This Bulletin presents data on nonlethal violence and property crimes
from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). In 2003, 83,660
households and 149,040 people age 12 or older were interviewed. For
the 2003 NCVS data presented here, the  response rate was 91.6% of
eligible households and 86.3% of eligible individuals.

The households-victimized-by-crime measure counts each household once 
for the calendar year, regardless of the number of times a household
experienced a particular type of crime. For the overall indicator,
household-based crime estimates are derived from NCVS statistics on
rape/sexual assault, robbery, assault, personal theft, household 
burglary, household theft, and motor vehicle theft. A household is 
counted if anyone in the household experienced one or more of any of 
these crimes within the year. For categories such as violent crime by 
a stranger or intimate partner crime, a household is counted if person(s) 
in the households were victimized one or more times by that particular 
type of crime.

Detailed information about the construction of the
households-victimized-by-crime measure, as well as data about
households in prior years, is available in Crime and the Nation's
Households, 2000, With Trends, 1994-2000,

explanation about general survey methodology and estimates of
standard error, see the BJS Bulletin Criminal Victimization, 2003,
