The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA; P.L. 108-
79) requires the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to carry
out, for each calendar year, a comprehensive statistical
review and analysis of the incidence and effects of prison
rape. The Act further specifies that the review and analysis
shall be based on a random sample, or other scientifically
appropriate sample of not less than 10 percent of all
federal, state, and county prisons, and a representative
sample of municipal prisons. In 2010 more than 7,600
facilities nationwide were covered by the Act. The
Act requires the Attorney General to submit a report, not
later than June 30 of each year, listing institutions in the
sample and ranking them according to the incidence of prison
rape. BJS has developed a multiple-measure, multiple-mode
data collection strategy to fully implement requirements
under PREA.

Data collections during 2010 and 2011

National Survey of Youth in Custody (NSYC) provided the first
facility-level estimates of youth reporting sexual
victimization in juvenile facilities, as required under PREA.
The report, Sexual Victimization in Juvenile Facilities
Reported by Youth, 2008-09, was released in January 2010. It
was based on 9,198 completed interviews with adjudicated
youth in 166 state facilities and 29 large locally or
privately operated facilities.

The data collection was complex, requiring review from dozens
of Institutional Review Boards at the state and local levels,
obtaining consent from either the sampled youths' parents
or guardians or in loco parentis from administrators of each
facility, ensuring youth understood the survey assent
process, providing appropriate services for youth should they
request to speak to someone outside the facility, and
following individual state laws on mandatory reporting of
child abuse and neglect.
Each interview was conducted in a private setting using audio
computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) technology with a
laptop touchscreen and an audio feed to maximize respondent
confidentiality and minimize literacy issues. The data
collected represent approximately 26,550 adjudicated youth
held nationwide. (See the report for detailed methodology and
definitions.)

Among the findings 

*An estimated 12% of youth in state juvenile facilities and
large non-state facilities reported experiencing one or
more incidents of sexual victimization by another youth or
facility staff in the past 12 months or since admission, if
less than 12 months.

*About 2.6% of youth reported an incident involving
another youth, and 10.3% reported an incident involving
facility staff.

*About 4.3% of youth reported having sex or other sexual
contact with facility staff as a result of some type of force
or threat of force; 6.4% of youth reported sexual contact
with facility staff without any force, threat, or other
explicit form of coercion.

*Approximately 95% of all youth reporting staff sexual
misconduct said they had been victimized by female staff.
In 2008, 42% of staff in state juvenile facilities were
female.

*Among youth victimized by another youth, 20% said
they had been physically injured; 5% reported they had
sought medical attention for their injuries. Among youth
victimized by staff, 5% reported a physical injury; fewer
than 1% had sought medical attention.

The second collection (NSYC-2) is under review by the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB). Based on feedback from
juvenile administrators and experts in investigating
allegations of child abuse and neglect, BJS has added new
items to measure the accuracy of youth self-reports, included
new items to more fully understand staff sexual misconduct,
developed methods to enhance response rates, and expanded the
sample to include youth held in smaller facilities and
facilities under contract to state juvenile correctional
authorities. A new component of NSYC-2 is the collection of
information about each facility and living unit. NSYC-2 will
collect data on facility staffing, use of video surveillance,
characteristics of youth held, and factors related to
placement of youth in different living units within the
facility.

Field operations for the NSYC, including recruitment,
Institutional Review Board processing, and site visit
planning, will begin following OMB clearance in July 2011.
Interviewing of youth is expected to begin in February 2012.
When the data collection is completed in early 2013, BJS will
produce national estimates, facility-level estimates in large
facilities, and state-level estimates of alleged sexual
victimization.

National Inmate Survey (NIS) gathers data on the incidence
of sexual assault in adult prisons and local jail facilities,
as reported by inmates using ACASI technology with a
laptop touchscreen and an audio feed to maximize inmate
confidentiality and minimize literacy issues. The first NIS
(NIS-1) was conducted in 2007, producing two reports:
Sexual Victimization in State and Federal Prisons Reported by
Inmates, 2007 and Sexual Victimization in Local Jails
Reported by Inmates, 2007. The second NIS (NIS-2) was
conducted between October 2008 and December 2009, producing a
combined prison and jail report: Sexual Victimization in
Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2008-09.

*NIS-2 was conducted in 167 state and federal prisons,
286 local jails, and 10 special correctional facilities
(operated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),
Indian tribes, or the U.S. Armed Services). A total
of 81,566 inmates participated in the survey, including
32,029 prison inmates, 48,066 jail inmates, 957 ICE
detainees, 399 inmates in facilities operated by the U.S.
Armed Services, and 115 inmates in Indian country
facilities.

*Rates of alleged sexual victimization were unchanged
between NIS-1 and NIS-2. In NIS-2, an estimated
4.4% of prison inmates and 3.1% of jail inmates
reported experiencing one or more incidents of sexual
victimization by another inmate or facility staff in the
past 12 months or since admission to the facility, if less
than 12 months. In NIS-1, 4.5% of prisoners and 3.2% of
jail inmates reported having been sexually victimized.

*BJS used the NIS-2 to provide more in-depth analyses of
different types of victimization, inmate risk factors, and
circumstances surrounding victimization. To address
PREA requirements, BJS identified facilities as having
high or low rates based on each type of victimization,
and statistical criteria applied to the lower and upper
bounds of confidence intervals associated with the survey
estimates.

*The third NIS collection (NIS-3), in which data
collection began in January 2011, has been modified
to include measures of mental and physical health,
as well as indicators of facility safety and security.
When completed in early 2012, the NIS-3 will provide
additional information on inmate risk factors and will
identify facility characteristics related to variations in
sexual victimization.

Survey of Sexual Violence (SSV) collects data annually
on the incidence of sexual violence in adult and juvenile
correctional facilities. This administrative records
collection, the first of a series of data collections
implemented to meet PREA mandates, began in 2004. The surveys
include measures of four different types of sexual violence,
and it is administered to a sample of at least 10% of all
correctional facilities covered under the Act. Additional
detail is collected on the characteristics of substantiated
incidents of sexual violence.

The administrative records surveys provide a basis for
the annual statistical review required under the Act. The
surveys include all federal and state prison systems, as
well as facilities operated by the U.S. Armed Services and
ICE. The surveys also include representative samples of jail
jurisdictions, privately operated adult prisons and jails,
and jails in Indian country. Each year the SSV also includes
all state operated juvenile facilities and a representative
sample of locally and privately operated juvenile facilities.

The report, Sexual Victimization Reported by Adult
Correctional Authorities, 2007-2008, was released in January
2011. Among the report's findings 

*Administrators of adult correctional facilities reported
7,444 allegations of sexual victimization in 2008 and
7,374 allegations in 2007.

*The number of allegations has risen since 2005, largely
due to increases in prisons, where allegations increased
21% (from 4,791 in 2005 to 5,796 in 2008).

*In 2008, 931 allegations of sexual victimization (13%)
were substantiated, that is, determined to have occurred
upon investigation.

*State prison administrators reported 589 substantiated
incidents of sexual victimization in 2008, up 28% from
459 in 2005.

*About 54% of substantiated incidents of sexual
victimization involved only inmates, while 46% of
substantiated incidents involved staff with inmates.

*Injuries were reported in about 18% of incidents of
inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization and less than 1%
of incidents of staff sexual victimizations.

Results of the 2007 09 juvenile surveys are expected in
November 2011.

Former Prisoner Survey (FPS) will provide a national
estimate of the incidence of sexual victimization based on
reports of former state prison inmates. Parole offices from
across the nation were sampled, and a selection of former
inmates under active parole supervision were interviewed
using ACASI technology. The survey collects data on the
totality of the prior term of incarceration, including any
time in a local jail, state prison, or community correctional
facility prior to final discharge.

*The methodology of FPS is not conducive to facility
ranking but will provide substantial data on the
characteristics of sexual victimization across facility types
and over time, as well as effects of victimization following
release from prison.

*Between January and November 2008, BJS conducted
FPS in a sample of 285 parole offices with nearly 18,000
former inmates. BJS is currently working on a final
report, expected to be released in September 2011.

Clinical Indicators of Sexual Violence in Custody (CISVC).
In collaboration with the National Institute of Justice (NIJ)
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
BJS is conducting a feasibility study using medical
indicators and medical surveillance methodologies. The study
will measure the incidence and prevalence of sexual assault
in correctional facilities.

*The CISVC is designed to be conducted in the health care
section of each participating correctional facility. As part
of routine medical practice, medical staff will complete
a surveillance form for adult male inmates who make an
allegation of sexual violence, display any of five clinical
conditions (i.e., unexplained rectal bleeding; rectal or
anal tears or fissures; bruises, scratches, or abrasions on
buttocks; genital bruising; or nipple injuries), or who
medical staff suspect have been victimized.

*Data collected in the CISVC will include the following:
victim age, height, weight, and race/Hispanic origin; a
general injury assessment; a mental health assessment;
and follow-up information.

*On April 30, 2011, CDC completed the 12-month data
collection period in 19 participating prisons and 11
jails. BJS, NIJ, and CDC are currently working on a joint
report, expected to be released in January 2012.
