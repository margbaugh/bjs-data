justice information by other organizations as listed under
Related Sites (http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/site.htm).  

The topics listed on the home page provide an easy way to locate
information. Under each topic are Summary Findings, which
provide the latest numbers in the format of a news magazine.  A
list of publications by BJS is also presented by topic or
subtopic, arranged with the most recent publication first. 
Information about the data collections and links to related
sites are also included under the topical listings.

Every publication produced by BJS in the last few years is
available electronically.  In addition to the listings on the
topical pages, you can find publications by title in
alphabetical order on the publications page, or, for recent
publications, under What's New at BJS.

Key Crime & Justice Facts at a Glance

Added to the website in April, 1997, Key Facts at a Glance
presents --

*  Crime trends 
*  Trends in Federal investigations and prosecutions 
*  Trends in felony convictions in State courts 
*  Corrections trends 
*  Expenditure trends

Several of the charts presented are also part of the Social
Statistics Briefing Room hosted by the White House at
http://www.whitehouse.gov/fsbr/ssbr.html.  These charts are
updated immediately upon the release of new data.

Internet users can find Key Facts at a Glance at
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance.htm. Small versions of
the charts (thumbnails) and brief statements of findings are
presented.  Click on the thumbnail and you will go to a page
that contains a full size version of the chart and additional
information about the data and findings. Click on the full
size version of the chart and a table with the data used in
the chart will appear.  This table is a text file which you
can save to your hard drive and import into most spreadsheet,
charting, and word processing programs. A complete list of the
charts in Key Facts at a Glance including the date of the most
recent update is in Appendix 1.

In addition, an electronic file is available that contains full
size color versions of selected charts suitable for overheads or
handouts.  Paper versions of these charts are available from the
Clearinghouse.  Please reference NCJ 170087 when ordering.

Crime & Justice Electronic 
Data Abstracts

Also added to the BJS website in April of 1997, Crime & Justice
Electronic Data Abstracts (CJEDA) are a series of spreadsheets
that contain data from a wide variety of published sources
usually by jurisdiction and over time.  You can use these
spreadsheets to find the answer to a particular question,
include the data in other analyses, or create your own graphs or
maps. 

The following are just a few examples of the types of questions
you can find answers to from the spreadsheets in CJEDA:

How many robberies were reported by the police in Iowa, each
year, 1964-96? 

Is there a relationship between the rate of homicide and level
of education of residents in the 90 largest counties?

How has the number of persons incarcerated in Texas changed
between 1977 and 1996? 

You can download these spreadsheets to your computer and open or
import them into most spreadsheet, charting, and word processing
programs. Most of these files are in .wk1 format (The MIME type
for these files is application/spreadsheet and the file
extension is wk1).  Many browsers can be configured to
automatically launch a spreadsheet program to display these
files. Consult the documentation of your browser for specific
instructions.  

A few of the holdings are a collection of files that are
archived into one .zip file to facilitate transfer from the
Internet. Additional help to unzip these files is available at
http:/www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/help.htm. Users who do not
have Internet access can order them on diskette from the
BJS Clearinghouse.

To allow users to find what they want, these spreadsheets are
indexed in two ways; by topic (Crime and arrest data, Criminal
justice data, Corrections data, Demographic data) or by
jurisdiction level (Federal, State, County, City).

The data in these spreadsheets come from many sources including
BJS statistical programs (correctional populations, Federal case
processing), the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) program of the FBI
(Index crime, homicide, and arrests), and the Bureau of the
Census (population numbers and noncriminal justice information).
The data included in these files are the most recent available
and are updated as new data become available.

The following files were added to this collection within the
last few months:

Time served in State prison, by offense, release type, sex, and
race, annually for 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996 from the National
Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP)

Sentence length of State prisoners, by offense, admission type,
sex, race, annually for 1993, 1994, 1995, and 1996 from the
National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP)

Most serious offense of State prisoners, by offense, admission
type, age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin, annually for 1993,
1994, 1995, and 1996 from the National Corrections Reporting
Program (NCRP)

Number of full-time sworn law enforcement officers, rate per
100,000 residents, and percent change since 1975 in the United
States, from the Uniform Crime Reports.

Recent updates include: 

*  Case processing data by Federal court district, 1996

*  Prisoners executed under civil authority in United States, by
year, region, and jurisdiction, 1977-1998

*  The number of arrests for violent crimes of juveniles (under
age 18) and adults (age 18 or older), 1970-97

*  Homicide victimization and offending rates of juveniles and
young adults, by State, 1976-97  

*  Index offense crimes and arrests, the 90 largest counties,
1990-96

The additions and updates to the CJEDA for the past six months
are announced on What's New from BJS.  

New sections available on the BJS website

Homicide Trends in the U.S.

Homicide Trends in the United States describes homicide patterns
and trends in the United States since 1976. Homicide is of
interest not only because of its severity but also because it is
a fairly reliable barometer of all violent crime. At a national
level, no other crime is measured as accurately and precisely.
The site displays 32 graphics and supporting tables and includes
the recently released 1997 data.  The site will be updated
annually.

Topics covered include long term trends, demographic trends,
multiple victims and offenders, infanticide, homicides by
intimates, law enforcement officers killed, weapons trends,
regional trends, and trends by city size. The data analyzed are
from the FBI's    Uniform Crime Reporting Program, particularly
the Supplementary Homicide Reports.

You can get to Homicide Trends from the BJS home page
(http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/homicide/homtrnd.htm).


Drugs and Crime Facts

This new section of the BJS website is an updated web version of
the publication, Drugs and Crime Facts, 1994.  Statistics on
drug-related crimes, law enforcement, courts, corrections, drug
use, and public opinion are summarized in an easy to use format.
Data from BJS series as well as other government sources
provide an online overview of drugs and crime.

Drugs and Crime Facts including nine graphs and numerous tables
is available from the Drugs and Crime page
(http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/dcf/contents).  Links to the
source materials for each entry are provided for users seeking
more detail.  As new data become available the site will be
updated and enhanced so that you can find the latest data
about drugs and crime.

Other electronic materials and publications from the BJS website

Trends in Juvenile Violence: 1997 Update

The original report, produced under a Bureau of Justice
Statistics grant, is based on a briefing of the Attorney General
in 1995 by Dr. James A. Fox, Dean, School of Criminal Justice,
Northeastern University.  Available in print from NCJRS, the
original report discusses demographic trends and their impact on
crime.  It concludes that the growth in juvenile population in
the next decade will cause a dramatic increase in the level of
juvenile violence. This update (NCJ 157315) presents results
through 1996.  Spreadsheets with data from both the original and
the updated version are available at
http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/tjvfox.htm.  

Most of the homicide data presented in these reports is
updated in the new section Homicide Trends in the United States.

BJS assessments of customer needs and usage

Striving to improve customer service, BJS has conducted the
following assessments:

Web statistics C Measuring user activity: An analysis of BJS
website usage    statistics, March 1998,  NCJ 171118

Mail Survey of Recipients of Bureau of Justice Statistics Print
Publications, May 1997,  NCJ 166369

The Flow of Criminal Justice Statistical Information by
Electronic Means, May 1996,   NCJ 172806

Papers in support of the National Incident Based Reporting System

The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, which began in
1929, collects information about crimes reported to the police.
Jointly sponsored by BJS and the FBI, a 5-year redesign effort
to provide more comprehensive and detailed crime statistics
resulted in the National Incident-Based Reporting System
(NIBRS). The UCR Program is currently being converted to NIBRS. 
To encourage adoption of NIBRS and the analysis of
incident-based data, BJS has prepared the following electronic
only reports:

State Use of Incident-Based Crime Statistics describes the
States'publication and dissemination of incident-based data, focusing
on the presentation of criminal statistics in tabular form.
February 1999, NCJ 173941 

Crime Data Requests 1994-96: A Review of Requests for Crime
Information from the State Law Enforcement Division of South
Carolina presents  findings from the review of data requests
made to the UCR Department of the South Carolina Law Enforcement
Division (SLED) to gain an improved understanding of the types
of criminal data most commonly requested and to identify
standard incident-based tables that could streamline SLED's
provision of information. March 1998, NCJ 170028



The World Factbook of Criminal Justice Systems

This factbook, developed under a BJS grant, provides narrative
descriptions of the criminal justice systems of countries around
the world. These 42 country descriptions are written to a common
template so that comparisons of similar functions in different
countries can be easily made. They were completed in mid-1993,
although the most recent data available for inclusion were
sometimes for a year or two earlier.

The introductory materials include:

Spreadsheets that support publications

BJS also provides data from the tables of some publications in
spreadsheet format.  In many instances, these files not only
include the published tables but also additional detail, data
used to calculate published rates or percentages, or the
formulas used.  You can use these spreadsheets to include the
data in other analyses, create your own graphs or maps, or, in
some instances, view additional details that are not in the
published report. 

Like the Crime and Justice Electronic Data Abstracts, these
files can be downloaded and imported into most spreadsheet,
charting, and word processing programs. The table on this page
lists those publications for which such data are available.  A
link to these files is included on the publication's web
abstract.  The address of the abstract is included on the table.
 
Most of these files are either text files or spreadsheets in 
.wk1 format although a few of the holdings are a collection of
files that are archived into one .zip file to facilitate
transfer from the Internet. From the abstract, click on
spreadsheets and the file will download to your computer where
you can open it and use it.  Additional help to unzip these
files is available at http:/www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/help.htm.  

Users who do not have Internet access can order the spreadsheets
on diskette from the BJS Clearinghouse (please reference the NCJ
number of the publication.)

The Federal Justice Statistics Resource Center (FJSRC), created
by the Urban Institute, provides online access to the BJS
Federal Justice Statistics Program database about cases
processed in the Federal criminal justice system.  Through the
FJSRC website (http://fjsrc.urban.org/) users may interactively
query the database and download datasets for more detailed
analysis.  Data for 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 are available
online.

The National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) offers an
interactive data analysis system for selected NACJD studies
(http://icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/SDA/das.html). You can produce
crosstabulations, descriptive statistics, and frequencies or
subset cases into extracts which can be downloaded for further
analysis.  Several homicide, victimization and corrections studies,
as well as the substance abuse and mental health data from ICPSR,
are available in the data analysis system.
