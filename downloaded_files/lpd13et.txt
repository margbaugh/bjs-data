Local Police Departments, 2013: Equipment and Technology

Brian A. Reaves, Ph.D., BJS Statistician


The overall percentage of the more than 12,000 local police 
departments in the United States authorizing the use of conducted 
energy weapons (CEWs) increased from 7% in 2000 to 81% in 2013 
(figure 1). CEWs include Tasers and stun guns. Large increases 
were observed in all population categories. About 9 in 10 
departments also authorized their officers to use pepper spray 
and batons in 2013.

Findings are based on the 2013 Law Enforcement Management and 
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) Survey sponsored by the Bureau 
of Justice Statistics (BJS). The LEMAS Survey, conducted 
periodically since 1987, collects data from a nationally 
representative sample of state and local law enforcement 
agencies. Prior to the 2013 survey, the most recent LEMAS Survey 
was conducted in 2007.

This report uses data from the 2013 LEMAS Survey to describe the 
equipment (such as nonlethal weapons and body armor) and 
technology (such as video cameras, license plate readers, and 
websites) used by local police departments. Comparisons are made 
with prior years where appropriate, and when data are available.

*****************************************************

To facilitate the comparison of police departments with others 
serving similarly sized jurisdictions, the statistics in this 
report are presented mainly by categories of population served. 
Because most departments employ small numbers of officers and 
serve small populations, overall agency-based percentages tend to 
reflect smaller departments more than larger ones (see appendix 
table 1). 

************************************************
An estimated 85% of departments serving 2,500 
or more residents authorized the use 
of conducted energy weapons
************************************************

In 2013, more than 80% of the departments in each population 
category of 2,500 or more authorized their officers to use CEWs 
(table 1). Overall, 85% of departments serving 2,500 or more 
residents authorized CEWs, compared to 75% of departments serving 
fewer than 2,500 residents. Nationwide, about 10,000 departments 
authorized CEWs.

At least 95% of the departments in each population category of 
10,000 or more authorized their officers to use pepper spray in 
2013. This included all departments serving 500,000 or more 
residents. More than 90% of the departments serving fewer than 
10,000 residents authorized pepper spray. The overall percentage 
of departments authorizing pepper spray in 2013 (94%) was about 
the same as in 2000 (91%) and 2007 (97%) (not shown).

In 2013, the use of batons was authorized by at least 95% of the 
departments in each population category of 50,000 or more, 
including all departments serving 500,000 or more residents. More 
than 90% of the departments serving 10,000 to 49,999 residents, 
and more than 80% of the departments serving fewer than 10,000 
residents authorized batons. The overall percentage of 
departments authorizing batons in 2013 (87%) was about the same 
as in 2000 (88%) but less than in 2007 (93%) (not shown).

A majority of the departments in each population category 
authorized the use of defensive physical tactics by officers in 
2013. These actions included open-hand (91% of all departments), 
takedown (89%), and closed-hand techniques (85%) (appendix table 
2). An estimated 18% of departments authorized the use of neck 
(lateral vascular) restraint tactics.

***********************************************
About 7 in 10 departments required uniformed 
officers to wear protective body armor at all 
times while in the field
***********************************************

In 2013, 71% (about 8,700) of departments required uniformed 
officers to wear protective body armor at all times while in the 
field (table 2). Departments serving 25,000 to 99,999 residents 
(89%) were the most likely to require officers to wear armor at 
all times, and those serving fewer than 2,500 residents (54%) 
were the least likely.

Departments with a mandatory body armor requirement employed 82% 
of all local police officers in 2013, compared to 67% in 2007, 
and 25% in 1990 (figure 2). An additional 8% of departments 
required uniformed field officers to wear armor in certain high-
risk situations, such as when serving warrants. The 79% of 
departments with any type of body armor requirement in 2013 
employed 92% of all officers, compared to 80% in 2007, and 30% in 
1990.

According to data published by the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI), 93% of the 511 nonfederal law enforcement 
officers feloniously killed in the line of duty between 2004 and 
2013 were killed by a firearm.***Footnote 1 Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (2014). Law Enforcement Officers Killed and 
Assaulted, 2013***. An FBI study on protection provided by body 
armor concluded that the risk of fatality for officers assaulted 
with a firearm while not wearing body armor was 14 times higher 
than for officers wearing body armor.*** Footnote 2 Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (1995). Law Enforcement Officers Killed 
and Assaulted, 1994***

***************************************************
About three-quarters of departments used in-car, 
body-worn, or weapon-attached video cameras
***************************************************

From 2007 to 2013, the percentage of departments using in-car 
video cameras increased in all population categories (figure 3). 
By 2013, a majority of the departments in each population 
category were using in-car cameras. Overall, 68% (about 8,400) of 
all departments used in-car cameras in 2013, and these 
departments employed 73% of all officers.

For the first time in 2013, the LEMAS Survey asked local police 
departments about the use of body-worn and weapon-attached 
cameras by their patrol officers. An estimated 32% (about 3,900) 
of departments reported they provided body-worn cameras for at 
least some of their patrol officers (table 3). Departments using 
body-worn cameras employed 24% of all officers. Six percent 
(about 800) of departments, employing 9% of all officers, used 
cameras attached to weapons.

Overall, 76% (about 9,300) of departments, employing 78% of all 
officers, used in-car, body-worn, or weapon-attached cameras in 
2013. The LEMAS Survey did not ask agencies about the number of 
cameras that were used.

*******************************************
About 1 in 6 departments used automated 
license plate readers
*******************************************

An estimated 17% (about 2,000) of departments used automated 
license plate readers in 2013. This total included more than 
three-quarters of the departments serving 100,000 or more 
residents. About half (49% or 6,000) of all departments used 
video cameras for surveillance of public areas, including more 
than two-thirds of the departments serving 25,000 or more 
residents.

Small percentages of departments in each population category of 
50,000 or more reported using unmanned aerial vehicles (drones). 
Such systems typically use video or thermal cameras as a low-cost 
alternative to conventional aircraft (such as helicopters) to 
provide aerial, real-time information without placing personnel 
in potentially dangerous situations.

In total, 89% (about 11,000) of local police departments were 
using some type of video camera technology in 2013 (not shown). 
Some departments also used advanced audio technology in the form 
of gunshot detection systems. Gunshot detection systems were used 
by 4% of departments, including 50% of those serving 1 million or 
more residents (table 4).

*****************************************************
About 9 in 10 local police officers were employed 
by a department that provided in-field computerized 
access to vehicle and driving records
*****************************************************

In 2013, about two-thirds of all departments provided in-field 
computerized access to vehicle records (70%), driving records 
(70%), and outstanding warrants (67%) (table 5). More than 90% of 
the departments serving 25,000 or more residents provided 
officers with in-field access to this information.

About half of departments provided officers with in-field access 
to information about prior calls for service at an address (55%) 
and criminal histories (53%). A majority of the departments 
serving 2,500 or more residents provided officers with access to 
this information.

The percentage of local police officers employed by a department 
that provided in-field computer access to various types of 
critical information increased from 2007 to 2013. For example, 
departments providing patrol officers with in-field computer 
access to vehicle records employed 93% of all officers in 2013, 
compared to 86% in 2007 (figure 4).

*****************************************************
About two-thirds of departments had patrol 
officers transmit incident reports electronically 
from the field to a central information system
*****************************************************

In 2013, more than three-quarters of the departments serving 
10,000 or more residents used electronic methods to transmit 
criminal incident reports from the field to a central information 
system, and nearly two-thirds of the departments serving fewer 
than 10,000 residents transmitted incident reports electronically 
(figure 5). In 2000, fewer than a third of departments in any 
population category used electronic methods. Overall, 68% of 
departments transmitted incident reports electronically from the 
field in 2013. An estimated 25% of departments used paper 
reports, and 7% used voice transmission (table 6).

****************************************************
Among departments serving 10,000 or more 
residents, more than 90% had their own website 
and more than 80% used social media
****************************************************

A majority of the local police departments in each population 
category of 2,500 or more maintained a website and used social 
media in 2013 (table 7). Among departments serving 10,000 or more 
residents, more than 90% maintained a website, and more than 80% 
used social media. More than 90% of the departments serving 
50,000 or more residents used social media. Departments using 
social media were more likely to report using Facebook (75%) than 
Twitter (24%) or YouTube (10%) (not shown). Overall, more than 
7,000 departments had a website and used social media. These 
departments employed about 90% of all officers.

Sixty-six percent of all departments provided citizens with the 
ability to submit crime reports, complaints, questions, feedback, 
and other information electronically using the department’s 
website and other methods, such as emailing or texting (table 8). 
More than 90% of the departments serving 50,000 or more provided 
these services, compared to 47% of the departments serving fewer 
than 2,500 residents.

Overall, 60% of departments were able to electronically provide 
crime statistics and other crime-related information to citizens. 
An estimated 37% of departments provided such information through 
their website, and 49% provided it through other electronic 
means, such as emailing, texting, or pre-recorded phone messages. 
More than 90% of the departments serving 25,000 or more residents 
provided crime-related information electronically to citizens, 
compared to 37% of the departments serving fewer than 2,500 
residents.

*****************************************************
Most websites operated by departments serving 
250,000 or more residents included crime statistics 
at the district, neighborhood, beat, or street level
*****************************************************

A majority of the websites operated by departments serving 50,000 
or more residents provided citizens with jurisdiction-wide crime 
statistics, compared to 13% of websites operated by departments 
serving fewer than 10,000 residents (figure 6). About 3 in 4 
websites operated by departments serving 250,000 or more 
residents provided crime statistics at the district, beat, 
neighborhood, or street level during 2013.

Methodology
**************

Survey overview
****************

The LEMAS Survey periodically collects data from more than 3,000 
general purpose law enforcement agencies, including state police 
and highway patrol agencies, local police departments, and 
sheriffs’ offices. The survey includes all agencies that employ 
100 or more sworn officers and a nationally representative sample 
of smaller agencies.

Previous LEMAS data collections occurred in 1987, 1990, 1993, 
1997, 2000, 2003, and 2007. These past surveys obtained data on 
functions performed, operating expenditures, job functions of 
sworn and nonsworn employees, officer salaries and special pay, 
demographic characteristics of officers, education and training 
requirements, community policing activities, types of weapons 
authorized, body armor policies, computers and information 
systems, types of vehicles operated, the use of special units, 
and task force participation. A more limited data collection that 
focused on community policing was conducted in 1999. Survey 
questions are updated with each iteration to reflect emerging 
issues in the field of law enforcement. Publications based on 
prior LEMAS Surveys can be accessed on the BJS website.

Sampling frame
****************

The sampling frame used for the 2013 LEMAS Survey was the 2008 
BJS Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA) 
(the most recent available). At the time of the 2008 CSLLEA, 
nearly all of the more than 12,000 police departments were 
operated at the sub-county level by individual municipal (85%) or 
township (13%) governments. The remainder were operated by tribal 
governments, multiple local governments (regional or joint 
departments), or county governments.

The agency universe represented by the CSLLEA is more inclusive 
than that of the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. 
Some agencies are excluded from the UCR counts because they do 
not have an Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) assigned by the 
FBI. (Some agencies without an ORI are still included in the UCR 
employee counts (but not in the agency counts) because they 
report their data to another agency, which reports it to the 
FBI.)

The CSLLEA data include all officers with full arrest powers 
regardless of function, while the UCR data exclude officers not 
paid out of police funds. This exclusion generally pertains to 
officers working exclusively for jails or courts. The CSLLEA 
definition excludes many of these officers, but not all of them.

The UCR program defines law enforcement officers as individuals 
who ordinarily carry a firearm and a badge, have full arrest 
powers, and are paid from governmental funds set aside 
specifically for sworn law enforcement representatives. The 
CSLLEA definition relies exclusively on whether the officer 
possesses full arrest powers. Regardless of the arrest powers of 
their officers, agencies included in the CSLLEA that do not have 
a primary jurisdictional area for which they provide law 
enforcement services are considered out of scope for the LEMAS 
Survey because of its policing focus.

In 2008, the CSLLEA counted 765,246 full-time sworn officers, 
which was about 57,000 (or 8%) more than the 708,569 reported by 
the UCR. A similar difference was observed for the 2004 and 2000 
CSLLEA collections. Although the CSLLEA counts are larger than 
those of the UCR, the employment growth trends recorded by the 
CSLLEA over time have been consistent with those recorded by the 
UCR.

Sample design and selection
****************************

Local police departments and sheriffs’ offices are chosen for the 
LEMAS Survey using a stratified sample design based on the number 
of sworn personnel. The original 2013 LEMAS sample included 3,336 
state and local law enforcement agencies. It was designed to be 
representative of all general purpose state and local law 
enforcement agencies in the United States, with separate samples 
drawn of local police departments and sheriffs’ offices. All 50 
primary state law enforcement agencies (state police and highway 
patrol) were included. Agencies serving special jurisdictions 
(such as schools, airports, or parks), or with special 
enforcement responsibilities (such as conservation laws or 
alcohol laws), were considered out of scope for the survey.

The 2013 LEMAS sample design called for 2,353 local police 
departments, divided into 7 strata based on the number of sworn 
officers employed, to receive the survey. During the initial 
contact phase, it was determined that 26 of these departments had 
closed since the 2008 CSLLEA and were dropped from the sample. Of 
the remaining 2,327 departments, the sample design called for all 
659 departments employing 100 or more full-time sworn personnel 
to be self-representing (SR) and receive the survey. It was later 
determined that 29 of these SR departments did not receive the 
survey because of inaccurate contact information. As a result, 
the base weight for SR departments is 1.046 instead of the 
expected 1.000. The 6 remaining strata and their corresponding 
base weights are 50 to 99 officers, 2.572; 25 to 49 officers, 
4.225; 10 to 24 officers, 6.260; 5 to 9 officers, 7.288; 2 to 4 
officers, 14.611; and 1 officer, 31.302.

Agency response rate
**********************

Of the 2,327 eligible local police departments that received the 
survey, 2,059 completed it, for a response rate of 88%. By size, 
the response rate ranged from 91% for departments with 50 or more 
officers to 84% for those with fewer than 10 officers. An 
adjustment factor unique to each stratum was used to account for 
nonresponse. These nonresponse adjustments and the resulting 
final analytical weights for each stratum are included in 
appendix table 9.

Item nonresponse and imputations
**********************************

All departments, regardless of size, were asked to complete the 
80-item CJ-44 survey questionnaire. A majority of the responses 
were received electronically through a survey website. For the 
2,059 departments completing the survey, item nonresponse rates 
due to omission or invalid data were low for the data elements 
used in this report (appendix table 10).

When a department did not supply a response to a numerical item, 
a ratio imputation method was used. The ratio imputation used the 
value of the ratio of the numerical variable to the number of 
full-time sworn personnel for departments that provided the 
numerical data. This ratio was computed for each population 
category and applied to the number of full-time sworn personnel 
in departments with the missing data to produce the imputed 
value. Imputations were not used for categorical variables.

Accuracy of the estimates
**************************

The accuracy of the estimates presented in this report depends on 
two types of error: sampling and nonsampling. Sampling error is 
the variation that may occur by chance because a sample was used 
rather than a complete enumeration of the population. Nonsampling 
error can be attributed to many sources, such as the inability to 
obtain information about all cases in the sample; inability to 
obtain complete and correct information from the administrative 
records; and processing errors. In any survey, the full extent of 
the nonsampling error is never known.

The sampling error, as measured by an estimated standard error, 
varies by the size of the estimate and the sample size. Because 
the LEMAS data were collected from a sample, the results are 
subject to sampling error. Variance and standard error estimates 
for the 2013 LEMAS were generated using the SUDAAN statistical 
software package. The Taylor linearization method for a 
“stratified without replacement” design was used for these 
calculations. See appendix tables for the standard error 
estimates.

These standard error estimates may be used to construct 
confidence intervals around percentages in this report. For 
example, the 95%-confidence interval around the percentage of 
local police departments using body-worn cameras is 32% ± 1.96 × 
1.4% (or approximately 29% to 35%).

These standard errors may also be used to test the significance 
of the difference between two sample statistics by pooling the 
standard errors of the two sample estimates. For example, the 
standard error of the difference between departments serving 
10,000 to 24,999 residents and those serving 2,500 to 9,999 
residents for using license plate readers would be 2.3% (or the 
square root of the sum of the squared standard errors for each 
group). The 95%-confidence interval around the difference would 
be 1.96 × 2.3% (or 4.6%). Because the observed difference of 14% 
(24% minus 10%) is greater than 4.6%, the difference would be 
considered statistically significant.
