Correctional Populations
in the United States, 2013

Lauren E. Glaze and Danielle Kaeble, BJS Statisticians

An estimated 6,899,000 persons were under the supervision of 
adult correctional systems at yearend 2013, down from 6,940,500 
at yearend 2012 (figure 1). The decrease of 41,500 offenders in 
2013 resulted in the number of persons under correctional 
supervision falling below 6.9 million for the first time since 
2003. The decline in the population during 2013 (down 0.6%) was 
less than 1% for the second consecutive year, down from 2.1% in 
2010 when the fastest annual decline in the population was 
observed. About 1 in 35 adults in the United States was under 
some form of correctional supervision at yearend 2013. This 
rate was unchanged from 2012, when it dropped to the lowest 
rate observed since 1997.

This report summarizes data from several Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (BJS) correctional data collections to provide 
statistics on the total population supervised by adult 
correctional systems in the United States. (See Methodology for 
sources.) These systems include offenders living in the 
community while supervised by probation or parole agencies and 
those under the jurisdiction of state or federal prisons or 
held in local jails.

HIGHLIGHTS
************

* An estimated 6,899,000 persons were under the supervision of 
adult correctional systems at yearend 2013, a decline of about 
41,500 from yearend 2012.

* The correctional population declined 0.6% during
2013, down from 2.1% in 2010 when the fastest annual
decline in the population was observed.

* About 1 in 35 adults (2.8%) in the United States was
under some form of correctional supervision at yearend
2013, unchanged from 2012.

* For the second consecutive year, the community
supervision (down 0.6%) and incarcerated (down 0.5%)
populations declined by less than 1%.

* About 1 in 51 adults was on probation or parole at
yearend 2013, compared to 1 in 110 adults incarcerated
in prison or local jail.

* All of the decline in the correctional population during
2013 resulted from decreases in the probation (down
32,100) and local jail (down 13,300) populations.

* While the U.S. prison population increased during 2013
(up 4,300 prisoners), the federal prison population
(down 1,900) decreased for the first time since 1980.

* Since 2010, the female jail population has been the
fastest growing correctional population, increasing by
an average of 3.4% annually.

***********************************
During 2013, the community supervision 
and incarcerated populations declined 
by less than 1%  
***********************************

The 41,500 decline in the correctional population during 2013 
was attributed to decreases in both the community supervision 
and incarcerated populations.***Footnote 1 Because offenders 
with multiple correctional statuses are excluded from the total 
correctional population to avoid double counting offenders, the 
sum of the community supervision and incarcerated populations 
and the change in the populations will not equal the total 
correctional population. See table 6 and Methodology***.  An 
estimated 4,751,400 persons were on probation or parole at the 
end of 2013, representing about 7 in 10 offenders under  
correctional supervision (table 1).2 *** Footnote 2 The total 
community supervision population excludes parolees who were 
also on probation to avoid double counting offenders. See table 
6 and Methodology***.  (See appendix table 1 for correctional 
population estimates by jurisdiction.) 

During 2013, the number of persons under community supervision 
fell by 29,900, accounting for the majority of the decline in 
the total correctional population. For the second consecutive
year, the community supervision population decreased by less 
than 1%. The rate of decline in the community supervision 
population slowed between2010 (down 2.6%) and 2012 (down
0.7%). During 2013 (down 0.6%), the community supervision 
population declined at rate that was relatively unchanged from 
the previous year. 

Similar to the community supervision population, the number of 
inmates in state and federal prisons and local jails dropped 
between 2012 (2,231,400) and 2013 (2,220,300).3***Footnote 3 
The total incarcerated population excludes prisoners who were 
held in a local jail to avoid double counting inmates. See 
table 6 and Methodology***.  The decrease of 11,100 inmates 
during the year was the smallest decrease in the incarcerated 
population since it first declined in 2009 (down 12,600). 
During 2011, the population decreased by 1.2%, the fastest 
annual rate of decline since 2009.

Since 2011, the rate of decline in the population slowed 
slightly, from 0.9% in 2012 to 0.5% in 2013.

About 8 in 10 offenders under community supervision at yearend
2013 were on probation (3,910,600), compared to about 2 in 10 
on parole (853,200). All of the decrease in the community 
supervision population during 2013 was attributed to the 
decline in the probation population (down 0.8% or 32,100). The 
small increase in the number of parolees (up 0.2% or 2,100) 
partially offset the decrease in the community supervision
population during the year. 

At yearend 2013, about 70% of the incarcerated population was 
under the jurisdiction of state or federal prisons (1,574,700), 
compared to 30% held in local jails (731,200). However, the
decrease in the number of local jail inmates (down 1.8% or 
13,300) during 2013 accounted for all of the decline in the 
incarcerated population.

Between 2012 and 2103, the U.S. prison population grew by 0.3% 
(4,300 prisoners), reversing a 3-year trend of decreases in the 
population. All of the increase in the U.S. prison population
was attributed to the increase in the number of inmates under 
the jurisdiction of state prisons (up 0.5% or 6,300). The  
growth in the U.S. prison population during 2013 masked the
first decline in the number of inmates under the jurisdiction 
of the Federal Bureau of Prisons (down 0.9% or 1,900) since 
1980.

***********************************
Correctional supervision rate
dropped during 2013, continuing a
6-year trend
***********************************

By yearend 2013, the correctional supervision rate declined to 
2,830 per 100,000 U.S. adult residents from 2,870 per 100,000 
at yearend 2012 (figure 2). The correctional supervision rate 
trended downward over the past 6 years, after reaching a peak 
of 3,210 per 100,000 adults in 2007. However, the decline 
during 2013 (down 1.5%) was less than the average annual 
decrease of 2.2% between 2007 and 2012.

Since the correctional population first declined during 2008, 
the trend in the correctional supervision rate diverged from 
the trend in the number of persons under correctional 
supervision. Compared to the decrease in the number of 
offenders under correctional supervision, the correctional 
supervision rate declined more rapidly. The number of persons
supervised by adult correctional systems decreased by an  
average of 1.0% each year from yearend 2007 to yearend 2013. In 
comparison, the average annual decline in the correctional 
supervision rate (down 2.1%) was twice as fast during the 
period. However, half of the decrease in the correctional 
supervision rate since 2007 was attributed to the increase in 
the size of the U.S. adult resident population. ***Footnote 4 
See Methodology for more information about the method used to 
decompose the decline in the correctional supervision rate***.

The rate of offenders under community supervision declined 
between 2012 and 2013, from 1,980 per 100,000 adults
to 1,950 per 100,000. (table 2). Since peaking at 2,240 per 
100,000 adults in 2007, the community supervision rate trended 
downward, accounting for three-quarters of the decline in
the correctional supervision rate from 2007 to 2013. By yearend 
2013, the incarceration rate also dropped slightly, to 910 per 
100,000 adults from 920 per 100,000 at yearend 2012. Since
2008 (1,000 per 100,000 adults), the incarceration rate 
declined steadily.

***********************************
Decreases in the probation and jail 
populations accounted for the decline 
in the correctional population during 
2013 
***********************************

Although the correctional population continued to decline 
between 2010 and 2013, the composition of the correctional 
population remained unchanged. Probationers accounted for the 
majority (57%) of offenders under correctional supervision in 
2010 and 2013, and prisoners (23%) made up almost a quarter of 
the population (table 3). Parolees and local jail inmates 
represented the smallest and equalshares of the correctional 
population in 2010 and 2013 (12% parolees and 11% jail 
inmates).

Between yearend 2012 and 2013, decreases in the probation and 
local jail populations led to the overall decline in the 
correctional population. Combined, the probation and jail
populations fell by 45,400 offenders during 2013 (table 4). The 
decline in the probation population accounted for 71% (down 
32,100) of the total decrease in the correctional population,
as the probation population represented the largest share of 
offenders under correctional supervision. The local jail
population also decreased during 2013, accounting for 29% (down 
13,300) of the total decline in the correctional population. 
Increases in the prison (up 4,300 prisoners) and parole (up 
2,100 parolees) populations slightly offset the overall 
decrease in the correctional population during the year.

Since 2010, the probation, prison, and jail populations 
declined by a total of 201,500 offenders, with the probation
population accounting for the majority (72%) of the decline. 
The parole population was the only correctional population to 
increase since 2010 (up 12,500), partially offsetting the 
overall decline in the correctional population over the 3-year 
period.

***********************************
Since 2000, the proportion of females
on probation and in jail increased;
the proportion of females in prison
and on parole remained stable
***********************************

At yearend 2013 (18%), females represented a slightly larger 
share of the total correctional population than in 2000 (17%) 
(figure 3). The small increase was associated with an increase
in the percentages of females supervised on probation and 
incarcerated in local jails. In 2013, females accounted for 
almost 25% of about the probation population, up from 22% in 2000. 
Similarly, females represented a larger share of the local
jail population in 2013 (14%) compared to 2000 (11%). The 
percentage of females on parole or incarcerated in state or 
federal prison remained unchanged between 2000 and 2013.

***********************************
Female jail, prison, and probation
populations grew at a faster rate than
the male populations between 2000
and 2010
***********************************

The number of both males and females under correctional 
supervision increased between 2000 and 2010. An estimated 
1,264,100 females were supervised by adult correctional
systems at yearend 2010, up from about 1,078,400 at yearend 
2000 (table 5). The number of males under correctional
supervision reached approximately 5,824,400 by yearend 2010, up 
from 5,389,600 at yearend 2000. However, on average, females 
(up 1.6%) under correctional supervision grew at an annual rate 
that was twice the annual growth rate for males (up 0.8%)  
during the period.

While the number of males and females increased for all 
correctional populations between 2000 and 2010, the growth in 
females was faster than the growth in males for all populations
except parolees. The male (1.5%) and female (1.4%) parole 
populations increased at about the same rate each year on 
average. Among both males and females, the local jail 
population was the fastest growing correctional population 
between 2000 and 2010. However, on average, the female jail 
population (up 2.6%) grew at a faster rate annually than the 
male jail population (up 1.8%).

The number of females under the jurisdiction of state or 
federal prisons grew by 21% between 2000 and 2010, compared to 
about a 15% increase in the number of male prisoners.  
Consequently, the growth in the female prison population (up 
1.9% on average annually) was slightly faster than the growth 
in the male prison population (up 1.4%) during the period.
Between 2000 and 2010, the female probation population 
increased by 17%, or an average of 1.5% annually. In 
comparison, the male probation population grew by 2.6%, or an 
average rate of growth (up 0.3% per year) that was about a 
fifth the growth rate of female probationers.

***********************************
Since 2010, female jail inmates
increased 11% and male parolees
increased 2%; all other correctional
populations declined
***********************************

The decrease in both male and female correctional populations 
was consistent with the decline in the total number of persons 
supervised by adult correctional systems since 2010. However, 
while the number of males under correctional supervision 
declined by about 3.1% since 2010, the female correctional
population (down 0.6%) decreased by less than 1%. Compared to 
males (down 1.1%), the average annual rate of decline in the 
female correctional population (down 0.2%) was considerably 
slower. The number of males and females decreased across all 
correctional populations between 2010 and 2013, except for 
female jail inmates (up 11%) and male parolees (up 2%). Since 
2010, the female jail population increased by an average annual 
rate of 3.4%.

Methodology
****************

Sources of data
****************

The statistics presented in this report include data from 
various Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) data collections,
each relying on the voluntary participation of federal, state, 
and local respondents. For more information about any of the 
following data collections, go to the Data Collections
page www.bjs.gov. 

Annual Surveys of Probation 
and Parole. 
*********************************

The Annual Surveys of Probation and Parole (ASPP) began in
1980. They collect data from probation and parole agencies in 
the United States that supervise adults. Both surveys cover the 
50 states, the District of Columbia, and the federal system. 
BJS defines probation as a court-ordered period of correctional 
supervision in the community, generally as an alternative
to incarceration. In some cases, probation can be a combined 
sentence of incarceration followed by a period of community 
supervision. Parole is defined as a period of conditional
supervised release in the community following a prison term. It 
includes parolees released through discretionary or mandatory 
supervised release from prison, those released through other
types of post-custody conditional supervision, and those 
sentenced to a term of supervised release.

In these data, adults are persons who are subject to the 
jurisdiction of an adult court or correctional agency. Persons
age 17 or younger who were prosecuted in criminal court as if 
they were adults are considered adults, but persons age 17 or 
younger who were under the jurisdiction of a juvenile court or 
agency are excluded.

Annual Survey of Jails. 
***********************************

The Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) has collected data from a 
nationally representative sample of local jails each year since
1982, except in 1983, 1988, 1993, 1999, and 2005, when a 
complete census of U.S. local jails was conducted. Jails are 
confinement facilities, usually administered by a local law 
enforcement agency, that are intended to hold adults, but they 
may also hold youth age 17 or younger before or after they are 
adjudicated. The ASJ data used in this report include inmates 
age 17 or younger who were held either before or after they 
were adjudicated (about 4,600 persons in 2013).

To maintain the jail series in this report, all tables and 
figures include 2013 national estimates of the local jail 
population as of the last weekday in June that were provided 
through the ASJ, except appendix table 1. In 2013, BJS 
conducted another census of jails through an existing 
collection titled the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program. BJS 
relied on local jail counts provided for December 31 through 
the 2013 census to generate jurisdiction level estimates of the 
total incarcerated population and total correctional population 
that appear in appendix table 1. (ASJ is designed to provide 
only national estimates.) Because appendix table 1 includes the 
2013 local jail estimates as of December 31, the totals of the 
correctional and incarcerated populations reported in appendix 
table 1 are not consistent with the totals of the populations 
reported in the other tables and figures of this report. (See
Census of Jails and Deaths in Custody Reporting Program.)

Census of Jails. 
***********************************

The Census of Jails began in 1970 and was conducted in
1972, 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, 1999, 2005, and 2006. In 2013, 
BJS expanded the 2013 Deaths in Custody Reporting Program–
Annual Summary on Inmates under Jail Jurisdiction to act as the
2013 Census of Jails. The census is part of a series of data 
collection efforts, including the Census of Jail Inmates
and the Census of Jail Facilities, aimed at studying the 
nation’s jails and their inmate populations.

Deaths in Custody Reporting Program.
***********************************

The Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP) is an annual 
collection that provides national, state, and incident-level 
data on persons who died while in the physical custody of the 
50 state departments of corrections or the approximately 2,800 
local adult jail jurisdictions nationwide.

The DCRP began in 2000 under the Death in Custody Reporting Act 
of 2000 (P.L. 106-297), and it is the only national statistical 
collection to obtain comprehensive information about deaths in 
adult correctional facilities. In addition to the death count, 
BJS requests that jails provide summary statistics about their 
population and admissions. All jails, including those with no 
deaths to report (which includes about 80% of jails in any 
given year), are asked to complete the annual summary survey 
form.

National Prisoner Statistics Program.
***********************************

The National Prisoner Statistics (NPS)program began in 1926 
under a mandate from Congress and has been conducted annually. 
It collects data from the nation’s state departments of
corrections and the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP).

The NPS distinguishes between inmates in custody and prisoners 
under jurisdiction of correctional authorities. To have custody 
of a prisoner, a state or the BOP must hold that inmate in
one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction over a prisoner, 
the state or BOP must have legal authority over that prisoner,
regardless of where the prisoner is incarcerated or supervised. 
Some states were unable to provide counts that distinguish 
between custody and jurisdiction. ***Footnote 5 See Jurisdiction 
notes in Prisoners in 2013, (NCJ 247282, BJS web, September 
2014) to determine which states did not distinguish between 
custody and jurisdiction counts***.

With the exception of appendix table 2, the NPS counts in all 
tables and figures of this report are consistent with the 
jurisdiction counts and findings reported in Prisoners in 2013,
(NCJ 247282, BJS web, September 2014). The jurisdiction counts 
represent BJS’s official measure of the prison population and 
include persons held in prisons, penitentiaries, correctional
facilities, halfway houses, boot camps, farms, training or 
treatment centers, and hospitals. They also include prisoners 
who were temporarily absent (fewer than 30 days), in court, or
on work release; housed in privately operated facilities, local 
jails, or other state or federal facilities; and serving
concurrent sentences for more than one correctional authority.

The NPS custody counts are reported in appendix table 2 and 
include all inmates held within state and federal facilities, 
including inmates housed for other correctional facilities,
prisoners held in privately operated facilities, prisoners age 
17 or younger who were serving time in a state or federal 
correctional facility after being sentenced in criminal court 
as if they were adults (1,200 persons in 2013), and inmates in 
the 6 states in which prisons and jails form one integrated 
system, including inmates age 17 or younger who may have been 
held before or after adjudication.

In 1995, BJS began collecting yearend counts of inmates from 
the departments of corrections in the U.S. territories 
(American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) and U.S.
commonwealths (Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico). These 
data are only included in appendix table 3 of this report and 
represent all inmates under the jurisdiction or legal authority
of prison facilities in the U.S. territories or commonwealths.

Survey of Jails in Indian Country.
***********************************

The Annual Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) has been 
conducted annually since 1998, except in 2005 and 2006. The 
SJIC collects detailed information on all adult and juvenile
confinement facilities, detention centers, jails, and other 
facilities operated by tribal authorities or the U.S.  
Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Indian Affairs.
These data are included in appendix table 3 of this report.

Counts adjusted for offenders 
with multiple correctional statuses
***********************************

Offenders under correctional supervision may have multiple 
correctional statuses for several reasons. For example, 
probation and parole agencies may not always be notified 
immediately of new arrests, jail admissions, or prison 
admissions; absconders included in a probation or parole 
agency’s population in one jurisdiction may actually be 
incarcerated in another jurisdiction; persons may be admitted 
to jail or prison before formal revocation hearings and 
potential discharge by a probation or parole agency; and 
persons may be serving separate probation and parole sentences
concurrently. In addition, state and federal prisons may hold 
inmates in county facilities or local jails to reduce crowding 
in their prisons.

In 1998, through the ASPP, BJS began collecting data on the 
number of probationers and parolees with multiple correctional 
statuses and has since expanded on the information collected. 
In 1999, through the NPS, BJS began collecting data on the 
number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of state or federal 
prisons that were held in county facilities or local jails. 
Table 6 includes adjustments that were made to the total 
correctional population, total community supervision 
population, and total incarcerated population estimates 
presented in this report to exclude offenders with multiple
correctional statuses to avoid double counting offenders.

The estimates from the ASPP are based on data reported by the 
probation and parole agencies that were able to provide the
information within the specific reporting year. Because some 
probation and parole agencies did not provide these data each
year, the numbers may underestimate the total number of 
offenders who had multiple correctional statuses between
2000 and 2013. Due to these adjustments, the sum of 
correctional statuses in tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and appendix 
table 1 will not equal the total correctional population.
In addition, the sum of the probation and parole populations 
for 2008 through 2013 will not yield the total community
supervision population because the total was adjusted for 
parolees who were also on probation.

In addition, the sum of the prison and local jail populations 
for 2000 through 2013 will not equal the total incarcerated
population because prisoners held in local jails were excluded 
from the total.

Decomposing the decline in the
correctional supervision rate
***********************************

To decompose the decline in the
correctional supervision rate discussed
in this report, the following formula
was used:

?R = [P1 * (1/GP1)] – [P0 * (1/GP0)]

= [P1 * ((1/GP1) - (1/GP0))] + [(1/GP0) *(P1 – P0)]

= [(1/GP1) * (P1 – P0)] + [P0 * ((1/GP1)- (1/GP0)]

In this formula, ?R is the change in the correctional  
supervision rate, P1 is the total correctional population for
the most recent year, P0 is the total correctional population 
for the earlier year, GP1 is the U.S. adult resident
population for the most recent year, and GP0 is the U.S. adult 
resident population for the earlier year. The components
[(1/GP0) * (P1 – P0)] and [(1/GP1) * (P1 – P0)] provided the 
change in the correctional supervision rate due to the change 
in the total correctional population. These two components were
summed, and the average was used to estimate the amount of 
change in the correctional supervision rate attributed to the 
change in the total correctional population during that period.

The components [P1 * ((1/GP1) – (1/ GP0))] and [P0 * ((1/GP1) – 
(1/GP0)] provided the change due to the U.S. adult resident 
population. These two components were summed, and the average 
was used to estimate the amount of change in the correctional
supervision rate attributed to the change in the U.S. adult 
resident population during the period.

Adjustments for nonresponse
***********************************

Probation, parole, jail, and prison population counts were 
adjusted to account for nonresponse across the data 
collections. The methods varied and depended on the type of 
collection, type of respondent, and availability of 
information. For more information for 2013, see the following 
reports: Jail Inmates at Midyear 2013 – Statistical Tables, NCJ 
245350, BJS web, May 2014, Prisoners in 2013, NCJ 247282, BJS
web, September 2014, and Probation and Parole in the United 
States, 2013, NCJ 248029, BJS web, October 2014.

The local jail population counts that were collected through 
the 2013 Census of Jails to produce the jurisdiction-level
estimates that are reported in appendix table 1 were adjusted 
for unit and item nonresponse. Nonresponse in the 2013 jail 
census was minimal as the unit response rate was 92.4% and the
item response rate for the December 31, 2013, population total 
was 99.7%. For jails that did not participate in the census or 
were unable to provide the 2013 yearend count, a sequential hot
deck imputation procedure was used to impute values. This 
procedure used respondent (donor) data as a substitute for 
missing values. The donor for each nonrespondent was randomly
selected from within a set of similar jails, which was sorted 
by the previous year population value. The resulting imputed 
values are generally similar to previous year reported values, 
but are not identical due to differences between each donor and 
nonrespondent pair and the year-to-year fluctuation in donor
population values.

The total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of 
correctional authorities in the U.S. territories and 
commonwealths in 2012 and 2013 includes estimates for 
nonresponse (see appendix table 3). Guam did not provide any 
data in 2012; therefore, Guam’s prison population for 2012 was
estimated as the average of its 2011 and 2013 populations, and 
this estimate was included in the U.S. total for 2012. The U.S. 
Virgin Islands provided inconsistent data in 2013, Puerto Rico
provided only partial data (about 4,800 prisoners under their 
jurisdiction), and American Samoa did not provide any data in 
2013. Because of limited information, the U.S. Virgin Islands’
and Puerto Rico’s prison populations in 2012 were used to  
impute their 2013 populations and the estimates were
included in the U.S. total for 2013. American Samoa provided 
data in 2011; therefore, its prison population in 2011 was used 
to impute the prison population in 2012 and 2013. These 
estimates were included in the U.S. totals for 2012 and 2013. 
In addition, the Northern Mariana Islands reported only the 
number of inmates in the custody of their facilities in 2013, 
not the number of inmates under their legal jurisdiction.
The custody prison population was used as an estimate of the 
number of prisoners under their jurisdiction, as the two 
populations have been equal in prior collection years. This 
estimate was included in the U.S. total for 2013.

Estimates of males and females 
under correctional supervision
***********************************

The number of males and the number of females on probation or 
parole were adjusted to account for nonresponse using a ratio 
adjustment method. For jurisdictions that did not provide data 
on sex for a portion of their population, the sex distribution 
of the known portion of the population was used to impute for 
the unknown portion because it was assumed that the 
distributions were the same. For states that were unable to 
provide any data on sex, the state national average was used to 
impute the number of males and females supervised in those 
states. Adjusted jurisdiction totals were then aggregated to 
produce national estimates of the number of males and females 
on probation and parole.

The number of prisoners by sex represents the reported number
of males and females under the jurisdiction of state or federal 
prisons within the reference year. The number of local jail 
inmates by sex represents the adjusted number of males and 
females in the custody of local jails within the reference 
year. (For details describing nonresponse adjustments for 
characteristics of the local jail population, see Jail Inmates 
at Midyear 2013 - Statistical Tables, NCJ 245350, BJS web, May 
2014.)

To generate estimates of the total correctional population by 
sex for 2000, 2010, and 2013, the numbers of males and females 
for all four correctional statuses were aggregated, and the 
totals were adjusted using ratio estimation to account for male 
and female offenders with multiple correctional statuses.
These adjustments were made by correctional status.

To estimate the number of male and female prisoners held in 
local jail, the distribution of the prison population by sex 
within the reference year was applied to the total number of 
prisoners in local jails. The estimated number of female 
prisoners held in local jails was then subtracted from the 
total number of females under correctional supervision. This 
same method was used to adjust the number of males under 
correctional supervision.

To estimate the number of males and females on parole who were 
also on probation in 2010 and 2013, the distribution of the 
parole population by sex within the reference year was applied 
to the total number of parolees on probation. The estimated
number of males with dual community supervision statuses was 
then subtracted from the total number of males under 
correctional supervision. This same method was used to adjust 
the number of females under correctional supervision.

For 2000, 2010, and 2013, the total correctional population 
estimates were adjusted to account for the number of males and 
females on probation who were held in prisons or local jails 
and the number of males and females on parole who were held in 
prisons or local jails. The distribution of the local jail 
population by sex was applied to the total number of 
probationers in local jails within the reference year to 
estimate the number of males and females with both correctional 
statuses. In addition, the distribution of the prison 
population by sex was applied to the total number of 
probationers in prison within the reference year to estimate 
the number of males and females with both correctional 
statuses. The estimated number of male probationers in prisons 
and local jails was then subtracted from the total number of 
males under correctional supervision within the reference year, 
and this same method was used to adjust the number of females 
under correctional supervision. This method was also employed 
to account for parolees in prisons or local jails, and the 
totals, by sex, were excluded from the number of males and 
females under correctional supervision.
