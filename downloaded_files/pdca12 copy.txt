Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003
PREA Data Collection Activities, 2012

The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA; P.L. 108-
79) requires the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to 
carry out, for each calendar year, a comprehensive statistical 
review and analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape. 
The Act further specifies that the review and analysis shall 
be based on a random sample, or other scientifically appropriate 
sample of not less than 10 percent of all prisons, and a 
representative sample of municipal prisons. In 2011, more than 
7,600 correctional facilities nationwide were covered by the Act. 
The Act requires the Attorney General to submit a report, not 
later than June 30 of each year, listing institutions in the 
sample and ranking them according to the incidence of prison 
rape. BJS has developed a multiple-measure, multiple-mode data 
collection strategy to fully implement requirements under PREA.

Data Collections During 2011 and 2012

National Former Prisoner Survey (NFPS) provided the
first-ever national estimates of the prevalence of sexual
victimization based on reports of former state prison inmates. 
The report, Sexual Victimization Reported by Former State 
Prisoners, 2008, was released in May 2012. It was based on 
18,526 completed interviews with former inmates under active 
supervision in 333 randomly selected parole offices nationwide.

Unlike previous BJS surveys of inmates in state and federal 
correctional facilities, the NFPS collected data on the totality 
of the prior term of incarceration, including any time in a local 
jail, state prison, or community correctional facility prior 
to final discharge. Because the survey was based on a sample 
of parole offices and not a sample of prisons, the NFPS was 
not conducive to providing facility estimates or rankings.

The NFPS was designed to encourage a fuller reporting of
victimization by surveying only former inmates, who were 
not subject to the immediate risk of retaliation from 
perpetrators or a code of silence while in prison. As a 
result, the NFPS may have elicited reports of incidents that 
were unreported in previous BJS surveys of prisoners. At the 
same time, the NFPS collects only allegations of sexual 
victimization, and some allegations may be untrue. Because 
participation in the survey is anonymous and reports are 
confidential, the survey does not permit any follow-up 
investigation or substantiation of reported incidents 
through review. The relative extent of under reporting 
and false reporting in the NFPS is unknown.

The NFPS interviews, which averaged 23 minutes in
length, were conducted using computer-assisted personal
interviewing (CAPI) and audio computer-assisted self-
interviewing (ACASI) data collection methods. Survey 
interviewers initiated the personal interview using CAPI 
to obtain demographic and criminal history information. 
For the remainder of the interview, respondents interacted 
with a computer-administered questionnaire using a touch-screen 
and synchronized audio instructions delivered via headphones. 
Respondents completed the survey in private at the parole 
office (or satellite office), with the interviewer in the 
room but unable to see the computer screen.

Among the findings--

*An estimated 9.6% of former state prisoners reported one
or more incidents of sexual victimization during the most
recent period of incarceration in a jail, prison, and post-
release community-treatment facility.

*Among all former state prisoners, 1.8% reported
experiencing one or more incidents while in a local jail,
7.5% while in a state prison, and 0.1% while in a post-release 
community-treatment facility.

*Although the rate of sexual victimization in state prison 
reported by former inmates (7.5%) was higher than the rate 
reported by inmates in previous BJS surveys (4.8% in 2008-09), 
the difference may reflect longer exposure periods 
(39.4 months and 7.9 months, respectively).

*About 5.4% of former state prisoners reported an incident 
involving another inmate, and 5.3% reported an incident 
involving facility staff.

*An estimated 1.2% of former prisoners reported that they
unwillingly had sex or sexual contact with facility staff, 
and 4.6% reported that they “willingly” had sex or sexual 
contact with staff.

*More than three-quarters of all reported staff sexual
misconduct involved a male inmate with female staff.

*Among former state prisoners, the rate of inmate-on 
inmate sexual victimization was at least three times 
higher for females (13.7%) than males (4.2%).

*Among heterosexual males, an estimated 3.5% reported
being sexually victimized by another inmate. In comparison, 
among males who were bisexual, 34% reported being sexually 
victimized by another inmate. Among males who were homosexual 
or gay, 39% reported being victimized by another inmate.

*Rates of sexual victimization did not vary based on
commonly cited characteristics of facilities, including
size or age of facility, crowding, inmate-to-staff ratios, 
or gender composition of staff.

*Among male former inmates, inmate-on-inmate and
staff-on-inmate victimization rates were higher in
facilities under a court order or consent decree, in
facilities reporting a major disturbance in the 12 months
prior to the most recent facility census, in facilities 
with medium or greater security levels, and in facilities 
with a primary function of housing general population than 
rates in facilities without these characteristics.

*Among female former inmates, rates of inmate-on-
inmate victimization were lower in community corrections 
centers, in facilities that permitted 50% or more of their 
inmates to leave unaccompanied during the day, in minimum 
or low security facilities, and in privately operated 
facilities than in facilities without these characteristics.

*Following their release from prison, 72% of victims of
inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization indicated they
felt shame or humiliation, and 56% said they felt guilt.
Seventy-nine percent of unwilling victims of staff sexual
misconduct said they felt shame or humiliation, and 72%
said they felt guilt.

National Survey of Youth in Custody (NSYC) provides
facility-level estimates of youth reporting sexual
victimization in juvenile facilities. The first NSYC (NSYC-1) 
was conducted between June 2008 and April 2009. The report, 
Sexual Victimization in Juvenile Facilities Reported by Youth, 
2008-09, was released in January 2010. It was based on 9,198 
completed interviews with adjudicated youth in 166 state 
facilities and 29 large locally or privately operated 
facilities.

The second collection (NSYC-2) is underway and will
be completed by September 2012. Based on feedback
from juvenile administrators and experts in investigating
allegations of child abuse and neglect, BJS modified the
survey. NSYC-2 included new items to measure the accuracy
of youth self-reports and new items to more fully understand 
staff sexual misconduct. BJS also developed methods to enhance 
response rates and expanded the sample to include youth held in 
smaller facilities and facilities under contract to state juvenile 
correctional authorities. Another new component of NSYC-2 is the 
collection of information about each facility and living unit. 
NSYC-2 will collect data on facility staffing, use of video 
surveillance, characteristics of youth held, and factors 
related to placement of youth in different living units 
within the facility.

Field operations for the NSYC-2, including recruitment,
Institutional Review Board processing, and site visit
planning, began in July 2011. Interviewing of youth began 
in February 2012.

When the data collection is completed, BJS expects to have 
conducted more than 11,000 interviews in 338 juvenile 
facilities. NSYC-2 will provide national estimates, 
facility-level estimates for large facilities, 
and state-level estimates.

National Inmate Survey (NIS) gathers data on the
prevalence and incidence of sexual assault in adult 
prisons and local jail facilities, as reported by inmates. 
The inmates use ACASI technology with a laptop touch screen 
and an audio feed to maximize inmate confidentiality and minimize 
literacy issues. The first NIS (NIS-1) was conducted in 2007, 
producing two reports: Sexual Victimization in State and Federal 
Prisons Reported by Inmates, 2007 and Sexual Victimization in 
Local Jails Reported by Inmates, 2007. The second NIS (NIS-2) 
was conducted between October 2008 and December 2009, producing 
a combined prison and jail report: Sexual Victimization in 
Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2008-09.

NIS-2 was conducted in 167 state and federal prisons, 286
local jails, and 10 special correctional facilities (operated 
by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Indian tribes, 
or the U.S. Armed Services). A total of 81,566 inmates 
participated in the survey, including 32,029 prison inmates, 
48,066 jail inmates, 957 ICE detainees, 399 inmates in 
facilities operated by the U.S. Armed Services, and 115 
inmates in Indian country facilities.

Rates of alleged sexual victimization were unchanged
between NIS-1 and NIS-2. In NIS-2, an estimated 4.4%
of prison inmates and 3.1% of jail inmates reported
experiencing one or more incidents of sexual victimization 
by another inmate or facility staff in the past 12 months 
or since admission to the facility, if less than 12 months. 
In NIS-1, 4.5% of prisoners and 3.2% of jail inmates 
reported having been sexually victimized.

BJS used the NIS-2 to provide more in-depth analyses of
different types of victimization, inmate risk factors, 
and circumstances surrounding victimization. To address 
PREA requirements, BJS identified facilities as having high 
or low rates based on each type of victimization, and 
statistical criteria applied to the lower and upper 
bounds of confidence intervals associated with the 
survey estimates.

Data collection for the third NIS collection (NIS-3) was
completed in May 2012. BJS modified the survey design
to provide the first national-level estimates of sexual
victimization for inmates under age 18 in prisons and jails. 
The survey was also modified to include measures of mental 
and physical health, as well as indicators of facility safety 
and security. The first NIS-3 report, expected in January 2013, 
will provide facility estimates and rankings as required 
under PREA.

Survey of Sexual Violence (SSV) collects data annually
on the incidence of sexual violence in adult and juvenile
correctional facilities. This administrative records 
collection, the first of a series of data collections 
implemented to meet PREA mandates, began in 2004. 
The surveys include measures of four different types 
of sexual victimization, and it is administered to 
a sample of at least 10% of all correctional facilities 
covered under the Act. Additional detail is collected 
on the characteristics of substantiated incidents of 
sexual violence.

The administrative records surveys provide a basis for
the annual statistical review required under the Act. The
surveys include all federal and state prison systems, as
well as facilities operated by the U.S. Armed Services 
and ICE. The surveys also include representative samples 
of jail jurisdictions, privately operated adult prisons 
and jails, and jails in Indian country. Each year the 
SSV also includes all state operated juvenile facilities 
and a representative sample of locally and privately 
operated juvenile facilities.

The report, Sexual Victimization Reported by Adult
Correctional Authorities, 2007-2008, was released 
in January 2011. Results from the SSV for juvenile 
facilities are expected in October 2012 and from 
the SSV for adult facilities in December 2012.

Clinical Indicators of Sexual Violence in Custody (CISVC)
was conducted during 2010 and 2011. In collaboration with
the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), BJS conducted
a feasibility study using medical indicators and medical
surveillance methodologies. As part of routine medical
practice, medical staff in 19 prisons and 11 jails 
completed a surveillance form for adult male inmates 
who either made an allegation of sexual violence or 
displayed any of five clinical conditions (i.e., unexplained 
rectal bleeding; rectal or anal tears or fissures; bruises, 
scratches, or abrasions on buttocks; genital bruising; 
or nipple injuries). Data collected in the CISVC include 
victim age, height, weight, and race/Hispanic origin; 
a general injury assessment; a mental health assessment; 
and follow-up information. Results of the 12-month 
pilot study are expected in 2012.
