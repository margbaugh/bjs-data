---------------------------------------------------

In 2007, federal, state, and local governments spent $228
billion and employed 2.5 million persons for police
protection, corrections, and judicial and legal services
(figures 1 and 2). Local police protection represented the
largest share of both total justice expenditures (32%) and
employment (36%), followed by state corrections (19% of
expenditures and employment).

The findings in this report are based on the Bureau of
Justice Statistics' (BJS) Justice Expenditure and Employment
Extracts (JEE) series, based on data from the U.S. Census
Bureau's Government Finance Survey and Annual Survey of
Public Employment. The data include yearly information on
federal, state, and local government expenditures and
employment for three justice functions: corrections, police
protection, and judicial and legal services (for definition
of terms, see page 9). Expenditure data are presented in real
terms (see Methodology for more details). Extract tables from
this series are accessible on the BJS website.

This report presents trend data in 5-year increments from
1982 to 2007 on direct justice expenditures.
Intergovernmental expenditures, the sum of payments made from
one government entity to another, appear as direct
expenditures when the receiving government purchases goods or
services with the funds (see Methodology for further
explanation).

Direct expenditures, by justice function and level of
government

* During 2007, the cost of the nation's police protection,
corrections, and judicial and legal services was $228
billion, an increase of 171% since 1982, after adjusting for
inflation. Between 2002 and 2007, public expenditures for
criminal and civil justice remained flat (table 1).

* Between 1982 and 2002, federal expenditures increased
276%; state, 208%; and local, 132%, after adjusting for
inflation. Between 2002 and 2007, federal expenditures
increased 7% and local expenditures increased 1%, while
state expenditures declined 5%.

* Federal expenditures increased from 11% of total
expenditures to 16% between 1982 and 2007, while
state expenditures increased from 30% to 33%, and
local expenditures declined from 59% to 51% of total
expenditures during this same period.

* Between 1982 and 2002, after adjusting for inflation,
judicial and legal services expenditures increased 182%;
police protection, 126%; and corrections, 255%. Between
2002 and 2007, judicial and legal services expenditures
declined 3% and corrections declined 2%, while police
protection expenditures increased 3% (table 2).

* Judicial and legal services spending remained at 22% of
total expenditures in 1982 and 2007, varying slightly over
this time. During this same period, police protection
declined from 53% to 46%, and corrections increased
from 25% to 33%.

* Across all levels of government and justice functions,
local police protection and state corrections expenditures
were the largest components of justice spending between 1982
and 2007. Local police protection expenditures fell from
40% of total spending in 1982 to 32% in 2007, while state
corrections increased from 16% in 1982 to 21% in 1997
and then decreased to 19% in 2007 (not shown in table).

* In 1982, local governments supplied about half (49%) of
total judicial and legal services funding; by 2007, local
(40%) and state (38%) governments contributed about the
same percentage of total judicial and legal services funding
(table 3).

* The federal government contributed about a fifth of total
expenditures on judicial and legal services both in 2007
(22%) and 1982 (16%).

* Most police protection expenditures were at the local
level, 75% in 1982 and 70% in 2007, while federal government
spending on police protection increased from 11% to
19% during this same period. State spending on police
protection was stable from 1982 to 2007, comprising
between 11% and 13% of total spending (table 4).

* Corrections expenditures were concentrated primarily
at the state level, varying slightly between 59% and 63%
from 1982 to 2007 (table 5).

* From 1982 to 2007, local corrections expenditures varied
between 30% and 34% of total corrections spending while
federal spending varied between 5% and 9% during this
same period.

Per capita expenditures

* Per capita justice expenditures totaled $755 per U.S.
resident in 2007, a decline of 5% from the inflation
adjusted 2002 peak of $791 per resident (table 6).

* In 2007, per capita expenditures were highest for police
protection ($344), followed by corrections ($246) and
judicial and legal services ($165).

* Between 2002 and 2007, per capita expenditures fell the
most for judicial and legal services (-7%) and corrections
(-7%), followed by police protection (-2%).

Employment, by justice function and level of government

* In 2007, a total of 2.5 million persons were employed in
the nation's justice system, an increase of 93% from 1982,
when 1.3 million persons were employed (table 7).

* Between 1982 and 2002, federal justice system
employment increased 115%; state, 118%; and local,
63%. Between 2002 and 2007, federal justice system
employment increased 30%; state, 3%; and local, 5%.

* Federal employment increased from 7% of total justice
employment in 1982 to 11% in 2007, while state
employment increased from 27% to 31%, and local
employment declined from 66% to 58% during this same
period.

* Between 1982 and 2002, employment for judicial and
legal services increased 97%; police protection, 47%;
and corrections, 151%. Between 2002 and 2007, judicial
and legal services employment increased 4%; police
protection, 9%; and corrections, 4% (table 8).

* As a percentage of total justice employment, judicial and
legal services held steady, comprising 20% of total justice
employment in 1982 and 21% in 2007. During this same
period, police protection employment declined from
57% to 48% of total justice employment, and corrections
employment increased from 24% to 32%.

* Across all levels of government and justice functions,
local police protection employment and state
corrections employment had the greatest percentage
of justice employees between 1982 and 2007. Local
police protection employment fell from 47% of total
justice employment in 1982 to 36% in 2007, while state
corrections employment increased from 15% to 22%
between 1982 and 1997, and declined to 19% in 2007
(not shown in table).

* Between 1982 and 2007, over half (53% to 57%) of judicial
and legal services employees worked at the local level,
about a third (30% to 35%) worked at the state level, and
11% to 14% worked at the federal level (table 9).

* Between 1982 and 2007, about two-thirds (61% to 65%)
of corrections employees worked at the state level, about
a third (31% to 35%) worked at the local level, and 3% to
5% worked at the federal level (table 10).

* Over three-quarters (76% to 82%) of police protection
employees worked at the local level between 1982 and
2007. During this same period, 9% to 11% worked at
the state level, and 8% to 14% worked at the federal level
(table 11).

Employment rate

* The justice employment rate increased from 5.5
employees per 1,000 U.S. residents in 1982 to 8.1 in 2001.
This rate held steady between 2002 and 2007 (table 12).

* Across justice functions in 2007, the employment rate
for police protection was the highest (3.9 per 1,000 U.S.
residents), followed by corrections (2.6 per 1,000) and
judicial and legal services (1.7 per 1,000).

Definition of Terms

Expenditures include only external cash payments made
from any source of funds, including any payments financed
from borrowing, fund balances, intergovernmental
revenue, and other current revenue. It excludes any
intragovernmental transfers and noncash transactions,
such as the provision of meals or housing of employees. It
also excludes retirement of debt, investment in securities,
extensions of loans, or agency transactions.

Direct expenditures are all expenditures except those
classified as intergovernmental. It includes direct current
expenditures (e.g., salaries, wages, fees, and commissions
and purchases of supplies, materials, and contractual
services) and capital outlays (e.g., construction and
purchase of equipment, land, and existing structures). Note
that capital outlays are included for the year in which the
direct expenditure is made, regardless of how the funds are
raised (e.g., bond issue) or when they are paid back.

Intergovernmental transfers are the sum of payments made
from one government entity to another, including grants-in
aid, shared revenues, payments in lieu of taxes, and amounts
for services performed by one government for another on a
reimbursable or cost-sharing basis (e.g., payments by one
government to another for boarding prisoners). It excludes
amounts paid to other governments for purchase of
commodities, property, or utility services.

Employees are all persons on government payrolls during
the pay period including March 15, 2007. They include all
paid officials and persons on paid leave, but exclude unpaid
officials, persons on unpaid leave, pensioners, and
contractors.

Police protection is the justice function of enforcing
the law, preserving order, and apprehending those who
violate the law, whether these activities are performed
by a city police department, sheriffs' office, state police,
or federal law enforcement agency such as the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA). Private security police are outside
the scope of the survey.

Judicial and legal services include all civil and criminal
courts and activities associated with courts such as law
libraries, grand juries, petit juries, court reporters,
judicial councils, bailiffs, and probate functions. It also
includes the civil and criminal justice activities of the
attorneys general, district attorneys, state's attorneys, and
their variously named equivalents and corporate counsels,
solicitors, and legal departments with various names. It
excludes legal units of noncriminal justice agencies, whose
functions may be performed by legal services departments in
other jurisdictions (e.g., a county counsel).

Corrections involves the community supervision, confinement,
and rehabilitation of adults and juveniles convicted of
offenses and the confinement of persons awaiting trial or
adjudication. It includes the costs of operation and
employment for jails, prisons, probation and parole offices,
pardon proceedings, and correctional administrations. Data
for institutions with authority to hold prisoners beyond
arraignment (usually 48 hours or more) are included in this
definition.

Methodology 

The Justice Expenditure and Employment Extracts (JEE) series
is an annual data collection published by the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS). Data presented are extracted from
the U.S. Census Bureau's Government Finance Survey and Annual
Survey of Public Employment. This report includes federal,
state, and local (e.g., city, county, municipal, and
township) government direct expenditures and employment for
three justice functions: police protection, corrections, and
judicial and legal services.

Intergovernmental transfers are excluded to avoid the
inflation of expenditures that would result from the adding
of intergovernmental transfers plus the direct expenditure
of the funds by the recipient government. In addition,
intergovernmental transfers themselves may be duplicated.
The federal government may transfer money to a state, which
then divides that money among localities, causing duplication
in the counting of intergovernmental transfers. This also
makes it difficult to determine the original source of the
intergovernmental transfer. Funds received through
intergovernmental transfers are ultimately captured in the
receiving government's direct expenditures.

Data collection

This report includes data in 5-year increments from 1982 to
2007. Data were obtained for the federal government, every
state government, and all local governments. Beginning in
1997, expenditure data for the federal government were
obtained from the Budget of the United States Government
using the definitions contained in the federal budget. Prior
to 1997, the U.S. Census Bureau compiled expenditures from
the federal budget according to Census definitions. Federal
government employment data were obtained from the U.S.
Office of Personnel Management records.

Expenditures for state as well as local large county and
city governments were compiled by U.S. Census Bureau
representatives from government audits, budgets, and other
financial reports with the advice of state and local officers
10 Justice Expenditures and Employment, 1982-2007 -
Statistical Tables and employees. The information from these
reports was then placed into expenditure categories using the
U.S. Census Bureau's classification system. The data were
verified with government officials before being released.
Data from other localities were collected from state central
collections and through mail surveys to local governments.
State and local employment data were collected through a mail
survey of all state and local departments, agencies, and
institutions. The Government Finance Survey is available on
the U.S. Census Bureau's website at 
http://www.census.gov/govs/.

Response rates, imputation, and standard errors

The response rates for localities are presented in the
methodology sections of each year's collection, available
on the BJS website. Prior to 1994, the U.S. Census Bureau
imputed data of nonresponding jurisdictions from previous
years' data to estimate national, state, and local totals.
From 1994 to 2007, the U.S. Census Bureau imputed data from
similar nonresponding jurisdictions to estimate national,
state, and local totals.

Other BJS employment and expenditure collections 

The data here differ from other BJS series, which also
collect agency-based employment and expenditure data, due to
different units of analysis and data collection purposes.
All other collections provide more detailed employment data
with a more narrow scope than the JEE. Some other collections
also include expenditure data with varying levels
of detail. These include-

* The Law Enforcement Management and Administrative
Statistics (LEMAS), which collects operating expenditure
data and the number of sworn and civilian personnel
for law enforcement agencies. Unlike the JEE, LEMAS
classifies expenditures and employment by type of agency
as opposed to function. For example, transit police for
a transportation agency are coded as transportation
personnel in LEMAS but as police protection personnel
in the JEE. Further discussion of LEMAS is accessible
on the BJS website at http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.
cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=248.

* ..The National Census of State Court Prosecutors (NCSP),
which collects employment and expenditure data on
prosecutors' offices in state court systems. It provides
detail on the number and type of staff in prosecutors'
offices, including number and types of prosecutors and
number of other staff such as investigators and victim
advocates. It also includes data on the annual budget of
the office and the annual salary of the chief prosecutor.
The data it provides are a subset of the judicial and legal
services function in the JEE collection. Further discussion
of the NCSP is accessible on the BJS website at http://bjs.
gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=265.

* The Census of Jail Facilities (CJF), which provides
the number of full- and part-time employees on the
government payroll in responding jail jurisdictions. It
includes the number and demographic characteristics
of correctional officers and the number of other types
of personnel such as administrators, professional and
technical staff, clerical and maintenance staff, and
educational staff. Operating costs collected by the CJF
include total salaries, wages, benefits, and other operating
expenditures. Capital expenditures for jail jurisdictions
include construction costs; equipment, such as vehicles,
furnishings, and computers; and other capital costs, such
as the purchase of land. Further discussion of the CJF
is accessible on the BJS website at http://bjs.gov/index.
cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=254.

* The Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional
Facilities, which contains the same detail on the number
and types of personnel as the CJF but it lacks expenditure
data. Further discussion is accessible on the BJS website at
http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=255.

Adjusting for Inflation

Government expenditures for fiscal years preceding 2007 were
inflation adjusted to 2007 constant dollars, as appropriate
for state and local government spending and nondefense
federal spending. Annual chain-type price indices for gross
domestic product were employed as divisors and unadjusted
expenditures were employed as dividends to produce inflation
adjusted expenditures in 2007 constant dollars.

The U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Economic
Analysis, developed the price indices used in all inflation
adjustments, as published in the Economic Report of the
President. For more information on price indices, see the
Economic Report of the President (2009), Table B-7. Chaintype
price indexes for gross domestic product, 1959-2008,
U.S. Government Printing Office, retrieved from http://www.
gpoaccess.gov/eop/tables09.html.

Below is a comparison of total justice expenditures in
nominal dollars (before adjusting for inflation) and real
dollars (after adjusting for inflation).
