Introduction and highlights
    
Introduction

In 1994, prisons in 15 States released 9,691 male sex offenders. 
The 9,691 men are two-thirds of all the male sex offenders 
released from State prisons in the United States in 1994. This 
report summarizes findings from a survey that tracked the 9,691 
for 3 full years after their release. The report documents their 
"recidivism," as measured by rates of rearrest, reconviction, 
and reimprisonment during the 3-year followup period.

This report gives recidivism rates for the 9,691 combined total. 
It also separates the 9,691 into four overlapping categories and 
gives recidivism rates for each category:

*  3,115 released rapists
*  6,576 released sexual assaulters
*  4,295 released child molesters
*  443 released statutory rapists.

The 9,691 sex offenders were released from State prisons in these 
15 States: Arizona, Maryland, North Carolina, California, Michigan, 
Ohio, Delaware, Minnesota, Oregon, Florida, New Jersey, Texas, 
Illinois, New York, and Virginia. 

Highlights

The 15 States in the study released 272,111 prisoners altogether 
in 1994.  Among the 272,111 were 9,691 men whose crime was a sex 
offense (3.6% of releases).

On average the 9,691 sex offenders served 31/2 years of their 8-
year sentence (45% of the prison sentence) before being released 
in 1994.

Rearrest for a new sex crime

Compared to non-sex offenders released from State prisons, released 
sex offenders were 4 times more likely to be rearrested for a sex
crime.  Within the first 3 years following their release from prison 
in 1994, 5.3% (517 of the 9,691) of released sex offenders were
rearrested for a sex crime. The rate for the 262,420 released non-
sex offenders was lower, 1.3% (3,328 of 262,420). 

The first 12 months following their release from a State prison was 
the period when 40% of sex crimes were allegedly committed by the
released sex offenders.

Recidivism studies typically find that, the older the prisoner when 
released, the lower the rate of recidivism.  Results reported here 
on released sex offenders did not follow the familiar pattern. While 
the lowest rate of rearrest for a sex crime (3.3%) did belong to the 
oldest sex offenders (those age 45 or older), other comparisons 
between older and younger prisoners did not consistently show older
prisoners' having the lower rearrest rate.

The study compared recidivism rates among prisoners who served 
different lengths of time before being released from prison in 
1994. No clear association was found between how long they were 
in prison and their recidivism rate.

Before being released from prison in 1994, most of the sex offenders 
had been arrested several times for different types of crimes. The 
more prior arrests they had, the greater their likelihood of being 
rearrested for another sex crime after leaving prison. Released sex
offenders with 1 prior arrest (the arrest for the sex crime for which 
they were imprisoned) had the lowest rearrest rate for a sex crime, 
about 3%; those with 2 or 3 prior arrests for some type of crime, 
4%; 4 to 6 prior arrests, 6%; 7 to 10 prior arrests, 7%; and 11 to 
15 prior arrests, 8%.

Rearrest for a sex crime against a child

The 9,691 released sex offenders included 4,295 men who were in 
prison for child molesting.

Of the children these 4,295 men were imprisoned for molesting, 60% 
were age 13 or younger.

Half of the 4,295 child molesters were 20 or more years older than 
the child they were imprisoned for molesting.

On average, the 4,295 child molesters were released after serving 
about 3 years of their 7-year sentence (43% of the prison sentence).

Compared to the 9,691 sex offenders and to the 262,420 non-sex 
offenders, released child molesters were more likely to be 
rearrested for child molesting. Within the first 3 years following
release from prison in 1994, 3.3% (141 of 4,295) of released child 
molesters were rearrested for another sex crime against a child.
The rate for all 9,691 sex offenders (a category that includes the 
4,295 child molesters) was 2.2% (209 of 9,691). The rate for all 
262,420 non-sex offenders was less than half of 1% (1,042 of the 
262,420).

Of the approximately 141 children allegedly molested by the child 
molesters after their release from prison in 1994, 79% were age 13
or younger.

Released child molesters with more than 1 prior arrest for child 
molesting were more likely to be rearrested for child molesting 
(7.3%) than released child molesters with no more than 1 such 
prior arrest (2.4%).

Rearrest for any type of crime

Compared to non-sex offenders released from State prison, sex 
offenders had a lower overall rearrest rate. When rearrests for 
any type of crime (not just sex crimes) were counted, the study 
found that 43% (4,163 of 9,691) of the 9,691 released sex offenders 
were rearrested. The overall rearrest rate for the 262,420
released non-sex offenders was higher, 68% (179,391 of 262,420).

The rearrest offense was a felony for about 75% of the 4,163 
rearrested sex offenders. By comparison, 84% of the 179,391 
rearrested non-sex offenders were charged by police with a 
felony.

Reconviction for a new sex crime

Of the 9,691 released sex offenders, 3.5% (339 of the 9,691) were 
reconvicted for a sex crime within the 3-year followup period. 

Reconviction for any type of crime

Of the 9,691 released sex offenders, 24% (2,326 of the 9,691) were 
reconvicted for a new offense. The reconviction offense included all
types of crimes.

Returned to prison for any reason

Within 3 years following their release, 38.6% (3,741) of the 9,691 
released sex offenders were returned to prison. They were returned
either because they received another prison sentence for a new 
crime, or because of a technical violation of their parole, such 
as failing a drug test, missing an appointment with their parole 
officer, or being arrested for another crime.

Denfinitions

Imprisonment offense  The 9,691 prisoners were men released from 
State prisons in 1994 after serving some portion of the sentence 
they received for committing a sex crime. The sex crime they 
committed is referred to throughout the report as their 
"imprisonment offense." Their imprisonment offense should not be 
confused with any new offense they may have committed after 
release.

Sex offender  The 9,691 released men were all violent sex offenders. 
They are called "violent" because the crimes they were imprisoned 
for are widely defined in State statutes as "violent" sex offenses. 
"Violent" means the offender used or threatened force in the 
commission of the crime or, while not actually using force, the 
offender did not have the victim's "factual" or "legal" consent.
Factual consent means that, for physical reasons, the victim did 
not give consent, such as when the offender had intercourse with a 
sedated hospital patient or with a woman who had fallen unconscious 
from excessive drug taking. "Legal" consent means that the victim 
willingly participated but, in the eyes of the law, the victim was 
not old enough or not sufficiently mentally capable (perhaps due 
to mental illness or mental retardation) to give his or her "legal" 
consent.

State statutes give many different names to violent sex offenses: 
"forcible rape," "statutory rape," "object rape," "sexual assault," 
"sexual abuse," "forcible sodomy," "sexual misconduct," "criminal 
sexual conduct," "lascivious conduct," "carnal abuse," "sexual 
contact," "unlawful sexual intercourse," "sexual battery," "unlawful 
sexual activity," "lewd act with minor," "indecent liberties with a 
child," "carnal knowledge of a child," "incest with a minor," and 
"child molesting."

"Violent" sex offenses are distinguished from "nonviolent" sex 
offenses and from "commercialized sex offenses." Nonviolent sex
offenses include morals and decency offenses (for example, indecent 
exposure and peeping tom), bestiality and other unnatural acts, 
adultery, incest between adults, and bigamy.  Commercialized sexual 
offenses include prostitution, pimping, and pornography. As used
throughout this report, the terms "sex crimes" and "sex offenders" 
refer exclusively to violent sex offenses.

Each of the 9,691 sex offenders in this report is classified as 
either a rapist or a sexual assaulter. Classification was based on 
information about the imprisonment offense contained in prison 
records supplied for each sex offender released from prison in 1994. 
Also based on imprisonment offense information, an inmate could be
categorized as a child molester and/or a statutory rapist. 
Classification to either of these two categories is in addition to, 
not separate from, classification as a rapist or sexual assaulter. 
For example, of the 3,115 sex offenders classified as rapists, 338 
were child molesters. Or, to put it another way, the imprisonment 
offense for 338 of the 4,295 child molesters identified in this 
report was rape. Similarly, 3,957 of the 4,295 child molesters were 
also sexual assaulters. 

The report gives statistics for all sex offenders and each of the 
four types -- rapists, sexual assaulters, child molesters, and 
statutory rapists. (See Methodology on page 37 for details on how
sex offenders were separated into categories.)

Rapist "Violent sex crimes" are separated into two categories: 
"rape" (short for "forcible rape") and "other sexual assault." As 
used throughout this report the term "rapist" refers to a released 
sex offender whose imprisonment offense was defined by State law as 
forcible intercourse (vaginal, anal, or oral) with a female or male.
Rape includes "forcible sodomy" and "penetration with a foreign 
object." Rape excludes statutory rape or any other nonforcible 
sexual act with a minor or with someone unable to give legal or
factual consent. As used throughout this report, "rape" always 
means "forcible rape." "Statutory rape" is not a type of forcible 
rape.

A total of 3,115 sex offenders are identified in the report as 
released rapists -- about a third (32%) of the 9,691 released sex 
offenders. However, enough information to clearly distinguish 
rapists from other sexual assaulters was not always available in 
the prison records used to categorize sex offenders into different 
types. Consequently, the number of rapists among the 9,691 was
almost certainly greater than 3,115; how much greater is unknown.

An obstacle to identifying rapists from penal code information 
is that the label "rape" is not used in about half the 50 States.  
However, released sex offenders whose imprisonment offense was 
rape could still be identified. To illustrate, in one State,
the term criminal sexual conduct refers to all types of sex 
crimes. The statutory language was consulted to determine if an 
offender's imprisonment offense involved "intercourse" that was 
"forcible," in accordance with the definition of rape used in this 
report. If the offense was not found to involve intercourse (or 
penetration), then the inmate was not classified as a rapist. The
same was true of force; if the statutory language did not include 
a reference to force (or coercion), the offense was not categorized 
as rape.

Sexual assaulter  By definition in the report, all sex offenders 
are either "rapists" or "sexual assaulters." Sex offenders whose 
imprisonment offense could not be positively identified as "rape"
were placed in the "sexual assault" category. To the extent that 
rapists were reliably distinguished from sexual assaulters, 
"sexual assaulters" identified in this report were released sex
offenders whose imprisonment offense was 'sexual assault," 
defined as one of the following: 1. forcible sexual acts, not
amounting to intercourse, with a victim of any age, 2. nonforcible 
sexual acts with a minor (such as statutory rape or incest with a 
minor or fondling), or 3. nonforcible sexual acts with someone 
unable to give legal or factual consent because of mental or 
physical reasons (for example, a mentally ill or retarded person 
or a sedated hospital patient). 

A total of 6,576 sex offenders are identified in this report as 
released sexual assaulters. The 6,576 sexual assaulters made up 
about two-thirds (68%) of the 9,691 released sex offenders. 

Child molester  Many of the 9,691 sex offenders were released 
prisoners whose imprisonment offense was the rape or sexual 
assault of a child.  Throughout the report, released sex 
offenders whose forcible or nonforcible sex crime was against a 
child are referred to as "child molesters." The sex crime did not 
have to involve intercourse to fit the definition of child 
molestation.

Of the 9,691 sex offenders, 4,295 were identified as child 
molesters based on prison records made available for the study. 
However, because complete information was not always supplied,
not every child molester could be identified. Of the 9,691 
released sex offenders, undoubtedly more than 4,295 were child 
molesters, but 4,295 represent all who could be identified from 
the information available. One reason child molesters were not 
easily identified from penal code information is that most States 
do not use the term "child molester" in their penal code. 
Nevertheless, all States have laws against sexual activity with 
children, which does facilitate identification. As a result of 
the uncertainty regarding the number of child molesters among the 
9,691 sex offenders, the study cannot say what percentage of the 
victims of the 9,691 sex offenders' offenses were children, and 
what percentage were adults.

In short, the 4,295 released child molesters in
this report were men who -- 
a. had forcible intercourse  with a child or
b. committed "statutory rape"(meaning nonforcible intercourse 
with a child)or 
c. with or without force, engaged in any other type of sexual 
contact with a child.
Of the 4,295, at least 338 (about 8%) had forcible intercourse, 
and at least 443 (10%)committed statutory rape.

Statutory rapist  State laws define various circumstances in which 
intercourse between consenting partners is illegal: for example, 
when one of the partners is married or when the two are blood 
relatives or when one is a "child."  Laws that criminalize 
consensual intercourse based solely on the marital status of the
partners are called "adultery laws." Those that criminalize it 
based solely on blood relationship are "incest laws." Laws that 
prohibit consensual sexual intercourse based solely on the ages 
of the partners are called "statutory rape laws."

Statutory rape pertains exclusively to consensual intercourse, 
as opposed to other types of sexual contact with a child, such 
as forcible intercourse, forcible fondling, or consensual 
fondling. Statutory rape is one specific form of what this study 
calls "child molestation." The child victim of statutory rape
can be male or female, and the offender can be male or female. 
The offender can be almost any relative ("statutory rape" includes 
incest with a child), an unrelated person well known to the child 
(such as a school teacher, neighbor, or minister), someone the 
child hardly knows, or a stranger.

Statutory rape laws define a "child" as a person who is below 
the "age of consent," meaning below the minimum age at which 
a person can legally consent to having intercourse. Age of
consent in the 50 States ranges from 14 to 18. Most States set 
age of consent at 16. In those States, consensual intercourse 
with someone age 16 or older is usually not a criminal offense,
but intercourse with someone below 16 generally is. However, 
all States make exceptions to their age rules. Consequently,
consensual intercourse with children below the age of consent 
is not always a crime, and consensual intercourse with children 
who are old enough to give consent is not always legally
permissible.

Exceptions for children below age of consent Certain statutory 
exceptions exist to legal prohibitions against nonforcible 
intercourse with children who are below the age of consent. 
One way exceptions are made in statutes is by specifying the 
minimum age the offender must be (for example, at least age 18, 
at least age 20) for intercourse to be unlawful. Persons below 
this minimum age generally cannot be prosecuted. Another common 
way exceptions are made (virtually every State has these 
provisions in its laws) is by specifying how much older than 
the victim the perpetrator must be for criminal prosecution to 
occur. For example, by law in one State where age of consent 
is 16, no prosecution can occur unless the age difference is 
at least 3 years. In that State it is legal for a 17-year-old 
to have consensual intercourse with a 15-year-old, even though 
15 is below the age of consent; but the same act with a 15-year-
old is illegal when the other is 18. That is because the 17-
year-old is not 3 years older than the 15-year-old, whereas the
18-year-old is. The aim of such exceptions is to distinguish 
teen behavior from exploitative relationships between adults 
and children. Another exception is consensual intercourse
between husband and wife; no prosecution can occur if one 
spouse is below the age of consent.

Exceptions for children old enough to give consent Certain 
adults can be prosecuted for having consensual intercourse 
with a child who has reached the age of consent. For example, 
in one State it is a third degree felony for a psychotherapist 
to have intercourse with a 17-year-old client even though 17 
is over the minimum age of consent in that State. In another
State, where an adult generally cannot be prosecuted for 
having consensual intercourse with a 16-year-old, an 
exception is made when the adult is the child's school 
teacher. In that case the teacher can be prosecuted for a 
"class A" misdemeanor. Exceptions are made for other
professions as well (clergy, for example).

In this report, 443 of the 9,691 released sex offenders are 
identified as statutory rapists based on information supplied 
by the prisons that released them.  There were more than 443
statutory rapists among the 9,691 released male sex offenders, 
but the 443 are all that could be positively identified with 
the limited information available. One reason statutory 
rapists are not easily identified from penal code information
available on the released sex offenders is that most States do 
not use the term "statutory rape" in their laws.

First release  Though all 9,691 sex offenders in the study were 
released in 1994, for a fourth of the offenders 1994 was not the 
first year of release since receiving their prison sentence.
This group had previously served a portion of the sentence and 
were released, then violated parole and were returned to prison 
to continue serving time still left on that sentence. For the
remaining 75% of sex offenders released, the 1994 release was 
their "first release," meaning their first discharge from 
prison since being convicted and sentenced to prison.

"First release" should not be confused with first ever release 
from a prison. "First release" pertains solely to the sentence 
for the imprisonment offense (as defined above). It does not 
pertain to any earlier prison sentences offenders may have 
served for some other offense.

Attention is drawn to first releases because certain statistics 
in the report -- for example, "average time served," "percent 
of sentence served," "child molester's age when he committed 
the sex crime for which he was imprisoned" -- could only be 
computed for those prisoners classified as first releases. 
For such statistics, date first admitted to prison for their
imprisonment offense was needed. Since prison records made 
available for the study only provided this admission date on 
first releases, first releases necessarily formed the basis 
for the statistics.

Prior arrest  Statistics on prior arrests were calculated using 
arrest dates from the official criminal records of the 9,691 
released sex offenders. Only dates of arrest were counted, not 
the number of arrest charges associated with that arrest date. 
To illustrate, one man was arrested on March 5, 1970, and that 
one arrest resulted in 3 separate arrest charges being filed
against him. In this study, that March 5 arrest is considered 
one prior arrest.

Prior arrests were measured two different ways in this report.  
The first way did not include the imprisonment offense for 
which the sex offender was in prison in 1994. Prior arrest 
statistics that did not include the imprisonment offense are
found in sections of the report that describe the criminal 
records of the 9,691 sex offenders at the time of release 
from prison. In this case, any arrest that had occurred on 
a date prior to the sex offender's arrest for his imprisonment
offense was considered a prior arrest. For example, one released 
sex offender was found to have four different dates of arrest 
prior to the date of arrest for his imprisonment offense.
Those four arrests resulted in 17 different charges being 
brought against him. When describing this released prisoner's 
criminal record, he is considered to have four prior arrests.

The second way of measuring prior arrests did include the 
imprisonment offense of the released sex offender.  Prior 
arrest statistics that did include the imprisonment offense 
are found in sections of the report that describe the
recidivism rates of the 9,691 sex offenders following their 
release from prison. In this case, any arrest that had occurred 
on a date prior to the sex offender's release from prison was
considered a prior arrest. By definition, all 9,691 sex 
offenders had at least one arrest prior to their release, 
which was the sex crime arrest responsible for their being in 
prison in 1994. This means that the sex offender who was
arrested on four different dates prior to the arrest for his 
imprisonment offense under the first definition of prior arrest 
was, under this second definition, classified as having five 
prior arrests, once his imprisonment offense is included.

Thirteen tables in the report provide statistics on prior 
arrests (and, in 2 of the 13, prior convictions and prior 
imprisonments). In tables 15, 16, 17, 18, 27, 28, 29, 30, 
31, 36, and 37, "prior arrests" includes the sex crime arrest 
for the imprisonment offense; these tables have the heading 
"prior to 1994 release." In tables 5 and 6,"prior arrests"
excludes that arrest; these tables have the heading "prior 
to the sex crime for which imprisoned."

In all tables, the same counting rule was used: arrest dates, 
not arrest charges, were counted to obtain the number of prior 
arrests.

Rearrest  Unless stated otherwise, this recidivism measure is 
defined as the number or percentage of released prisoners who, 
within the first three years following their 1994 release,
were arrested either in the same State that released them (in 
this report those arrests are called "in-State" arrests) or in 
a different State (those arrests are referred to as "out-of-
State" arrests). Data on arrests came from State RAP sheets and 
FBI RAP sheets. RAP sheets (Records of Arrest and Prosecution) 
are law enforcement records intended to document a person's 
entire adult criminal history, including every arrest, 
prosecution and adjudication for a felony or serious 
misdemeanor offense. Arrests, prosecutions and adjudications for 
minor traffic offenses, public drunkenness, and other petty crimes 
are not as fully recorded as those for serious crimes. The "percent
rearrested" is calculated by dividing the number rearrested by the 
number released from prison in 1994.
 
All measures of recidivism based on criminal records are subject 
to two types of errors. Type 1 errors arise when the arrest or 
the conviction in the released prisoner's record is for a crime
that person did not commit. Type 2 errors arise when the released 
prisoner commits a crime but he is not arrested for it, or, even 
if he is, the arrest does not result in his conviction.

Some amount of type 1 and type 2 error is inevitable, however 
recidivism is measured. But that does not mean that all 
recidivism measures are equally suitable, no matter the purpose 
they are intended to serve. The main purpose of this
recidivism study was to document the percentage of sex offenders 
who continued their involvement in various types of crime after 
their release from prison in 1994. The more suitable measure for 
that is the one with the fewest type 2 errors: the one, in other 
words, less prone to saying someone is not committing crimes when
he actually is. Between rearrest and reconviction as the 
recidivism measure, the one less likely to make that type of 
error is rearrest.  One reason is that the rigorous standard used
to convict someone -- "proof beyond a reasonable doubt" -- makes 
it certain that guilty persons will sometimes go free. Another 
reason is record keeping: the justice system does better at 
recording arrests than convictions in RAP sheets. For such 
reasons, this study uses rearrest more often than reconviction as 
the measure of recidivism.

Rearrest forms a conservative measure of reoffending because many 
crimes do not result in arrest. Not all types of crime are alike 
in this regard. Crimes committed in nonpublic places (such as in 
the victim's home) by one family member against another (such as 
by the husband against his wife, or by the father against his own
child) are a type that is less likely than many other types to be 
reported to police and, consequently, less likely to result in 
arrest. Sex crimes, particularly those against children, are a 
specific example of this type.  While some sex offenders in this 
study probably committed a new sex crime after their release and 
were not arrested or convicted, the study cannot say how many.

As mentioned above, one reason why sex offenders are not arrested 
is that no one calls the police.  Results from the National Crime
Victimization Survey indicate that the offenses of rape/sexual 
assault are the least likely crimes to be reported to the 
police. (See Reporting Crime to the Police, 1993-2000, March 
2003, <http://www.ojp.usdoj/bjs/abstract/rcp00.htm>.) 

Reconviction  Except where stated otherwise, this recidivism 
measure pertains to State and Federal convictions in any State 
(not just convictions in the State that released them) in the
three years following release. Information on convictions came 
from State and FBI RAP sheets.  RAP sheets are intended to 
document every conviction for a felony or serious misdemeanor,
but not every conviction for a minor offense. "Percent 
reconvicted" is calculated by dividing the number reconvicted 
by the number released from prison in 1994. (It is not calculated 
by dividing the number reconvicted by the number rearrested.)

Return to prison Two recidivism measures are returned to prison --
 with a new sentence
 with or without a new sentence.
Recidivism defined as Returned to prison with a new sentence 
pertains exclusively to sex offenders who, within 3 years 
following release, were reconvicted for any new crime in 
any State following their release and received a new prison 
sentence for the new crime.

Recidivism defined as Returned to prison with or without a new 
sentence includes resentenced offenders plus any who were 
returned to prison within 3 years because they had violated a
technical condition of their release. Technical violations 
include things such as failing a drug test, missing an 
appointment with their parole officer, or being arrested for a 
new crime. Offenders returning to prison for such violations 
are sometimes referred to as "technical violators."

Prisons should not be confused with jails. A prison is a State 
or Federal correctional facility reserved for convicted persons 
with relatively long sentences (generally over a year). A jail 
is a local correctional facility for convicted persons with 
short sentences or for persons awaiting trial. Returns to prison 
refer to any prison, not necessarily the same prison that 
released the offender in 1994.

The "percent returned to prison with a new sentence" is calculated 
by dividing the number returned to prison with a new sentence by 
the number released from prison in 1994. The "percent returned to 
prison with or without a new sentence" is calculated by dividing 
the number returned to prison with or without a new sentence by 
the number released from prison in 1994.

Data on returns with a new sentence are based on State and FBI 
RAP sheets. Data on returns with or without a new sentence are 
based on State and FBI RAP sheets plus prison records. 

Demographic characteristics

All sex offenders

Of the 9,691 released sex offenders, approximately --

*  6,503 (67.1% of the 9,691) were white males
*  3,053 (31.5%) were black males
*  136 (1.4%) were males of other races (Asian, Pacific 
Islander, American Indian, and Alaska Native).

The vast majority of sex offenders were non-Hispanic males 
(80.1%). Half were over the age of 35 when released.

Rapists and sexual assaulters

As defined in this report, all sex offenders are either "rapists" 
or "sexual assaulters." Of the 9,691 released sex offenders, 
3,115 were rapists and the remaining 6,576 were sexual assaulters.

Of the 3,115 rapists, 1,735 (55.7% of 3,115) were white males and 
1,327 (42.6%) were black males. Of the 6,576 sexual assaulters, 
4,768 (72.5% of 6,576) were white males and 1,723 (26.2%) were
black males.

Rapists and sexual assaulters were close in age at time of release: 
over 70% were age 30 or older. Median age at time of release was 
about 35 years for both rapists and sexual assaulters.

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

Some of the 9,691 sex offenders were men whose imprisonment offense 
was a sex offense against a child. Precisely how many is unknown.
In this report, the 4,295 who could be identified are called "child 
molesters" The 4,295 identified child molesters included some (443 
out of the 4,295) whose specific sex offense against a child was 
non-forcible intercourse.  These 443 are called "statutory rapists.
"There were more than 443 among the 4,295, but 443 were all that 
could be identified from the limited information obtained for the 
study.

Both the 4,295 child molesters and the 443 statutory rapists were
predominantly non-Hispanic white males. Nearly three-fourths of 
the child molesters (73.2%) were age 30 or older. Just over half 
the statutory rapists (54%) were 30 or older at the time they were 
released from prison.

Among the released child molesters there were 3,333 white men (77.
6% of 4,295) and 889 black men (20.7%). The 443 statutory rapists 
included 324 white men (73.2% of 443) and 110 black men (24.8%). 

Sentence length and time served

All sex offenders

All 9,691 sex offenders selected to be in this study had a 
prison sentence greater than 1 year. The shortest terms were 
a day over 1 year; the longest were life sentences. The fact 
that sex offenders with a life sentence (18 offenders in the 
study) were among the 9,691 released in 1994 should not be 
surprising because only rarely do life sentences in the United 
States literally mean imprisonment for the remainder of a 
person's life.  Most felons receiving a life sentence are
eventually paroled (unpublished tabulation of data from the 
1997 BJS Survey of Inmates in State Correctional Facilities). 

On average, a sex offender released from prison in 1994 had an 
8-year term and served 31/2 years of that sentence (45%) before 
being released. Half of the released sex offenders had a sentence
length of 6 years or less. Half had served no more than a third 
of their sentence before being released. When released, the 
majority (54.5%)had more than 3 years of their sentence remaining 
to be served.

Rapists and sexual assaulters

Rape always involves forcible intercourse, whereas sexual assault 
(as the term is used here)never does, although it can involve 
other types of forcible sexual assault. Because forcible intercourse 
is considered to be a more serious offense than other forms of 
forcible sexual assault, penalties for rape are generally more
severe than those for sexual assault. 

Consistent with the more serious nature of 
rape --

*  on average a released rapist had a longer sentence (just over 
11 years) than a sexual assaulter (just under 7 years) 

*  on average a rapist spent more time in confinement before being 
released (51/2 years)than a sexual assaulter (just under 3 years)

*  median sentence length was longer for rapists (half of the 
rapists had a sentence of 9 years or more, while half of the 
sexual assaulters had a sentence of 51/2 years or more)

*  39.2% of the 3,115 rapists were in prison for over 5 years prior 
to release, while 12.5% of the 6,576 sexual assaulters served 61 
months or more

*  rapists served 49% of their sentence before being released, 
compared to 43% for sexual assaulters.  

Depending on the length of their sentence and the amount of time 
they had served before being released, some of the released sex 
offenders would have been on parole (or some other type of
conditional release) throughout the full 3 years they were tracked 
in this study. For example, when released, 63.3% of rapists had 
more than 3 years left to serve on their sentence. In their case,
any new crimes they committed during this 3-year followup period 
were offenses committed while still on parole. By comparison, just 
over half of released sexual assaulters had more than 3 years left 
to serve.

Child molesters and sexual assaulters 

On average, child molesters were released after serving nearly 3 
years (33.7 months) of their nearly 7-year sentence (81.1 months). 
Statutory rapists were released after serving a little over 2
years of their approximately 4-year sentence. Upon release, almost 
half of the child molesters still had at least 3 years of their 
sentence remaining to be served, compared to 15% of statutory 
rapists.             

Prior criminal record

All sex offenders

Arrests and convictions for minor traffic offenses, public 
drunkenness, and other petty crimes are often not entered into 
official criminal records. Since official records formed the basis 
for this study's statistics on arrests and convictions, these
statistics understate levels of contact with the justice system. 
Statistics shown throughout this report on arrests and convictions 
pertain mostly to arrests and convictions for felonies and serious
misdemeanors.

Statistics on prior arrests in this section of the report do not 
include the imprisonment offense for which the sex offender was in 
prison in 1994.

At the time the 9,691 male sex offenders were arrested for 
the sex crime that resulted in their imprisonment --

*  78.5% (7,607 of the 9,691 men) had been arrested at least one 
earlier time 

*  half had 3 or more prior arrests for some type of crime

*  58.4% (5,660 men) had at least one prior criminal conviction  

*  13.9% (1,347 men) had a prior conviction for a violent sex 
offense

*  4.6% (446 men) had been convicted for a sex crime against a 
child

*  nearly a quarter had served time in a State or Federal prison at 
least once before for some type of crime.

All 9,691 were in prison in 1994 because they had been arrested and 
convicted for a sex offense.  For 71.5% of the 9,691 men (6,929), 
that arrest was their first ever for a violent sex crime. In other
words, these 6,929 men had no previous arrest for a sex offense. 
For the remaining 28.5% (2,762 men), that arrest was not their first 
sex offense arrest. Some had been arrested once before for a sex 
crime and some two or more times before.

To illustrate, one of the 9,691 sex offenders in this study had 
his first arrest for a sex crime in 1966, when he was age 19; he 
was also arrested for sex crimes in the 1970's and 1980's, in 
three different States. The arrest for his imprisonment offense 
was in 1982. In the early part of 1983, 4 months after his arrest, 
he was convicted of sexual assault and began serving a 25-year
prison term. Eleven years later, in 1994 at age 47, he was 
released.

For 75% of the 9,691 sex offenders, their 1994 release represents 
their first release since being sentenced for their sex offense. 
The remaining 25% had previously served time under the same
sentence, had been released, had violated one or more conditions 
of their parole and, consequently, were returned to prison to 
continue serving time still remaining on their sentence.

Sex offenders compared to non-sex offenders

A total of 262,420 non-sex offenders were released from State 
prisons in 1994 in the 15 States. Of the 262,420 non-sex 
offenders, 94% had at least 1 prior arrest and 82% had at least 
1 prior conviction (not in a table).  Overall, the 9,691 sex 
offenders had a shorter criminal history than the 262,420 non-
sex offenders. Before the arrest that resulted in their prison 
sentence, sex offenders had been arrested 4.5 times, on average. 
This prior arrest record was about half that of non-sex offenders 
(8.9 prior arrests). In addition, among the 1994 prison releases, 
23.7% of the sex offenders (2,297), compared to 44.3% of non-sex 
offenders (116,252), had served prior prison sentences.

Sex offenders were more likely to have been arrested (28.5%) or 
convicted (13.9%) for a sexual offense than non-sex offenders (6.5% 
with a prior arrest for a sex crime; 0.2% with a prior conviction 
for a sex crime).  The same is true for child molesting -- about 1 
in 10 sex offenders had a prior arrest for a sex offense against a 
child, compared to about 1 in 100 non-sex offenders.

Rapists and sexual assaulters

For approximately 71% of the 3,115 rapists, the arrest for rape that 
resulted in their imprisonment was their first for a sex crime. The 
remaining 29% had one or more prior sex crime arrests. Likewise,
for sexual assaulters, the sexual assault arrest that led to their
imprisonment was the first arrest for a sex crime for 72% of the 
6,576 sexual assaulters. The remaining 28% had been arrested at 
least once before for some type of sex crime. 

Child molesters and sexual assaulters 

The 4,295 child molesters had at least 1 arrest for child molesting 
(the arrest that led to their imprisonment). For 3,509 (81.7%) of 
them, that arrest was their first ever arrest for child molesting. 
For the other 786 men (18.3% of the 4,295), that was not their 
first. Some had one prior arrest for a sex offense against a child, 
some had two, and others had three or more.

Among those with three or more priors was a man whose first arrest 
for child molesting was in 1966, when he was age 20. When released 
in 1994, he was serving an 11-year sentence for molesting a child 
under age 14. The prior criminal record of this serial pedophile 
spanned three decades, with arrests for child molesting in the 
1970's, the 1980's, and the 1990's. 

Four measures of recidivism

This section measures recidivism four ways:

*  percent rearrested for any type of crime
*  percent reconvicted for any type of crime
*  percent returned to prison with a new prison sentence 
for any type of crime
*  percent returned to prison with or without a new prison 
sentence.  "Percent rearrested" is calculated by dividing 
"the number rearrested" by "the number released from prison 
in 1994."

"Percent reconvicted" is obtained by dividing "the number 
reconvicted" by "the number released from prison in 1994." (It 
is not calculated by dividing "the number reconvicted" by "the 
number rearrested.")

"Percent returned to prison with a new sentence" is calculated by 
dividing "the number returned to prison with a new sentence" by 
"the number released from prison in 1994.' (It is not calculated
by dividing "the number returned to prison with a new sentence' by 
'the number reconvicted.')

Except where stated otherwise, all four recidivism
measures --

*  refer to the full 3-year period following the prisoner's release 
in 1994

*  include both "in-State" and "out-of-State" recidivism.

"In-State" recidivism refers to new offenses committed within the 
State that released the prisoner in 1994. "Out-of-State" recidivism 
is any new offenses in States other than the one that released him 
in 1994.

Not all 4 of the recidivism measures are based on
data from 15 States  

* "Percent rearrested' is based on 15 States

* "Percent reconvicted" is based on 14 of the 15 States 
participating in the study

* "Percent returned to prison with a new sentence" is based 
on 13 of the 15 States

* "Percent returned to prison with or without a new sentence" 
is based on 9 of the 15.

Three of the four recidivism measures were calculated from data on 
fewer than 15 States because the information needed to perform the
calculations was not available (or not readily available) from each 
of the 15 participating States. Notes at the bottom of the tables 
alert readers to such missing data.

Four measures

All sex offenders 

The 9,691 sex offenders in this study were all released from prison 
in 1994. Within the first 3 years following their release --

*  43% (4,163 of the 9,691) were rearrested for at least 1 new 
crime 

*  24% (2,326 of the 9,691) were reconvicted for any type of 
crime

*  11.2% (1,085 of the 9,691) were returned to prison with 
another sentence

*  38.6% (3,741 of the 9,691) were returned to prison with or 
without a new sentence.

For approximately three-fourths of the 4,163 men who were rearrested 
for some new crime, their most serious rearrest offense was a felony;
for the remaining fourth, the most serious was a misdemeanor (not 
shown in table).

Of the 4,163 men rearrested for some new offense, nearly 9 in 10 
(87%) were still on parole when taken into custody (not shown in 
table).

The 2,326 reconvicted for a new crime consisted of 1,672 (71.9%) 
whose most serious conviction offense was a felony, and 654 (28.1%)
whose most serious offense was a misdemeanor (not shown in table).

Of the 2,326 reconvicted for any new crime after their release, 
1,085 were resentenced to prison, and the remaining 1,241 were 
placed on probation or ordered to pay a fine or sentenced to
short-term confinement in a local jail. The 1,241 not 
resentenced to prison made up a little over half (54%) of the 
total 2,326 reconvicted. A major reason why over half were not 
resentenced to prison was that the new conviction offense for
about 900 of the 2,326 newly convicted men (approximately 40%) 
was a misdemeanor rather than a felony, and State laws usually 
do not permit State prison sentences for misdemeanors.

Altogether, 3,741 (38.6%) of the 9,691 released sex offenders were 
returned to prison either because of a new sentence or a technical
violation. Of the 3,741, 2,656 (71%) were returned for a technical 
violation, such as failing a drug test, missing an appointment with 
the parole officer, or being arrested for another crime; and 1,085 
were returned with a new prison sentence. The 2,656 consisted of 670 
who were reconvicted but not resentenced to prison, plus 1,986 not
reconvicted.

As previously explained, a total of 1,241 released sex offenders were
reconvicted but not resentenced to prison for their new crime. The
1,241 included 670 (described immediately above) who were returned to 
prison for a technical violation. The 670 were 54% of the 1,241, 
indicating that most of those who were reconvicted but not given a 
new prison sentence were, nevertheless, returned to prison.

Sex offenders compared to non-sex offenders

The 15 States in this study released 272,111 prisoners altogether in 
1994.  The 9,691 released sex offenders made up 3.6% of that total. 
The remaining 262,420 released prisoners were non-sex offenders. Of 
the 262,420 non-sex offenders, 68% (179,391 men and women out of the 
262,420) were rearrested for a new crime within 3 years (not shown 
in table). The 43% overall rearrest rate of the 9,691 released sex
offenders (4,163 out of 9,691) was low by comparison.

Another difference was the rearrest charge. The rearrest offense 
was a felony for about 3 out of 4 (75%) of the 4,163 rearrested 
sex offenders (not shown in table). By comparison, about 84% of 
the 179,391 non-sex offenders were charged by police with a 
felony (not shown in table).

Of the 4,163 sex offenders rearrested for a new crime, nearly 9 in 
10 (87%) were on parole when taken into custody; of the 179,391 
rearrested non-sex offenders, also about 9 in 10 (85%) were on 
parole (not shown in table).

There was a difference in reconvictions. The reconviction rate for 
the 9,691 released sex offenders was 24.0%, compared to 47.8% for
262,420 non-sex offenders released in 1994 (not shown in table). 
The 2,326 sex offenders reconvicted for any new crime included 
1,672 (71.9%) whose most serious conviction offense was a felony 
(not shown in table). Of the 262,420 non-sex offenders, 125,437 
(47.8%) were reconvicted, which included 94,078 (75.0%)whose most 
serious reconviction offense was a felony (not shown in table).

Rapists and sexual assaulters

Within the first 3 years following release --

*  46.0% of the 3,115 rapists (1,432 men) and 41.5% of the 
6,576 sexual assaulters (2,731 men) were rearrested for all 
types of crimes

*  27.3% of the 3,115 rapists (850 men) were reconvicted, 
compared to 22.4% of the 6,576 sexual assaulters (1,473 
men)for all types of crimes

*  12.6% of the 3,115 rapists (392 men) and 10.5% of the 
6,576 sexual assaulters (690 men) were resentenced to 
prison for their reconviction offense

*  43.6% of the 3,115 rapists (1,358 men) and 36.1% of the 
6,576 sexual assaulters (2,374 men) were returned to prison 
either because of a new sentence or because of a technical
violation of their parole.

For approximately three-fourths of the 1,432 rapists who were 
rearrested for a new crime, the crime was a felony; for the 
remainder, the most serious was a misdemeanor (not shown in 
table). As indicated earlier, 2,731 sexual assaulters were
rearrested for a new offense after their release, and for about 
three-fourths, their most serious rearrest offense was a felony; 
for the remainder, the most serious crime was a misdemeanor 
(not shown in table).

The 850 rapists reconvicted for any new crime included 617 (72.6%) 
whose most serious reconviction offense was a felony; the 1,473
reconvicted sexual assaulters included 1,052 (71.4%) who were 
reconvicted for a felony (not shown in table).

Child molesters and statutory rapists  

Of the child molesters and statutory rapists
released from prison in 1994 --

*  1,693 of the 4,295 child molesters (39.4%) and 221 of the 
443 statutory rapists (49.9%) were rearrested for a new crime 
(not necessarily a new sex crime)

*  876 of the 4,295 child molesters (20.4%) and 145 of the 443 
statutory rapists (32.7%) were reconvicted for any type of crime

*  9% of the 4,295 child molesters and 13% of the 443 statutory 
rapists were resentenced to prison for their new conviction 
offense

*  38% of the 4,295 child molesters and 46% of the 443 
statutory rapists were back in prison within 3 years as 
a result of either a new prison sentence or a technical 
violation of their parole.

The most serious offense for three-fourths of the 1,693 child 
molesters who were rearrested was a felony, and a misdemeanor 
for the remainder (not shown in table). Following their release 
in 1994, 221 statutory rapists were rearrested for a new crime. 
The most serious offense that approximately three-fourths were 
charged with was a felony (not shown in table).

The 876 child molesters reconvicted for any type of crime included 
643 (73.4%) whose most serious reconviction offense was a felony; 
the 145 reconvicted statutory rapists included 97 (66.7%) whose 
most serious was a felony (not shown in table).

Time to recidivism

All sex offenders

Within 6 months following their release, 16% of the 9,691 men were 
rearrested for a new crime (not necessarily another sex offense). 
Within 1 year, altogether 24.2% were rearrested. Within 2 years the 
cumulative total reached 35.5%. By theend of the 3-year followup 
period, 43% (4,163 of the 9,691) were rearrested for some type of 
crime.

These statistics indicate that most recidivism within the first 3 
years following release occurred in the first year (56%, since 2
4.2% / 43% = 56%).

While the bulk of rearrests occurred in the first year, that period 
did not account for the bulk of reconvictions or reimprisonments. 
This is largely because a sizable number of those rearrested in the 
first year were not reconvicted and reimprisoned until sometime in 
the second year, due to the additional time needed to prosecute,
convict, and sentence a criminal defendant. For example, by the end 
of the first year, 8.6% of the 9,691 released sex offenders were 
reconvicted, and by the end of the third year, a cumulative total
of 24% were reconvicted, indicating that the first year accounted 
for a relatively small percentage of all the reconvictions in the 3 
years (36%, since 8.6% / 24% = 36%).

Rapists and sexual assaulters

Forty-six percent of released rapists were rearrested within 3 years, 
and over half of those rearrests (56%) occurred in the first year 
(since 25.8% / 46.0% = 56%). Similarly, 41.5% of released sexual 
assaulters were rear-rested within the first 3 years following their 
1994 release, and over half of those rearrests (56%)occurred in the 
first year (since 23.4% / 41.5% = 56%).

Child molesters and statutory rapists

Of the 4,295 released child molesters, 1,693 (39.4%) were 
rearrested during the 3-year followup period. The majority 
of those charged (approximately 982 of the 1,693, or 58%) 
were charged in the first 12 months. While 49.9% of released 
statutory rapists were rearrested within 3 years, nearly three-
fifths of those rearrests occurred within the first year 
following release (29.8% / 49.9% = 60%).

Rearrest for any type of crime

Demographic characteristics

All sex offenders 

Race Black men (56.1%) released in 1994 were more likely than white 
men (36.7%) to be rearrested for a new crime (not limited to just a
new sex crime) within the first 3 years following their release.

Hispanic origin  Among released sex offenders, non-Hispanics (45.9%) 
were more likely than Hispanics (42.2%) to have a new arrest within 
the 3-year followup period.

Age  The younger the prisoner when released, the higher the rate of
recidivism. For example, of all the sex offenders under age 25 at the 
time of discharge from prison, 59.8% were rearrested for some type of 
crime within 3 years, or more than double the 23.5% of those age 45 
or older.

Rapists and sexual assaulters 

Race  Among releasees whose imprisonment offense was sexual assault, 
57% of black men and 35.8% of white men were rearrested for all types 
of crimes. A higher rearrest rate for blacks was also found among 
released rapists.

Hispanic origin  Among released rapists, non-Hispanics (50.2%) were 
more likely than Hispanics (47.7%) to be rearrested within the 3-year 
followup period. The same was true among released prisoners whose 
imprisonment offense was sexual assault.

Age  For both rapists and sexual assaulters, younger releasees had 
higher rearrest rates than older releasees.

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

Race  The rearrest rate among released child molesters was 51.7% for 
black men and 36.2% for white men. Among statutory rapists, black men
(61.5%) had a higher rearrest rate than white men (46.0%).

Hispanic origin  Among released prisoners whose imprisonment 
offense was statutory rape, Hispanics (56.9%) were more likely 
than non-Hispanics (48.8%) to be rearrested within the 3-year 
followup period. The opposite was true of child molesters, as 
Hispanics had a lower rearrest rate (37.1%) than non-Hispanics 
(41.9%).

Age The younger the sex offender was when released, the higher 
was his likelihood of being rearrested.  For example, the 
rearrest percent for statutory rapists younger than 25 was higher
(70.0%) than the rearrest percent for statutory rapists ages 25 
to 30 (56.4%). The same was true among child molesters.

Time served before 1994 release

All sex offenders 

Sex offenders who served the shortest amount of time in prison 
before being released (6 months or less) had a higher rearrest 
rate (45.7%) than those who served the longest (over 5 years,
39.9% rate). Similarly, prisoners who served 6 months or less 
had a higher rearrest rate (45.7%)than those who served 7 months 
to 1 year (42.1%). However, other comparisons did not indicate a 
connection between serving more time and lower recidivism. For 
example, among sex offenders who served 1 to 11/2 years in prison
before being released, 38.9% were rearrested for all types of 
crimes, compared to 46.7% of sex offenders who served a bit 
longer -- 11/2 to 2 years. Similarly, released prisoners who 
served between 3 and 5 years in prison had a higher rate of 
rearrest (38.9%) than released prisoners who served 21/2 to 3 
years (35.7%).  Because of these mixed results, and others 
illustrated below, the data do not warrant any general conclusion 
about an association between the level of recidivism and the 
amount of time served.

Rapists and sexual assaulters 

Among sexual assaulters who served no more than 6 months, 45.0% were
rearrested for all types of crimes. Those who served a little longer
-- from about 6 months to 1 year -- had a lower rearrest rate, 43.1%. 
Those released after serving even more time -- 1 to 11/2 years -- had 
an even lower rate, 39.2%. However, there are numerous instances where 
serving more time was not linked to lower recidivism. For example, 
rapists released after about 1 to 11/2 years in prison had a 37.6%
rearrest rate, while those imprisoned a little longer -- from about 
11/2 to 2 years -- had a higher rate, 51.1%.

Child molesters and statutory rapists

Among released statutory rapists and child molesters, the results 
continued to be mixed regarding an association between the rate of
recidivism and the amount of time served. For example, child 
molesters released after serving about 2 to 21/2 years had a higher 
rate of rearrest for all types of crimes (39.4%) than those who 
served somewhat longer -- about 21/2 to 3 years (27.2%). However, 
the rearrest rate rose (31.5%) among molesters who served more 
time -- 3 to 5 years.  

Prior arrest for any type of crime

All sex offenders

For 2,084 sex offenders (21.5% of the 9,691 total), their only 
arrest prior to being released in 1994 was the arrest for their 
imprisonment offense (a sex offense). Among these 2,084 released 
sex offenders with just 1 prior arrest, 24.8% were rearrested for 
a new crime (not necessarily a new sex crime). For the remaining
7,607 (78.5% of 9,691), their prior record showed an arrest for 
the sex offense responsible for their current imprisonment plus 
at least 1 earlier arrest for some type of crime. Of these 7,607 
prisoners, 47.9% were rearrested, or about double the rate of 
their counterparts with 1 prior arrest (24.8%).

Rapists and sexual assaulters

Of the 3,115 released rapists, 83.1% (2,589 rapists) had more than 
1 arrest for some type of crime prior to their release from prison 
in 1994, and 16.9% (526 rapists) had just 1 prior arrest, the arrest 
for the sex crime that resulted in their being in prison in 1994.  
The multiple prior arrests for the 2,589 rapists included the arrest 
for their imprisonment offense plus at least 1 other arrest for any 
type of crime. The 2,589 with more than 1 prior arrest had a rearrest 
rate (49.6%) nearly double that of the 526 with just 1 prior (28.3%).

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

Of the 4,295 child molesters, 76.8% (3,299 men)had more than 1 prior 
arrest. These 3,299 child molesters had a rearrest rate (44.3%) nearly
double the 23.3% rate of the 996 molesters with just 1 prior arrest 
(996 is 23.2% of 4,295). The 357 statutory rapists with more than 1 
prior arrest (357 is 80.6% of 443) had a rearrest rate (55.7%)more 
than double the 25.6% rate of the 86 statutory rapists with 1 prior 
arrest (86 is 19.4% of 443).

Number of prior arrests for any type 
of crime

Statistics on prior arrests in this section of the report do include 
the imprisonment offense of the released sex offender.

All sex offenders

The number of times a prisoner was arrested in the past was a 
relatively good predictor of whether that prisoner would continue 
his criminality after re- lease. Prisoners with just one prior 
arrest for any type of crime had a 24.8% rearrest rate for all types 
of crimes. With two priors, the percentage rearrested rose to 31.9%.
With three, it increased to 36.9%. With four, it went up to 42.6%. 
With additional priors, there were further increases, ultimately 
reaching a rearrest rate of 67.0% for released prisoners with the 
longest criminal record (more than 15 prior arrests).

Rapists and sexual assaulters 

Both rapists and sexual assaulters followed the pattern described 
immediately above: the more prior arrests they had, the more likely 
they were to have a new arrest for some type of crime after their 
release in 1994.

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

Among released prisoners with the smallest number of prior arrests 
(1 prior arrest), 23.3% of child molesters and 25.6% of statutory 
rapists were rearrested for all types of crimes within 3 years. 
Rearrest rates generally rose with each increase in the number of 
prior arrests. Among released prisoners with the largest number of
prior arrests (more than 15), 62.0% of child molesters and 76.2% 
of statutory rapists had at least 1 new arrest after being released 
in 1994.

State where rearrested for any type of crime

The State where the rearrest occurred was not always the State that 
released the prisoner. In some cases, the released sex offender left 
the State where he was imprisoned and was rearrested for a new crime 
in a different State. For example, a sex offender released from 
prison in California may have traveled to Nevada, where he was 
arrested for committing another crime.

Sex offenders

A total of 4,163 sex offenders were rearrested for some type of new 
crime after their 1994 release. Of the 4,163 arrests, 16.0% -- or 1 
in 6 -- were outside the State where the prisoner was released. The 
rest (84.0%) were made in the State that released them.

Sex offenders compared to non-sex offenders

The 15 States in this study released 262,420 non-sex offenders in 
1994, of whom 179,391 were rearrested for a new crime within 3 
years (not shown in table). Of the 179,391 arrests for any type of 
crime, 11.2%, or 20,092 arrests, were arrests that occurred outside 
the State that released them.

Rearrested sex offenders had a higher percentage: 1 in 6 of their 
rearrests for any type of crime were in a State other than the one 
that released them.

Rapists and sexual assaulters

Following their 1994 release, 1,432 rapists and 2,731 sexual 
assaulters were rearrested for any new crime.  For 17.4% of the 
1,432 rearrested rapists, and 15.2% of the 2,731 rearrested sexual
assaulters, the place where the arrest occurred was in a different 
State than the one that released them. 

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

Out of the 4,295 child molesters, 1,693 were rearrested for any new 
crime after being released from prison in 1994. The 1,693 recidivists
consisted of 84.8% whose new arrest was in the same State that 
released them in 1994, and 15.2% whose alleged violation occurred 
in a different State.

About half of all statutory rapists were not rearrested for any 
type of crime after their release. Of the 221 who were, 16.6% were 
rearrested outside the State where they were released.    
  
Rearrest and reconviction for a new sex crime

Rearrest and reconviction

All sex offenders 

Based on official arrest records, 517 of the 9,691 released sex 
offenders (5.3%) were rearrested for a new sex crime within the 
first 3 years following their release. The new sex crimes for which 
these 517 men were arrested were forcible rapes and sexual assaults. 
For virtually all of the 517, the most serious sex crime for which 
they were rearrested was a felony. Their victims were children and 
adults. The study cannot say what percentage were children and what 
percentage were adults because arrest files did not record the 
victim's age.

Of the total 9,691 released sex, 3.5% (339 of the 9,691) were 
reconvicted for a sex crime (a forcible rape or a sexual assault) 
within 3 years.

Sex offenders compared to non-sex offenders

The 15 States in this study released a total of 272,111 prisoners in 
1994. The 9,691 released sex offenders made up less than 4% of that 
total. Of the remaining 262,420 non-sex offenders, 3,328 (1.3%) were
rearrested for a new sex crime within 3 years (not shown in table). 
By comparison, the 5.3% rearrest rate for the 9,691 released sex 
offenders was 4 times higher.

Assuming that the 517 sex offenders who were rearrested for another 
sex crime each victimized no more than one victim, the number of sex
crimes they committed after their prison release totaled 517. Assuming 
that the 3,328 non-sex offenders rearrested for a sex crime after 
their release also victimized one victim each, the number of sex crimes 
they committed was 3,328. The combined total number of sex crimes is 
3,845 (517 plus 3,328 = 3,845). Released sex offenders accounted for 
13% and released non-sex offenders accounted for 87% of the 3,845 sex
crimes committed by all the prisoners released in 1994 (517 / 3,845 = 
13% and 3,328 / 3,845 = 87%).

Rapists and sexual assaulters

Of the 3,115 rapists, 5.0% (155 men) had a new arrest for a sex 
crime (either a sexual assault or another forcible rape) after 
being released. Of the 6,576 released sexual assaulters, 5.5% 
(362 men) were rearrested for a new sex crime (either a forcible 
rape or another sexual assault).

A total of 100 released rapists were reconvicted for a sex crime. 
The 100 men were 3.2% of the 3,115 rapists released in 1994. Among 
the 6,576 released sexual assaulters, 3.7% (243 men) were
reconvicted for a sex crime.

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

After their release, 5.1% (221 men) of the child molesters and 5.0% 
(22 men) of the statutory rapists were rearrested for a new sex 
crime. Not all of the new sex crimes were against children. The new 
sex crimes were forcible rapes and various types of sexual assaults.

Following their release, 3.5% (150 men) of the 4,295 released child 
molesters were convicted for a new sex crime against a child or an 
adult. The sex crime reconviction rate for the 443 statutory rapists 
was 3.6% (16 reconvicted men).

Time to rearrest

All sex offenders

Within 6 months following their release, 1.4% of the 9,691 men were 
rearrested for a new sex crime. Within 1 year the cumulative total 
grew to 2.1% rearrested. By the end of the 3-year followup period, 
altogether 5.3% had been rearrested for another sex crime. The first 
year was the period when 40% of the new sex crimes were committed 
(since 2.1% / 5.3% = 40%).  

Rapists and sexual assaulters 

The first year following release accounted for 40% of the new sex 
crimes committed by both released rapists (since 2.0% / 5.0% = 40%) 
and released sexual assaulters (since 2.2% / 5.5% = 40%). 

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

For child molesters and statutory rapists, the first year following 
their release was the period when the largest number of recidivists 
were rearrested. Similar to rapists and sexual assaulters, about 40% 
of the arrests for new sex crimes committed by child molesters and 
statutory rapists occurred during the first year.

Demographic characteristics

All sex offenders 

Race  Among sex offenders released from prison in 1994, black men 
(5.6%) and white men (5.3%)were about equally likely to be 
rearrested for another sex crime.  

Hispanic origin  Among released sex offenders, non-Hispanics were 
more likely to be rearrested for a new sex offense (6.4%) than 
Hispanics (4.1%).  One reason for the lower rearrest rate for
Hispanics may be that some were deported immediately following 
their release.

Age  Recidivism studies typically find that, the older the prisoner 
when released, the lower the rate of recidivism. Results reported 
here on released sex offenders did not follow the familiar pattern. 
While the lowest rate of rearrest for a sex crime (3.3%) did belong 
to the oldest sex offenders (those age 45 or older), other 
comparisons between older and younger prisoners did not consistently 
show older prisoners' having the lower rearrest rate. 

Time served before 1994 release

All sex offenders 

The study compared recidivism rates among prisoners who served 
different lengths of time before being released from prison in 
1994. No clear association was found between how long they were 
in prison and their recidivism rate. For example, those sex 
offenders who served from 7 to 12 months were rearrested for a 
new sex crime at a higher rate (5.2%) than those who served
slightly less time (3.8%), which seemed to suggest that serving 
more time raised the recidivism rate. But other comparisons 
suggested the opposite. Compared to men who were confined for 7 
to 12 months (5.2% rearrest rate), those who served more time (13 
to 18 months) were less likely to be rearrested for any new sex
crime (4.1%).

Prior arrest for any type of crime

All sex offenders 

Of the 9,691 released sex offenders, 21.5% (2,084 of the 9,691) 
had only 1 arrest in their criminal record up to the time they were 
released. That one arrest was the arrest for the sex crime that 
resulted in a prison term. The remaining 78.5% (7,607 men) had the 
arrest for their imprisonment offense in their record, and they
also had at least 1 earlier arrest for some type of crime. For 
example, some had an earlier arrest for theft or a drug offense. 
Most of them did not have an earlier arrest for a sex crime.

Compared to the 2,084 sex offenders with the 1 arrest in their 
criminal record, the 7,607 with a longer prior arrest record were 
more likely to be rearrested for another sex crime (5.9% compared 
to 3.3%).

Rapists and sexual assaulters 

Of the 3,115 released rapists, the majority (83.1% of the 3,115, 
or 2,589 men) had more than 1 arrest (for any type of crime) prior 
to release from prison in 1994. Of these 2,589 released rapists,
5.4% (140) had a new arrest for a sex crime. The rate was lower 
(3.0%) for the 526 released rapists with no prior arrest.

Results for sexual assaulters followed the same pattern: the 
5,017 sexual assaulters with more than 1 prior arrest (76.3% of 
6,576 is 5,017) were more likely to be rearrested for a new sex 
crime (6.2%) than the 1,559 with just the 1 prior arrest (23.7% 
of 6,576 is 1,559). 

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

Released child molesters with more than one prior arrest were more 
likely than those with only one arrest in their criminal record to 
be rearrested for a new sex crime (5.7% compared to 3.2%). The same 
was true of statutory rapists (5.3% compared to 3.5%).

Number of prior arrests for any type of crime

All sex offenders

The more arrests (for any type of crime) the sex offender had in his 
criminal record, the more likely he was to be rearrested for another 
sex crime after his release from prison. Sex offenders with one prior 
arrest (the arrest for the sex crime for which they had been 
imprisoned) had the lowest rate, about 3%; those with 2 or 3 prior 
arrests for some type of crime, 4%; 4 to 6 prior arrests, 6%; 7 to 
10 prior arrests, 7%; and 11 to 15 prior arrests, 8%. 

Prior arrest for a sex crime

All sex offenders

Prior to their release in 1994, 2,762 of the sex offenders (28.5% of 
the total 9,691) had 2 or more arrests for a sex offense in their 
criminal record: the arrest for the sex offense that resulted in 
their imprisonment, plus at least 1 earlier arrest for a sex crime. 
For the remaining 6,929 (71.5% of the total 9,691), their only prior 
arrest for a sex crime was the arrest that brought them into prison. 
(Any other prior arrests the 6,929 may have had were for non-sex 
crimes.) Following their release, the 2,762 with more than 1 sex 
crime in their criminal background were about twice as likely to be
rearrested for another sex crime (8.3%) as the 6,929 with a single 
prior arrest (4.2%).

Rapists and sexual assaulters 

Rapists (4.0%) and sexual assaulters (4.2%) with one prior arrest for 
a sex crime were less likely to be rearrested for another sex crime 
than rapists (7.4%) and sexual assaulters (8.7%) who had been arrested 
two or more times for a sex crime prior to release from prison in 1994.

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

By definition, all 4,295 child molesters had been arrested for 
a sex offense at least once prior to their release in 1994 -- 
the sex offense that landed them in prison. For 3,049 of them 
(71% of 4,295), that arrest was their only prior arrest for a
sex offense. The remaining 1,246 child molesters (29% of 4,295) 
had at least 2 prior arrests for a sex crime: the arrest for their
imprisonment offense plus at least 1 other prior arrest for a sex
offense (not necessarily one against a child). Of the 1,246 child 
molesters with multiple sex crimes in their past, 8.4% (105 of 
the 1,246) were rearrested for another sex crime (not necessarily
another sex crime against a child), or more than double the 3.8% 
rate for the 3,049 released child molesters with just 1 prior 
arrest for a sex crime.

Similar results were found for released statutory rapists.  Those 
with a more extensive record of prior arrests for sex crimes were 
more likely to be   rearrested for another sex crime (8.8%) than
those with just one past arrest (2.6%). 

State where rearrested for a sex crime

When sex offenders were arrested for new sex crimes after their 
release, the new arrest typically occurred in the same State that 
released them. Those arrests are referred to as "in-State" arrests.
When released sex offenders left the State where they were 
incarcerated and were charged by police with new sex crimes, those 
arrests are referred to as "out-of-State" arrests.

All sex offenders

Of the 9,691 released sex offenders, 517 were rearrested for a new 
sex crime within 3 years. Most of those sex crime arrests (85.2% of 
the 517, or 440 men) were in the same State that released them. 
Seventy-seven of them (14.8% of the 517) were arrests in a different 
State.

Sex offenders compared
to non-sex offenders

The 15 States in this study released 262,420 non-sex offenders in 
1994, of whom 3,328 were rearrested for a new sex crime within 3 
years (not shown in table). Of the 3,328 non-sex offenders arrested 
for a new sex crime, an estimated 10% were men rearrested outside 
the State that released them. The 15% figure for released sex
offenders was high by comparison.

Rapists and sexual assaulters 

A total of 155 released rapists and 362 released sexual assaulters 
were rearrested for a new sex crime within the 3-year followup 
period. In-State arrests for new sex crimes accounted for 85% of 
the rearrested rapists and 85% of the rearrested sexual assaulters.
Out-of-State arrests accounted for the rest.

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

A total of 221 child molesters were rearrested for a new sex crime 
(not necessarily against a child) after their release. Among the 
221 were 191 (86.6%) whose new sex crime arrest was in the same 
State that released them in 1994. For the remaining 13.4%, the 
arrest was elsewhere.

Of all statutory rapists, 5% (22) were rearrested for a new sex 
crime after their release. Of these 22, none had the new arrest 
outside the State that released them. 

Rearrest for a sex crime against a child

Undercounts of sex crimes against children

This section documents percentages of men who were arrested for a 
sex crime against a child after their release from prison in 1994. 
To some unknown extent, these recidivism rates undercount actual 
rearrest rates. That is because the arrest records that the study 
used to document sex crime arrests did not always contain enough 
information to identify those sex crime arrests in which the 
victim of the crime was a child. Some sense of the potential size 
of the undercount can be gained by comparing rearrests for any sex 
crime and rearrests for any sex crime against a child. Rates of 
rearrest for a sex crime are from 2 to 31/2  percentage points 
higher than rates of rearrest for a sex crime against a child,
suggesting that rates of rearrest for a sex crime against a child 
could be, at most, a few percentage points below actual rates.

No data on precise ages of molested children

This section also documents the ages of the children that the men 
were alleged to have molested after their release from prison. Sex
crime statutes contained in the arrest records of the released 
prisoners were used to obtain ages. The first step was to identify 
those sex crime statutes that were applicable just to children.
Among those that were, some were found to apply just to children 
whose age fell within a certain range (for example, under 12, or 13 
to 15, or 16 to 17). Those statutes applicable to children within 
specified age ranges became the source of information on the 
approximate ages of the allegedly molested children. Information on
precise ages could not be determined because statutes applicable just 
to children of a specific age (for example, just to 12-year-olds, or 
just to age 15-year-olds) do not exist. 

Rearrest

All sex offenders 

Following their release in 1994, 209 of the total 9,691 released sex 
offenders (2.2%) were rearrested for a sex offense against a child. 
For virtually all 209, the rearrest offense was a felony. For the 
reason given earlier, the 2.2% figure undercounts the percentage 
rearrested for a sex offense against a child. It seems unlikely 
that the correct figure could be as high as 5.3%, which is
the percentage rearrested for a sex crime against a person of any 
age. The only way it could be that high is if none of the sex crime 
arrests after release were crimes in which the victim was an adult, 
an unlikely possibility. The more likely possibility is that the 
2.2% figure undercounts the rate by a maximum of 1 or 2 percentage 
points.

An estimated 76% of the children allegedly molested by the 209 men 
after their prison release were age 13 or younger, 12% were 14- or
15-years-old, and the remaining 12% were 16- or 17-years-old. 

Sex offenders compared to non-sex offenders

Prisons in the 15 States in the study released 272,111 prisoners 
altogether in 1994, 9,691 of whom were the sex offenders in this 
report. As previously stated, 2.2% of the 9,691 sex offenders
were rearrested for a child sex crime after their release. That 
rate is high compared to the rate for the remaining 262,420 non-
sex offenders. Of the 262,420 non-sex offenders, less than half of 
1 percent (1,042 of the 262,420) were rearrested for a sex offense 
against a child within the 3-year followup period (not shown in 
table).

Since each of the 1,042 was charged at arrest with molesting at least 
1 child, the total number they allegedly molested was conservatively
estimated at 1,042. Of the conservatively estimated 1,042 children, 
65% were age 13 or younger, 11% were 14- or 15-years-old, and 24%
were 16- or 17-years-old (not shown in table).  (These percentages 
were based on the 554 cases out of the 1,042 in which the approximate
age of the child could be determined.)

Assuming that the 209 sex offenders who were rearrested for a sex crime
against a child each victimized no more than one child, the number of
sex crimes they committed against children after their prison release 
totaled 209.  Assuming that the 1,042 non-sex offenders rearrested for 
a sex crime against a child after their release also victimized only one
child, the number of sex crimes against a child that they committed was
1,042. The combined total number of sex crimes is 1,251 (209 plus 1,042 
= 1,251).  Released sex offenders accounted for 17% and released non-sex
offenders accounted for 83% of the 1,251 sex crimes against children 
committed by all the prisoners released in 1994 (209 / 1,251 = 17% and 
1,042 / 1,251 = 83%).

Rapists and sexual assaulters

Following their 1994 release, 1.4% of the 3,115 rapists (44 men) and 
2.5% of the 6,576 sexual assaulters (165 men) were rearrested for
molesting a child.

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

Within 3 years following their release from prison in 1994, 141 (3.3%) 
of the released 4,295 child molesters and 11 (2.5%) of the 443 released
statutory rapists were rearrested for molesting another child.  For the
reasons outlined earlier, these percentages undercount actual rearrest
rates by a few percentage points at most.

Each of the 141 released molesters rearrested for repeating their crime
represented at least 1 child victim. Of the conservatively estimated 141
children allegedly molested by released child molesters, 79% were age 13 
or younger, 9% were 14 or 15 years of age, and 12% were ages 16 or 17. 

Prior arrest for a sex crime against a child

All sex offenders 

After their 1994 release from prison, sex offenders with a prior 
arrest for child molesting were more likely to be arrested for child 
molesting (6.4%) than those who had no arrest record for sex with a 
child (1.7%).

Rapists and sexual assaulters 

After being released in 1994, 4.0% of rapists with a prior arrest 
record for child molesting and 1.3% of those without were arrested 
for child molesting. The same pattern -- having a history of alleged
child molesting was associated with a greater likelihood of arrest 
for child molesting -- was found for sexual assaulters. Those with 
a prior arrest had a 6.9% rate; those without, 1.9%.     

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

The 4,295 released child molesters fell into 2 categories: 1) 3,509 
(81.7% of the 4,295) whose criminal record prior to their 1994 release
contained no more than 1 arrest for a sex offense against a child (this 
was the offense for which they were imprisoned); and 2) 786 (18.3%) 
whose record showed the arrest for their imprisonment offense plus at 
least one earlier arrest for a sex offense against a child. After 
release, 7.3% of the 786 and 2.4% of the 3,509 were rearrested for
molesting another child, indicating that child molesters with multiple 
arrests for child molesting in their record posed a greater risk of 
repeating their crime than their counterparts.

Similarly, the 443 statutory rapists consisted of  -
* 356 (80.4%) whose first arrest for a sex offense against a child 
was the arrest that resulted in their current imprisonment
*  87 (19.6%) with more than 1 prior arrest for a sex offense against 
a child.

The 87 were more likely to be rearrested for child molesting (6.9%) 
than the 356 (1.4%).

Molester's and child's ages at time of imprisonment 
offense

Child molesters

The released child molesters were all men who were arrested, convicted, 
and sentenced to prison for a sex crime against a child. At the time 
they committed their imprisonment offense, most (62.9%) were age 30
and older, and most (60.3%) molested a child who was age 13 or younger. 
Some of the victims were below age 7. Nearly half of the men (48.4%)
were 20 years or more older than the child they were imprisoned for 
molesting.

Among the men who were in prison for molesting a child age 13 or 
younger and who were released in 1994 for that crime, 2.8% were 
subsequently arrested for molesting another child. Of those
whose imprisonment offense was against a 14- or 15-year-old, 3.7% 
had a new arrest for child molesting after their release. Of the 
men who were in prison for molesting a 16- or 17-year-old, 1.2% 
were arrested by police for molesting another child after leaving 
prison in 1994.

Among the men who were 20 years or more older than the child they 
were imprisoned for molesting, 2.5% were rearrested for another sex 
offense against a child within the first 3 years following their 
release. That is a lower rate than the 3.2% rate for men who were 
10 to 19 years older than the child victim in their imprisonment 
offense, and compared to the 3.6% for those 5 to 9 years older
than the victim in their imprisonment offense.

State where rearrested for a sex crime against
a child

When sex offenders were arrested for new sex crimes against children 
after their release, the new arrest typically occurred in the same 
State that released them. Those arrests are referred to as "in-State" 
arrests. When arrests occurred in a different State, they are 
referred to as "out-of-State." 

All sex offenders

Of the 9,691 sex offenders, 209 were rearrested for child molesting 
after their release from prison in 1994. In 180 cases (86.3%), the 
alleged crime took place in the State that released him. In the 29 
others (13.7%), it occurred elsewhere.

Sex offenders compared to non-sex offenders

The 15 States in this study released 262,420 non-sex offenders in 1994, 
of whom 1,042 were rearrested for a sex crime against a child (not
shown in table). Of the 1,042 arrests, 11% were out-of-State rearrests. 
The comparable figure for released sex offenders was higher: 14%.

Rapists and sexual assaulters

Forty-four released rapists and 165 released sexual assaulters were 
rearrested for a sex crime against a child within 3 years. Out-of-State
arrests for child molesting accounted for 13.5% of the 44 rearrested 
rapists and 13.7% of the 165 rearrested sexual assaulters.

Child molesters and statutory rapists

Police arrested 141 of the 4,295 released child molesters for repeating 
their crime. For 126 of them (89.2%), the new arrest for child molesting
was in the same State that released them. For 15 (10.8%), the new charges 
for child molesting were filed in a different State.
Of the 443 statutory rapists released from prison in 1994, 11 were 
rearrested for child molesting. All 11 of the arrests were in the 
same State that released the men. 

Rearrest for other types of crime

All sex offenders

Of the 9,691 male sex offenders released from
prison in 1994 --

*  43% (4,163 men) were rearrested for a crime of any kind
*  5.3% (517 men) were rearrested for a sex offense
*  17.1% (1,658 men) were rearrested for a violent crime
*  13.3% (1,285 men) were rearrested for a property crime of 
some kind.

Of the 9,691 released men, 168 (1.7%) were rearrested for rape and 396 
(4.1%) were rearrested for sexual assault. The 168 rearrested for rape 
plus the 396 rearrested for sexual assault totals 564, which is 47 
greater than the total 517 who were rearrested for a sex crime. The 
reason is that 47 men were rearrested for both rape and sexual assault.

The category of violent crime for which a prisoner was most likely to 
be rearrested was assault (8.8%, or 848 of the 9,691); the category 
least likely was homicide (0.5%, or 45 of the 9,691 men).

Just over 1 in 5 sex offenders (2,045 out of 9,691)were rearrested for 
a public-order offense, such as a parole violation or traffic offense.

Rapists and sexual assaulters 

Among the 3,115 released rapists --
 
*  46% (1,432) were rearrested for a crime of any kind
*  18.7% (582) were rearrested for a violent crime
*  0.7% (22) were rearrested for homicide
*  14.7% (459) were rearrested for a property offense.

A relatively small percentage of rapists (2.5%, or 78 of the 3,115) were
charged with repeating the crime for which they were imprisoned.

Among the 6,576 released sexual assaulters --

*  41.5% (2,731) were rearrested for a crime of any kind
*  16.4% (1,076) were rearrested for a violent crime
*  0.3% (23) were rearrested for killing someone 
*  12.6% (826) were rearrested for a property offense.

Nearly 1 in 20 released sexual assaulters (4.7%, or 308 of the 6,576) 
were charged with committing the same type of crime for which had just 
served time in prison.

Child molesters and statutory rapists 

Of the 4,295 child molesters released from prison
in 1994 --

*  39.4% (1,693) were rearrested for a crime of any kind
*  0.4% (17) were rearrested for intentionally or negligently 
   killing someone.

Child molesters were less likely to be rearrested for a property crime 
(10.6%, 456 of 4,295) than a violent crime (14.1%, 607 of 4,295).

Of the 443 statutory rapists released in 1994 --

*  49.9% (221) were rearrested for some new crime
*  0.7% (3) were rearrested for homicide 
*  22.6% (100) were rearrested for a property crime
*  21.2% (94) were rearrested for a violent crime.      

-------------------------------------------------
Victims of sex crimes

Survey of State inmates

The 9,691 prisoners in this study were all men sentenced to prison for 
sex crimes. Characteristics of the victims of these sex crimes were 
largely unavailable for the study. For information on imprisoned sex 
offenders and their victims, data were drawn from a survey covering
the approximately 73,000 male sex offenders in State prisons nationwide 
in 1997.

Of the 73,000 victims of their sex crimes --
*  about 90% were female
*  nearly 75% were white
*  89% were non-Hispanic
*  36% were below age 13
*  altogether, 70% were under age 18.

Child victims of sex crimes were more likely than adult victims to be 
male (11% versus 3%). Whites made up 76% of child victims and 66% of 
adult victims.

The biggest difference between child victims and adult victims was their
relationship to the man who committed the sex crime:

Among cases where the victim was under 18, the boy or girl was the 
prisoner's own child (16%), stepchild (16%), sibling or stepsibling 
(2%), or other relative (13%) in nearly half of all child victim 
cases (46%). Among cases where the victim was an adult, the victim 
was a relative less often (11%).

Among inmates who were in prison for a sex crime against a child, the 
child was the prisoner's own child or step- child in a third of the 
cases.  Seven percent of the inmates reported their child victims to 
have been strangers.  Among adult victims, 34% were strangers to their
attacker.
---------------------------------------------

Methodology

3-year followup period

For analytic purposes, "3 years" was defined as 1,096 days from the 
day of release from prison.  Any rearrest, reconviction, or 
reimprisonment occurring after 1,096 days from the 1994 release was 
not included. A conviction after 1,096 days was not counted even if 
it resulted from an arrest within the period. 

Separating sex offenders into four types 

The report gives statistics for four types of sex offenders. Separating 
sex offenders into the four types was done using information -- in 
particular, the statute number for the imprisonment offense, the literal
version of the statute, a numeric FBI code (called the "NCIC" code, 
short for "National Crime Information Center") indicating what the
imprisonment offense was, and miscellaneous other information -- 
available in the prison records on the 9,691 men. However, the prison 
records obtained for the study did not always contain all four pieces 
of information on the imprisonment offense. Moreover, the available 
offense information was not always detailed enough to reliably 
distinguish different types of sex offenders.

The process of sorting sex offenders into different types involved first
creating the study's definitions of the four types, and then determining 
which State statute numbers, which literal versions of those statutes, 
and which NCIC codes conformed to the definitions. Each inmate was next
classified into one of the types (or possibly into more than one type, 
since the four are not mutually exclusive) depending on whether the
imprisonment offense information available on him fit the study's 
definition.

An obstacle to classifying sex offenders into types was that the labels
"rape," "sexual assault," "child molestation," "statutory rape" were 
not widely used in State statutes, and when they were used they did not 
always conform to the study's definitions of them.  In deciding which 
type of sex offender to classify the prisoner as, importance was 
attached not to the label the law gave to his conviction offense, but 
to how well the law's definition of the offense fit the study's 
definition of the type.

Sex offenders compared to non-sex offenders

In 1994, prisons in 15 States released 272,111 prisoners, representing
two-thirds of all prisoners released in the United States that year. 
Among the 272,111 were 262,420 released prisoners whose imprisonment 
offense was not a sex offense. Non-sex offenders include inmates, both
male and female, who were in prison for violent crimes (such as murder 
or robbery), property crimes (such as burglary or motor vehicle theft),
drug crimes, and public order offenses.  Like the 9,691 male sex 
offenders examined in this report, all non-sex offenders were serving 
prison terms of one year or more in State prison when they were released 
in 1994.

At various places, this report compares 9,691 released male sex offenders 
to 262,420 released non-sex offenders.  While labeled "non-sex offenders," 
the 262,420 actually includes a small number- 87- who are sex offenders.  
The 87 are all the female sex offenders released from prisons in the 15 
States in 1994.

Ages of molested and allegedly molested children

Information on the ages of molested children was needed for two 
calculations: 1) age of the child the released sex offender was sent 
to prison for molesting, and 2) age of the child allegedly molested by 
the released sex offender during the 3-year follow-up period. The most
frequent source of both was a sex statute: either the sex statute the 
offender was imprisoned for violating, or the statute the released 
prisoner was charged with violating when he was rearrested for a sex 
crime.  The former was obtained from the prison records assembled for 
the study; the latter, from the assembled arrest records. 

None of the sex statutes was found to apply to a victim of a specific 
age; for example, just to 12-year-olds. But some were found to apply 
just to children in a certain age range; for example, under 12, or 13 
to 15, or 16 to 17. While specific ages of children could not be 
obtained from statutes, the availability of information on age ranges 
at least made it possible to obtain approximate ages. The rule that was
adopted was to record the victim's (or alleged victim's) age as the 
upper limit of a statute's age range. To illustrate, a statute might 
indicate that the complainant/victim be "at least 13 but less than 16
years of age." In that case, the age of the child was recorded as 15, 
since the statute indicated the upper limit of the age range as any 
age "less than 16." As another example, if a statute indicated the
complainant/victim be "under 12 years of age," the child's age was 
recorded as 11, as the phrasing of the age range did not include
12-year-olds, only those "under 12." Because the victim (or alleged 
victim) was always assigned the age of the oldest person in the age 
range, the study made the victims (or alleged victims) appear older 
than they actually were.

How missing data were handled in the report

In many instances, the data needed to calculate a statistic were not 
available for all 9,691 released sex offenders. For example, the 9,691 
were released in 15 States, but data needed to determine the number
reconvicted were only available for the 9,085 released in 14 of the 
15. Of the 9,085, 2,180 (24%) were reconvicted. When data were missing, 
the statistic was computed on those cases in which the data were 
available, but treated both in the tables and in the text as though
it were based on the total population. For example, "24%" is the 
statistic that appears in all tables and text that give the 
percent reconvicted; and since 24% of 9,691 is 2,326, the text says
that 2,326 of the 9,691 were reconvicted," despite the fact that 
the "24%" was actually obtained by dividing 2,180 by 9,085. The text 
could have been written to say 2,180 of the 9,085 were reconvicted," 
but that wasn't done because introducing a new denominator (9,085) 
into the text would have created confusion for the reader.

Missing data on out-of-State rearrests

Because of missing information, the study was unable to determine how 
many inmates released from New York prisons were rearrested outside of
New York. The study was able to document how many prisoners released 
in the other 14 States were rearrested outside the State that released
them. Because of incomplete New York data, the report's recidivism 
rates are somewhat deflated.

Missing data on rearrest for a sex crime

According to arrest records compiled in the study, 4,163 of the 9,691 
released sex offenders were rearrested for a new crime of some kind. 
It was not always possible to determine from these records whether the 
new crime was a sex crime. For 202 rearrested prisoners, the arrest 
record did not identify the type of crime. For the rest the record did
identify the type but the offense label was not always specific enough
to distinguish sex crimes from other crimes. For example, if the label
said "contributing to the delinquency of a minor," "indeceny," "morals
offense," "family offense," or "child abuse," the offense was coded as 
a non-sex crime even though, in some unknown number of cases, it was 
actually a sex crime.

According to arrest records, 5.3% of the 9,691 (517 out of 9,691) 
released sex offenders were rearrested for another sex crime. For the 
two reasons described immediately above, 5.3% was probably an undercount 
of how many were rearrested for a sex crime.  How much of an undercount 
could not be firmly determined from the data assembled for the study. 
However, a conservative measure of the size of the undercount was 
obtained from the data. The study database included 121 rearrested sex
offenders whose arrest record did not indicate they were rearrested for 
a sex crime (the rearrest was either for a non-sex crime or for an 
unknown type of crime) but whose court record did indicate they were 
charged with a sex crime. When the study calculated the percentage 
rearrested for a sex crime, the 121 were not included among the 517 with 
a rearrest for a sex crime. Had the 121 been included in the calculation 
of the rearrest rate, the total number rearrested for a sex crime would 
have been 638 rather than 517, and the percentage rearrested for a sex 
crime would have been 6.6% rather than 5.3%. This suggests an undercount 
of about 1 percentage point.

Texas prisoners classified as "other type of
release"

Texas released 692 male sex offenders in 1994, of which 129 were 
classified as release category 17", defined as "other type of 
release." Numerous data quality checks were run on the 129 and the
64 of them who were rearrested. The rearrest rate for the 129 was 
about average for Texas releases. But numerous anomalies were found 
for the 64 who were rearrested: 1. The rearrest offense for the 64 
was always missing from their arrest record 2. The date of rearrest 
for the 64 was always the same as their release date 3. Virtually 
all 64 were reconvicted for a sex crime 4. The sentence length 
imposed for their new sex crime was identical to the sentence they 
were serving when released in 1994.  Because of these anomalies, the 
129 were excluded from the calculation of "percent reconvicted for a 
sex crime."

Counting rules

In this report, rearrest was measured by counting the number of 
different persons who were rearrested at least once. A released 
prisoner who was rearrested several times or had multiple rearrest 
charges filed against him was counted as only one rearrested person. 
The same counting rule applied to reconviction and the other
recidivism measures.

If a released prisoner was rearrested several times, his earliest 
rearrest was used to calculate his time-to-rearrest. The same 
counting rule applied to reconviction and recidivism defined as
a new prison sentence.

If a released prisoner had both in-State and out-of-State rearrests, 
he was counted as having an out-of-State rearrest regardless of 
whether the out-of-State rearrest was his earliest rearrest. The
same rule applied in cases where the released prisoner had both 
felony and misdemeanor rearrests, or both sex crime and non-sex crime
rearrests. The person was counted as having a felony rearrest or a sex 
crime rearrest regardless of temporal sequence.

The aim of these rules was to count people, not events. The only tables 
in the report that do not follow the rule are tables 41 and 42.

First release

All 15 States had first releases, but they could not be identified in 
1 State (Ohio). They could be identified in Michigan, but Michigan data 
on sentence length did not fit the study's definition. Since sentence 
length was critical to several statistics calculated from data on first
releases (for example, percent of sentence served), Michigan was 
excluded from all tables based on first releases.

Analysis of statutory rape laws
     
The publication's analysis of statutory rape laws in the United States
benefitted greatly from the report "Sexual Relationships Between Adult
Males and Young Teen Girls: Exploring the Legal and Social Responses," 
by Sharon G. Elstein and Noy Davis, American Bar Association, Center on
Children and the Law, October 1997.

Sampling error

In 1994 State prisons in 15 States released 302,309 prisoners altogether. 
A total of 38,624 were sampled for a recidivism study. Results of that 
study and information regarding sampling and other methodological details 
are available in the BJS publication Recidivism of Prisoners Released in 
1994, NCJ 193427, June 2002. 

The 302,309 total released consisted of 10,546 released sex offenders plus
291,763 released non-sex offenders. The 38,624 sample consisted of 10,546
released sex offenders plus 28,078 released non-sex offenders. The number 
of sex offenders in the sample was the same as the number in the 302,309 
total because all sex offenders released in 1994 in the 15 States were
selected for the study, not a sample of them.

Because no sampling was used to select sex offenders, numbers and 
percentages in this report for sex offenders were not subject to 
sampling error. However, comparisons in the report between sex offenders 
and non-sex offenders were subject to sampling error because sampling
was used to select non-sex offenders. Where sex offenders were compared 
to all non-sex offenders released in 1994, sampling error was taken into
account. All differences discussed were statistically significant at 
the .05 level.

Not all 10,546 sex offenders in the sample were used in the report. To 
be in the report, the sex offender had to be male and meet all 4 of the
following criteria:

1. A RAP sheet on the prisoner was found in the State criminal history
repository.

2. The released prisoner was alive throughout the entire 3-year followup
period. (This requirement resulted in 21 sex offenders' being excluded.)

3. The prisoner's sentence was greater than 1 year (missing sentences 
were treated as greater than 1 year).

4. The State department of corrections that released the prisoner in 
1994 did not designate him as any of the following release types: 
release to custody/detainer/warrant, absent without leave, escape, 
transfer, administrative release, or release on appeal.

A total of 9,691 released male sex offenders met the selection criteria.  
The number of them released in each State is shown in the appendix
table.

Other methodological details

To help the reader understand the percentages provided in the report, 
both the numerator and denominator were often given.  In most cases, 
the reader could then reproduce the percentages.  For example, the 
report indicates 38.6% (3,741) of the 9,691 sex offenders were returned 
to prison. Using the 3,741 and the 9,691, the reader could exactly 
reproduce the results.  However, the reader should be aware that in a  
few places, the calculated percentages will differ slightly from the
percentages found in the report. This is due to rounding. For example, 
43.0%, or 4,163, of the 9,691 sex offenders were rearrested; however,
4,163 / 9,691 is 42.96%, which was rounded to 43.0%.

Offense definitions and other methodological details are available in
