At yearend 2010, 36 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons
held 3,158 inmates under sentence of death, 15 fewer inmates
than at yearend 2009. This represents the tenth consecutive
year that the number of inmates under sentence of
death has decreased.

Four States (California, Florida, Texas, and Pennsylvania)
held more than half of all inmates on death row as of
December 31, 2010. The Federal Bureau of Prisons held 58
inmates on death row.

Of those under sentence of death at yearend, 55% were white
and 42% were black. The 388 Hispanic inmates under sentence
of death accounted for 14% of inmates with a known ethnicity.
Ninety-eight percent of inmates under sentence of death were
male, and 2% were female. The race and gender of those under
sentence of death has remained relatively unchanged since
2000.

During 2010, 119 inmates were removed from under
sentence: 46 were executed, 20 died by means other
than execution, and 53 were removed as a result of
sentences or convictions overturned or commutations
of sentences. A total of 104 inmates were received
under sentence of death during 2010, representing the
smallest number of admissions since 1973 when 44
persons were admitted.

During 2010, 22 states and the Federal Bureau of
Prisons received 104 prisoners under sentence of
death. Admissions in California (24), Florida (14),
Arizona (9), and Texas (8) accounted for 53% of those
sentenced to death in 2010.

Twelve states executed 46 inmates during 2010, 6 fewer
inmates than in 2009. The inmates executed in 2010
had been under sentence of death an average of 14
years and 10 months, which was 9 months longer than
those executed in 2009.

Of the 7,879 people under sentence of death between
1977 and 2010, 16% had been executed, 6% died by
causes other than execution, and 39% received other
dispositions.***Footnote *Following the U.S. Supreme Court's
approval of revised statutes in some states (Gregg v.
Georgia), executions of inmates resumed in 1977.***

Four states revised capital statutes in 2010

At yearend 2010, the death penalty was authorized by 36
states and the federal government (table 1). While New
Mexico repealed the death penalty in 2009 (Laws 2009, ch.
11  5), the repeal was not retroactive. As of December 31,
2010, New Mexico held two men under previously imposed
death sentences, and one person was awaiting sentencing
with the state seeking the death penalty.

During 2010, four states revised statutory provisions
relating to the death penalty:

South Carolina--Amended the list of aggravating factors
to include murder committed while in the commission of
trafficking in persons ( 16-3-20(c)(a)(1)(c)), effective
June11, 2010.

Tennessee--Added as an aggravating circumstance the
intentional murder of a pregnant woman when it was known
by the defendant that the victim was pregnant (Tenn. Code
Ann  39-13-204(i)(16)), effective July 1, 2010.

Utah--Revised the minimum sentence required in capital
felony cases in which the jury does not reach a unanimous
decision to impose a death sentence. The minimum sentence
was increased from an indeterminate sentence of 20 years
to life to an indeterminate sentence of 25 years to life
(Utah Code Ann  76-3-207 and  76-5-202), effective May 11,
2010.

Virginia--Revised the definition of capital murder to
include fire marshals, auxiliary police officers, and
auxiliary deputy sheriffs among law enforcement officers
killed while performing official duties (Va Code 
18.2-31(6)), effective July 1, 2010.

Lethal injection was authorized by all states with capital
statutes 

As of December 31, 2010, all 36 states with death penalty
statutes authorized lethal injection as a method of execution
(table 2). 

In addition to lethal injection, 16 states authorized an
alternative method of execution. Nine states authorized
electrocution; three states, lethal gas; three states,
hanging; and two states, firing squad.

For states that authorize multiple methods of execution, the
method is generally selected by the condemned prisoner.
Five of the 16 states stipulated which method must be used
depending on either the date of the offense or sentencing.
One state authorized hanging only if lethal injection could
not be given. Five states authorized alternative methods
if lethal injection is ruled to be unconstitutional: one
authorized hanging, one state authorized electrocution, one
authorized electrocution or firing squad, one authorized
firing squad, and one authorized lethal gas.

The method of execution of federal prisoners is lethal
injection, pursuant to 28 CFR, Part 26. For offenses under
the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of
1994, the method is that of the state in which the conviction
took place (18 U.S.C. 3596).

**************************************
Executions in 2011

Between January 1 and December 19, 2011, 13 states
executed 43 inmates, which was 3 fewer than the number
executed as of the same date in 2010.

Three states accounted for more than half of the
executions carried out during this period: Texas executed
13 inmates; Alabama executed 6; and Ohio executed 5.

Of the 43 executions carried out during this period, all
were by lethal injection.

No women were executed during this period

Methodology

Capital punishment information is collected annually as part
of the National Prisoner Statistics program (NPS-8). This
data series is collected in two parts: data on persons under
sentence of death are obtained from the department of
corrections in each jurisdiction currently authorizing
capital punishment, and information on the status of death
penalty statutes is obtained from the Office of the Attorney
General in each of the 50 states, the District of Columbia,
and the federal government. Data collection forms are
available on the BJS website at www.bjs.gov.

NPS-8 covers all persons under sentence of death at any
time during the year who were held in a state or federal
nonmilitary correctional facility. Included are capital
offenders transferred from prison to mental hospitals and
those who may have escaped from custody. Excluded are
persons whose death sentences have been overturned by the
court, regardless of their current incarceration status.

The statistics reported in this report may differ from data
collected by other organizations for a variety of reasons:
(1) NPS-8 adds inmates to the population under sentence of
death not at sentencing but at the time they are admitted to
a state or federal correctional facility; (2) if inmates
entered prison under a death sentence or were reported as
being relieved of a death sentence in one year but the court
had acted in the previous year, the counts are adjusted to
reflect the dates of court decisions (See note on table 4 for
the affected jurisdictions.); and (3) NPS-8 counts are always
for the last day of the calendar year and will differ from
counts for more recent periods.

All data in this report have been reviewed for accuracy by
the data providers in each jurisdiction prior to publication.
