Bulletin

Census of Jails: Population Changes, 1999–2013

Todd D. Minton, BJS Statistician
Scott Ginder, Susan M. Brumbaugh, Hope Smiley-McDonald, and Harley Rohloff, 
RTI International

The nation’s local jail authorities supervised an estimated 
731,570 confined inmates at yearend 2013 (table 1). The number of 
confined inmates includes those who were unconvicted and awaiting 
court action on a current charge, convicted offenders awaiting 
sentencing, and sentenced offenders. Jail authorities also 
supervised about 9,670 persons who were serving a weekend-only 
sentence on the weekend prior to December 31, 2013. In addition, 
jail authorities supervised about 46,770 persons under community 
supervision through programs such as electronic monitoring, house 
arrest, community service, day reporting, and work programs at 
yearend 2013. The population excludes persons supervised by a 
probation or parole agency.

Based on a complete enumeration of all locally operated jails, 
the 2013 Census of Jails, which was collected through the Deaths 
in Custody Reporting Program’s Annual Summary on Inmates Under 
Jail Jurisdiction, gathered facility-level information on the 
number of confined and nonconfined jail inmates. Previous 
censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, 1999, 2005, 
and 2006. In years between census collections, the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics (BJS) collected data from a sample of local 
jails to estimate the number and composition of inmates in local 
jails nationwide. This report uses the jail information from the 
1999, 2006, and 2013 censuses to provide state and national level 
estimates and to examine changes in the number of inmates held, 
characteristics of jail inmates, the number of admissions, jail 
capacity to hold inmates, and jail staffing.

By combining data from the census and annual surveys in noncensus 
years, BJS tracked the size and composition of local jails in the 
United States. After a surge from 1999 to 2008, the confined 
inmate population declined in local jails from midyear 2008 to 
yearend 2013 (table 2). The number of inmates confined in local 
jails increased 23% between 1999 (605,943) and 2006 (748,197). 
Since 2006, the inmate population declined by 2.2% (table 3).

HIGHLIGHTS
*************

* From 1999 to 2013, the number of inmates in local jails 
increased by 21%, from 605,943 to 731,570.  During this period, 
the growth in the jail population was not steady, as the jail 
confined population peaked in 2008 at 785,533 then declined to 
its 2013 level.

* The adult jail incarceration rates changed slightly between 
midyear 1999 (304) and yearend 2013 (310).

* Nearly half (46%) of all local jail inmates were confined in 
jurisdictions holding 1,000 or more inmates in 2013, down 
slightly from 50% in 2006.

* Between 1999 and yearend 2013, the female inmate population 
increased by 48%, from approximately 68,100 to 100,940. The male 
inmate population increased by 17%, from approximately 537,800 to 
630,620.

* The juvenile population (persons age 17 or younger) held in 
adult jail facilities in 2013 (4,420) decreased by more than half 
from its peak in 1999 (9,458).

* Jails admitted nearly 12 million persons during the 12-month 
period ending December 31, 2013, down from a peak of 13.6 million 
in 1998.

* Among jail inmates, the expected length of inmate stay was 23 
days in 2013.

* The rated capacity of local jails increased an estimated 39% 
(252,550 beds) between 1999 and 2013, which was nearly twice 
the rate of the inmate population (up 21% or 125,630 inmates).

* From 1999 to 2013, the number of correctional officers 
increased by 16% from 149,600 to 173,900. Jails in the South 
employed the largest share (47%) of all correctional offices 
in 2013, up from 44% in 1999.
***********************************************

This analysis includes 15 locally operated jails in Alaska. 
It excludes the federal jurisdiction and combined jail/prison 
systems in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, 
and Vermont (see Federal jails in textbox for analysis on 
the Bureau of Prisons detention centers).

*******************************************
Montana had the largest percentage increase 
in jail inmates; the District of Columbia 
had the largest decline
*******************************************

Twenty-two states experienced an increase in jail inmates, while 
22 states and the District of Columbia experienced declines between 
2006 and 2013. The jail population in New Mexico remained relatively 
stable. Southern states, including the District of Columbia, accounted 
for 50% of the local jail inmate population, up slightly from 47% in 
1999 but remaining stable since 2006. The northeast states accounted 
for the smallest proportion (13%) of the jail population in 2013, 
down slightly from 14% of all local jail inmates in 1999 and 2006.

Combined, nine states accounted for more than half of the local jail 
inmate population in 2013: California (11%), Texas (9%), Florida (7%), 
Georgia (6%), Pennsylvania (5%), Louisiana (4%), Virginia (4%), New York
 (4%), and Tennessee (4%). Jails in California, Oklahoma, Kentucky, 
Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee reported an increase of at least 
2,000 inmates from 2006 to 2013 (see The Impact of California’s 2011 
Public Safety Realignment Policy on the California and national jail 
population.) Jails in Florida reported the largest absolute decline 
(down 10,370 inmates) in the jail inmate population between 2006 and 
2013, followed by New York (down 5,370 inmates). Jails in Montana 
reported the largest percentage increase (up 47%) in their inmate 
population from 2006 to 2013, followed by jails in Arkansas, North 
Dakota, Oklahoma, and Nebraska (up at least 29% each). Jails in the 
District of Columbia reported the largest percentage decline 
(down 35%) in their jail inmate population.

*******************************************
Adult jail incarceration rates increased 
between 1999 and 2013
*******************************************

The incarceration rate of adult inmates in local jail
jurisdictions increased slightly between midyear 1999 (304 inmates 
per 100,000 adult U.S. residents) and yearend 2013 (310 per 100,000) 
(table 4). Since 1999, the adult jail inmate incarceration rate increased 
in 27 states and the District of Columbia and declined in 17 states 
(not calculated for Alaska).

Louisiana (870), Mississippi (590), Kentucky (570), New Mexico (560), 
Georgia (550), and Tennessee (530), had the highest adult jail inmate 
incarceration rates in the United States at yearend 2013. Minnesota 
(150), Maine (160), and Iowa, New Hampshire, and New York (each 170) 
reported the lowest incarceration rates.

The adult incarceration rate increased at least 50% in six states since 
1999, including North Dakota (up 99%), Kentucky (up 68%), Oklahoma (up 
60%), Arkansas and West Virginia (each up 52%), and Montana (up 56%) (not 
shown). Oregon (down 28%), New York (down 26%), Florida (down 24%), and 
New Jersey (down 20%) reported the largest decline in the adult jail 
incarceration rates.

*******************************************
Nearly half of all local jail inmates were 
confined in jurisdictions holding 1,000 or 
more inmates in 2013
*******************************************

Local jail jurisdictions holding 1,000 or more inmates at yearend 2013 
accounted for 46% (335,610 inmates) of the total local jail inmate 
population on December 31, 2013 (table 5). This was down from 50% in 2006 
and 48% in 1999 (not shown). Nearly two-thirds (466,370 inmates) of the 
local jail population were confined in jails holding 500 or more inmates 
at yearend 2013. The smallest jail jurisdictions—those holding fewer than 
50 inmates—accounted for 3% (23,280 inmates) of the local jail inmate 
population.

*******************************************
The female and white inmate populations 
increased at a faster rate than the male 
and black inmate populations
*******************************************

At yearend 2013, most inmates in local jails were male (86%) (table 6), a 
decline from 89% in 1999 (not shown). The female local jail population 
increased by 48% between 1999 and yearend 2013, from 68,100 to 100,940. 
Females accounted for 14% of the local jail population in 2013, up from 
about 11% in 1999. Male inmates made up at least 90% of the reported jail 
population in 2013 in Massachusetts, the District of Columbia, New York, 
Mississippi, Louisiana, and New Jersey. The largest concentrations of 
female inmates (at least 20% of their states’ total jail inmate 
population) were in West Virginia, South Dakota, and Idaho.

At yearend 2013, white inmates accounted for an estimated 47% of the 
total local jail inmate population, an increase from 41% in 1999 (table 
7). Black inmates declined from 42% in 1999 to 34% in 2013, while the 
proportion of Hispanic inmates remained stable at about 16% each year. 
Due to missing data in the 2006 Census of Jail Facilities, race data were 
not reported for that census year.

Nearly half of all white inmates and nearly 60% of black inmates were 
held in jails located in southern states. Jails in Georgia (9%) and 
California and Florida (8% each) held the largest proportion of black 
inmates. Texas (8%) and Florida and California (7% each) held the largest 
proportion of white inmates. The largest concentration of American Indian 
and Alaska Native (51%) and Hispanic (43%) inmates was in western states. 
New Mexico (13%) and Arizona (10%) held the largest proportion of 
American Indian and Alaska Natives in local jails. California (28%) and 
Texas (19%) held the largest proportion of Hispanic inmates in local 
jails.

*******************************************
The juvenile population held in adult 
facilities decreased significantly since 
its peak in 1999
*******************************************

At yearend 2013, the juvenile population (age 17 or younger) in adult 
jails accounted for less than 1% (4,420) of the local jail inmate 
population, down significantly since the juvenile population peaked at 
1.6% (9,458) of the local jail inmate population in 1999 (not shown). 
Most juveniles were male (92%) and held as adults (84%).

*******************************************
Jails admitted nearly 12 million persons 
during the 12-month period ending 
December 31, 2013
*******************************************

Local jails admitted more than 11.9 million persons during the 12-month 
period ending December 31, 2013, up from 11.4 million in 1999, but down 
from the peak number of new admissions (13.6 million) to local jails in 
2008 (see Jail Inmates at Midyear 2011 - Statistical Tables, NCJ 237961, 
BJS web, April 2012) (table 8). The number of persons admitted in 2013 
was 16 times the size of the average daily population (757,120) in 2013. 
Jurisdictions holding 500 or more inmates on an average day in 2013 
accounted for 54% of all new admissions to local jails. More than a third 
(35%) of the admissions were to the largest local jail jurisdictions 
holding 1,000 or more inmates. In comparison, jail jurisdictions holding 
fewer than 50 inmates accounted for about 7% of all admissions to local 
jails. Southern states accounted for more than half (52%) of all new 
admissions to local jails. Combined, Texas (10%), California (10%), and 
Florida (6%) accounted for a quarter of all new admissions to local jails 
(not shown). Each state had a larger number of admissions than the entire 
northeast region.

*******************************************
Expected length of stay in local jails 
was less than a month
*******************************************

The expected average length of stay for local jail inmates was 23 days in 
2013 (table 9). It was the highest (52 days) in the Northeast and lowest 
(19 days) in the Midwest. Among jurisdictions, the expected average 
length of stay was highest in the District of Columbia (70 days) and 
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts (67 days each). Excluding Alaska, the 
expected average length of stay was the lowest in Arkansas, Idaho, Iowa, 
North Dakota, Oregon, and South Dakota, (12 days each).

*******************************************
Facility bed capacity outpaced growth 
in the jail population
*******************************************

Local jails nationwide were less crowded at yearend 2013 (81% of rated 
capacity occupied) than in 1999 (93%) (table 10). The overall percentage 
of capacity occupied was highest in Virginia (119%) and West Virginia 
(102%) at yearend 2013. Excluding Alaska, the lowest occupied local jail 
space was reported in Wyoming (57%).

The rated capacity of local jails increased an estimated 39% or 252,550 
beds between 1999 and 2013, which was nearly twice the growth of the 
inmate population (up 21% or 125,630 inmates) (not shown). Facility 
expansion averaged 17,180 new spaces (up 2%) annually. Rated capacity is 
the maximum number of beds or inmates allocated to each jail facility by 
rating officials. Due to missing data in the 2006 Census of Jail 
Facilities, rated capacity data were not calculated.

Since 1999 jails in 35 states and the District of Columbia reported 
decreases in their occupied bed space, 7 states reported increases, and 3 
states remained relatively stable. North Dakota reported the largest 
increase in rated capacity occupied, from 64% in 1999 to 75% at yearend 
2013. The District of Columbia reported the largest decline in rated 
capacity occupied, from 120% in 1999 to 83% at yearend 2013.

*******************************************
Increase in correctional officers in the 
South outpaced growth in the inmate population
*******************************************

Approximately 173,900 correctional officers supervised 731,570 jail 
inmates at yearend 2013, up from an estimated 149,600 in 1999 (table 11). 
Local jail jurisdictions in the South employed the largest percentage 
(47%) of correctional officers, up from 44% in 1999. These jails also 
accounted for nearly half of the local jail inmate population nationwide. 
In southern local jails, the growth in the number of correctional 
officers outpaced the growth in their inmate population. For this report, 
correctional officers include deputies, monitors, and other custody staff 
who spend more than 50% of their time with the incarcerated population. 
Due to missing data in the 2006 Census of Jail Facilities, correctional 
officer data were not reported.

New York jails employed 6% of all local jail correctional officers in 
2013, down from 12% of all correctional officers in 1999. The decline in 
the number of correctional officers in New York outpaced the decline in 
the jail inmate population between 1999 and 2013 in the United States.

In the United States, nearly 7 in 10 correctional officers were male in 
both 1999 and 2013. Males accounted for 65% of the overall growth in 
correctional officers between 1999 and 2013. In 2013, Texas accounted for 
the largest proportion of all correctional officers (9%) and of all 
female correctional officers (10%). In Nebraska, Iowa, Alaska, and South 
Carolina jails, about 4 in 10 of all correctional officers were female in 
2013, while less than 20% of correctional officers in New Jersey, 
Washington,  Massachusetts, West Virginia, and New Hampshire were female.

The ratio of inmates to correctional officers was the highest in 
California, Mississippi, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Utah jails (about 
6 to 1) at yearend 2013. Excluding Alaska, the lowest ratio of inmates to 
correctional officers was reported in Maine (2.4 to 1). Five other states 
(Nebraska, Minnesota, New York, Iowa, and Massachusetts) also reported 
less than a 3 to 1 ratio of inmates to correctional officers at yearend 
2013.

*************************************************
*******************************************
The Impact of California’s 2011 Public 
Safety Realignment Policy on the California 
and national jail population
*******************************************

The total national jail population increased by 14,160 inmates from 
yearend 2011 to yearend 2013. The increase was attributed to 27 states 
that had a combined increase of about 30,490 inmates. The decline in 17 
states and the District of Columbia that had a combined decrease of 
16,330 inmates offset the increase in the jail population experienced by 
the other states. One state reported no change in their inmate 
population. 

From yearend 2011 to yearend 2013, the California jail population 
increased by 11,130 inmates. In comparison, the next closest states with 
an increase in jail population were Texas (3,140 inmates), Arkansas 
(1,840), Oklahoma (1,750), Mississippi (1,650), and North Carolina 
(1,500). The increase in the California jail population accounted for the 
majority of the total national jail inmate growth and significantly 
differs from recent national trends. The pivotal year of 2011 where the 
change in California jail population began to increase coincided with the 
implementation of the Public Safety Realignment Policy.

On May 23, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a ruling by a lower three-
judge court that the State of California must reduce its prison 
population to 137.5% of design capacity (by approximately 110,000 
prisoners) within 2 years to alleviate overcrowding. In response, the 
California State Legislature and governor enacted two laws—AB 109 and AB 
117—to reduce the number of inmates housed in state prisons beginning 
October 1, 2011.

The Public Safety Realignment Policy was designed to reduce the prison 
population through normal attrition of the existing population while 
placing new nonviolent, nonserious, nonsex offenders under county 
jurisdiction for incarceration in local jail facilities. Inmates released 
from local jails are placed under a county-directed post-release 
community supervision program instead of the state’s parole system.

From 1999 to 2013, the California jail inmate population increased by 
about 5,080 inmates (up 6.6%) (table 1). This increase included a 2.7% 
increase in California’s jail inmates from 1999 to 2006 and a 3.8% 
increase from March 31, 2006, to yearend 2013. In all other states, after 
a nearly 27% increase in the number of confined local jail inmates from 
1999 (528,801) to 2006 (669,004), the inmate population declined by about 
3% from 2006 to 2013. After a peak in the national jail population at 
midyear 2008, the jail population declined for the next 3 years until it 
increased 2.0% between yearend 2011 and yearend 2013 (table 12). The 
increase in the national jail population was largely driven by the 
increase in California’s jail population (up 15.7%).
*************************************************

****************
Federal jails
****************

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) maintains a small number of detention 
facilities that function as jails. These facilities were not included 
among the city, county, or regional adult detention facilities identified 
as local jails in this report. In 2013, BOP operated 12 jails that held 
11,864 persons (table 13). These numbers represent an increase from 11 
jails and 11,209 inmates in 1999, but a decrease from 13,806 persons in 
12 facilities in 2006 (not shown).

In 2013, 93% of federal jail inmates were male. Juveniles are not held in 
BOP jails. Hispanic inmates accounted for 52% of the total BOP jail 
population, blacks represented 25%, and whites represented 18% at yearend 
2013. Race data were not comparable between 1999 and 2013. 

The BOP jails admitted 38,109 persons during the 12-month period ending 
December 31, 2013. This number was 3 times the size of the average daily 
population (12,047) in 2013. The expected average length of stay for 
inmates held in federal detention centers was nearly 4 months. The peak 
population (the number of inmates held on the most crowded day in 
December 2013) was 12,668 inmates.

The 12 federal jails had a rated capacity of 9,877 in 2013, up from 11 
facilities with a rated capacity of 8,040 in 1999 (table 14). The rated 
capacity grew at a faster rate (up 23%) than the inmate population (up 
6%), resulting in a decline in the percent of capacity occupied, from 
139% in 1999 to 120% in 2013.

The number of BOP jail correctional officers increased 9%, from 1,685 in 
1999 to 1,838 in 2013. Eighty-one percent of BOP jail correctional 
officers in 2013 were male (table 15). Black correctional officers 
accounted for 37% of the total number of correctional officers, whites 
represented 29%, and Hispanics represented 27%. The inmate-to-
correctional officer ratio remained stable between 1999 (6.7 to 1) and 
2013 (6.5 to 1).

Methodology
*************

The Census of Jails is part of a series of data collections that study 
the nation’s local jails and periodically collect data from Federal 
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities that function as jails. The 2013 
Census of Jails was the tenth in a series of complete enumerations of 
jail facilities collected by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) since 
1970. The Census was conducted with a reference date of December 31, 2013 
***Footnote 1 This yearend reference date represents a change from the 
midyear reference date used for previous iterations of the Census of 
Jails and the corresponding Annual Survey of Jails (another BJS data 
collection)***. RTI International collected the data for BJS.

The census collected facility-level information on the number of confined 
and nonconfined inmates, number of inmates participating in weekend 
programs, number of confined non-U.S. citizens, number of confined 
inmates by sex and adult or juvenile status, number of juveniles held as 
adults, conviction and sentencing status, offense type, number of inmates 
held by race or Hispanic origin, number of inmates held for other 
jurisdictions or authorities, average daily population, rated capacity, 
number of admissions and releases, program participation for nonconfined 
inmates, operating expenditures, and staff by occupational category and 
race or Hispanic origin.

Because the census was a complete enumeration, the results were not 
subject to sampling error. However, the results were affected by unit and 
item nonresponse. The unit-level response rate for the census was 92.4%, 
and missing item-level data ranged from 0.5% to 15% for average daily 
population, inmate sex, inmate race or Hispanic origin, occupational 
category, jail programs, operating expenditures, and the rated capacity 
of individual jails. Complete or nearly complete reporting was recorded 
on the number of jail jurisdictions, number of jail facilities, and type 
of facility operator (public authority or under contract).

More information about the Census of Jails series is available on the BJS 
website.

Combined Census of Jails and Deaths in 
Custody Reporting Program data collections
*******************************************

To reduce respondent burden for the 2013 collection, the Census of Jails 
was combined with the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP). The 
DCRP is an annual BJS data collection that gathers national, state, and 
incident-level data on persons who died while in the physical custody of 
the 50 state departments of corrections or the approximately 2,900 local 
adult jail jurisdictions nationwide. The DCRP was authorized under the 
Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-297). It is the only 
national statistical collection that obtains comprehensive information 
about deaths in adult correctional facilities. BJS uses DCRP data to 
track national trends in the number and causes (or manners) of deaths 
that occur while a person is in state prison or local jail custody.

The DCRP data collection instruments are administered annually to both 
state prisons and local jails. Respondents provide an aggregate count of 
the number of deaths that occurred during the referenced calendar year. 
The jail (form CJ-9/CJ-10) and prison (form NPS-4A) survey instruments 
used to obtain data on each prison and jail death are available on the 
BJS website.

In addition to death counts, BJS requests that jails provide summary 
statistics about their population and admissions for the DCRP. All jails 
are asked to complete the annual summary form, including about 80% of 
jails in any given year that have no deaths to report.

For data collection year 2013, this annual summary form was redesigned to 
gather facility-level items on behalf of the Census of Jails data 
collection to (1) update and enhance the jail universe database to ensure 
full coverage of deaths in all jails nationwide, and (2) collect 
facility-level variables that can enhance and refine the denominators 
used in calculating mortality rates across jails. The combined Census of 
Jails and DCRP summary form focused on jail facilities rather than the 
DCRP’s usual jurisdiction-level data. The census data collection was 
carried out in conjunction with the DCRP data collection to minimize the 
contacts with and burden on those jail administrators who respond to the 
survey. The combined data collection was conducted primarily via web-
based data collection, with optional paper forms used as needed.

Included in the Census of Jails and 
DCRP data collections
*******************************************

The 2013 Census of Jails gathered data from all jail detention facilities 
holding inmates beyond arraignment, a period normally exceeding 72 hours. 
Included in the census were 2,872 local jail jurisdictions (including 77 
regional jails with 2 or more jail jurisdictions having a formal 
agreement to operate) made up of 3,163 city, county, or privately 
operated (39 facilities) jail facilities intended for adults ***Footnote 
2 Some facilities also held juveniles (defined as persons age 17 or 
younger*** and 12 BOP facilities that functioned as jails. In 2013, BJS 
counted the 12 BOP detention facilities as a single jurisdiction.

A jail jurisdiction is a legal entity that has responsibility for 
managing jail facilities. Jail jurisdictions typically operate at the 
county level, with a sheriff’s office or jail administrator managing the 
local facilities. The DCRP data identify the jail facility in which a 
jail inmate dies, but the data are arrayed at the jail jurisdiction 
level. BJS defines a jail as a locally operated correctional facility 
that confines persons before or after adjudication for more than 72 
hours, excluding temporary lockups. Typically, there is one facility per 
jail jurisdiction, but the 2013 Census of Jails found that 6.7% of jail 
jurisdictions had multiple facilities under a central authority *** 
Footnote 3 Approximately 15% of all facilities were part of a 
multifacility jurisdiction***.

Excluded from the Census of Jails and 
DCRP data collections
*******************************************

Excluded from the census were physically separate temporary holding 
facilities, such as drunk tanks and police lockups, that do not hold 
persons after they have been formally charged in court. Also excluded 
were state-operated facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, 
Rhode Island, and Vermont, which have combined jail and prison systems. 
However, the census did include 15 independently operated jails in 
Alaska.

Nonresponse
**************

The jail universe includes all jails currently operating and jails that 
have been contacted for the DCRP but have closed, consolidated, or 
otherwise ceased operations. This universe allows BJS to determine jail 
participation in the DCRP. The jail universe for the census was 
constructed in January 2014 and identified 2,872 jurisdictions consisting 
of 3,163 jail facilities. Of these, 2,923 facilities (92.4%) provided 
data to the Census of Jails and DCRP data collection using the annual 
summary form.

The congressionally mandated Death in Custody Reporting Act expired at 
yearend 2006, making participation in DCRP voluntary as of 2007. As a 
result, three jail jurisdictions no longer report data to the program.

Imputation and weighting
**************************

Imputation
------------

For responding jails that were unable to provide some requested items, a 
sequential hot-deck imputation procedure was used to impute values. This 
procedure, implemented using the SUDAAN software package, substitutes 
respondent (donor) data for missing values. The donor for each item 
nonrespondent was randomly selected from within a set of similar jails, 
which was sorted by related previous-year population values. The 
resulting imputed values are generally similar to the reported values of 
the previous year, but are not identical because of differences between 
each donor and item nonrespondent pairing and the year-to-year 
fluctuation in donor population values.

Weighting
************

Because the Census of Jails data collection used a census design (no 
sampling), each jail was initially self-representing and had a design 
weight of 1. To reduce nonresponse bias, responding jails had their 
weight adjusted via post-stratification to allow their responses to 
represent jails that did not respond. Control totals for the 2013 
confined population were estimated at the state level as follows:

* The year-to-year change in confined population among respondents to 
both the 2012 Deaths in Custody Reporting Program (DCRP) and the 2013 
Census of Jails was computed within the state.

* Plausible 2012 confined population values were imputed for jails that 
did not report to the DCRP in 2012 and did not report 2013 Census data 
using the hot-deck procedure described in the Imputation section.

* Estimated 2013 values were calculated by multiplying the yearly change 
rate and the 2012 DCRP estimate of confined population for jails not 
responding to the 2013 Census the sum of reported, item-imputed, and 
DCRP-estimated values for the 2013 confined population for each state 
served as the control totals for the post-stratification procedure.

The post-stratification weight adjustment factor was identical for all 
jails within a state and was computed as the ratio of the control total 
for state i to the sum of the reported and item-imputed 2013 Census of 
Jails confined population values for state i:

The final analysis weight is the product of the design weight and the 
post-stratification adjustment factor. Because the design weight was 1 
for all jails, the analysis weight is equal to the adjustment factor.

Methodology for 2011
*************************

The response rate for the 2011 yearend population was 96.8%. The 2011 
jail population in table 12 was estimated for 93 reporting units that did 
not respond to the data collection efforts of 2011 Deaths in Custody 
Program (DCRP)—Annual Summary on Inmates Under Jail Jurisdiction. 
Estimates for the 2011 yearend population were derived from data covering 
2009, 2010, and 2012. Reporting units that responded to both the 2012 
DCRP and at least one of the 2009 or 2010 DCRP collections (70 of the 93 
nonrespondents) had their 2011 data estimated by linear interpolation. 
When linear interpolation was not possible (23 of the 93 nonrespondents), 
the most recent yearend count available was used to estimate the 2011 
yearend count.
