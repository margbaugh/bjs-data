During the 12 months ending June 30, 2006, the number of
inmates in the custody of State and Federal prisons and local 
jails increased 2.8% to reach 2,245,189. From midyear 2005 to 
midyear 2006, inmates in State prisons increased 3.0%; Federal
prisons, 3.2%; and local jails, 2.5%. The increase in the 
number of inmates in State or Federal custody accounted for 
about 70% of the growth in the total custody population. 

In the 12-month period ending June 30, 2006, the number of
prisoners under the jurisdiction of State or Federal 
correctional authorities increased by 2.8% to reach 1,556,518. 
In both absolute numbers and percent change, the increase was 
the largest since midyear 2000. Jurisdiction refers to the 
legal authority of a State or Federal correctional system over 
a prisoner, regardless of the location or type of facility 
where the prisoner is housed. Four jurisdictions -- the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons, California, Texas, and Florida -- accounted 
for 52% of the increase in the jurisdiction population. 

Prison admissions increased at a faster rate than releases,
resulting in prison population growth. During calendar year 
2005 (the most recent data available), State and Federal 
correctional authorities admitted 733,009 prisoners and 
released 698,459. The number of admissions during 2005 was 
4.7% larger than the number admitted during 2004 (699,812), 
while the number of releases (672,202) increased by 3.9% 
during that period. 

For the 12 months ending June 30, 2006, State systems
reported a larger increase than the Federal system in the 
number of inmates housed in private prisons. State prisoners 
held in private prisons increased by 12.9% to reach 84,867. 
Federal prisoners in private facilities increased by 2.1% to
reach 27,108. The Federal system housed a larger share of
prisoners in private facilities (14.2%)than the State systems 
(6.2%).

The number of female prisoners rose at a faster rate than the
number of male prisoners. Between midyear 2005 and 2006, the 
female prison population increased by 4.8% to reach 111,403. 
In the same period, the male prison population increased by 
2.7% to reach 1,445,115. 

On June 30, 2006, an estimated 4.8% of black men were in
prison or jail, compared to 1.9% of Hispanic men and 0.7% of 
white men. More than 11% of black males age 25 to 34 were
incarcerated. Black women were incarcerated in prison or jail
at nearly 4 times the rate of white women and more than twice 
the rate of Hispanic women. 

Additional data in appendix tables are available on the BJS
Web site at <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov.bjs/pub/pdf/pjim06.pdf>.

Prison incarceration rate reaches 496 per 100,000 U.S.
residents

At midyear 2006, 496 prisoners per 100,000 U.S. residents
were incarcerated in State or Federal prison, up from 488 at 
midyear 2005. Ten States exceeded the national incarceration 
rate, led by Louisiana (835 per 100,000 residents), Texas 
(687), and Mississippi (661). Six States had rates that were 
less than half the national rate, with the lowest rates in
Maine (141 per 100,000 residents), Rhode Island (195), and
New Hampshire (200). 

Prison authorities reported largest increase in number 
of prisoners since midyear 1999 to 2000 

On June 30, 2006, State and Federal prison authorities had
jurisdiction over 1,556,518 prisoners, an increase of 2.8% 
(42,552) from midyear 2005.***Footnote 1: The jurisdiction 
population includes jail inmates who are under the legal 
authority of State or Federal correctional systems.*** This 
was the largest absolute increase since the 1999 to 2000 
increase of 51,931 prisoners (table 2). Within the State 
prison systems, the growth in the number of prisoners during 
the 6 months from December 31, 2005, to June 30, 2006 (2.0%), 
was faster than growth during the period from June 30, 2005, 
to December 31, 2005 (0.7%). Within the Federal system, 
growth was about the same during each 6-month period. 

Most of the increase (84.5%) in the total prison population
was due to growth in prisoners under State jurisdiction 
(up 35,956). The 2.7% increase in State prisoners from midyear 
2005 to midyear 2006 reversed a 3-year trend of declining 
growth rates. Similarly, the 3.6% increase in Federal prisoners 
reversed a period of declining growth rates from midyear 1999 
to midyear 2005, when the annual growth rate declined steadily
from 9.6% to 2.9%.

Three jurisdictions responsible for a third of State and
Federal prisoners at midyear 2006 

The three largest jurisdictions -- the Federal system,
California, and Texas -- accounted for more than a third 
(539,084 prisoners) of all prisoners under State or Federal 
jurisdiction on June 30, 2006. The Federal system had 12.3% 
of the total prison population under its jurisdiction; 
California, 11.3%; and Texas, 11.1%. The seven largest 
jurisdictions accounted for over half of prisoners under 
State or Federal jurisdiction. The 21 smallest jurisdictions 
accounted for 7.8% of the total population under jurisdiction 
at midyear 2006.

Four jurisdictions accounted for more than half of the
increase in the prison population

Four jurisdictions (California, the Federal system, Georgia,
and Florida) accounted for more than half of the increase in 
the jurisdiction population during the 12-month period ending 
June 30, 2006. California contributed 20% of the total increase 
in prisoners; the Federal system, 15%; Georgia, 9%; and 
Florida, 8%. The increase in these jurisdictions -- along 
with increases in Ohio, Arizona, Michigan, Texas, and 
Pennsylvania -- accounted for three-quarters of the total 
change in the jurisdiction population between midyear 2005 and 
2006.

Prison populations increased in 43 jurisdictions;
8 jurisdictions had no growth or declined

In the 12 months ending June 30, 2006, the percentage change
in prison population by jurisdiction ranged from -2.9% in 
Missouri to 9.4% in Alaska. The prison population in 43
jurisdictions grew, while 8 had no growth or declined. 

Of the 5 jurisdictions with the largest percentage increase
in prisoners, 4 ranked among the 20 having the smallest 
prison population, and 1 (Georgia) ranked among the 10 largest 
jurisdictions. 

Prison admissions outpaced releases, resulting in 
population growth

During calendar year 2005, State and Federal correctional
authorities admitted 733,009 prisoners into their systems, 
an increase of 4.7% over the number admitted during 2004. 
(The 2005 calendar year data were the most recent data 
available.) 
 
States admitted 676,952 prisoners during 2005 which represented 
a 4.7% increase (30,122 admissions) over the number admitted 
during 2004. While 34 States had an increase in the number of 
admissions during 2005, three States accounted for over half 
of the total growth in admissions to State prison: Florida (up 
6,145 admissions), California (up 6,022), and Texas (up 5,006). 
Federal prisons admitted 56,057 prisoners during 2005, an
increase of 3,075 or 5.8% from 2004. 

The number of releases from State or Federal jurisdiction also 
increased during 2005, but at a slightly slower pace than 
admissions. State and Federal authorities released 698,459 
prisoners during 2005, up 3.9% from the number in 2004. 

Growth in admissions driven by new court 
commitments and returned parole violators

Between 2000 and 2005, the number of new court commitments to
State prison increased by 20.3%, while the number of parole 
violators who were revoked and returned to prison increased
by 14.1%. During 2005, the number of new court commitments
increased at a lower rate (2.5%)than the number of returned 
parole violators (6.0%).

States increased the use of private prisons more 
rapidly than the Federal system

On June 30, 2006, the number of State and Federal prisoners
housed in private facilities reached 111,975, an increase of 
10,255 prisoners (or 10.1%) since midyear 2005. State 
prisoners held in private facilities increased 12.9%; those 
under Federal jurisdiction increased 2.1%. The proportion of 
all prisoners under State or Federal jurisdiction housed in 
privately operated facilities reached 7.2% at midyear 2006, 
up from 6.5% in 2003.

Texas, Indiana, Colorado, and Florida accounted for more than
half of the increase in prisoners held in private facilities 
between midyear 2005 and 2006. With an additional 2,806 
prisoners in private facilities, Texas accounted for 27.3% 
percent of the total increase.

Jurisdictions varied in their use of private facilities. At
midyear 2006, 19 jurisdictions reported housing no prisoners 
in private facilities. Six jurisdictions held at least a
quarter of their inmates in privately operated facilities,
led by New Mexico (43%), Wyoming (38%) and Hawaii (30%). 

Number of persons under age 18 in State custody 
increased at midyear 2006

During the 12 months ending June 30, 2006, the number of
juveniles in State prisons increased by 156 persons to reach 
2,364, a 7.1% increase. This is the first annual increase in 
the number of persons under age 18 since 1995. Between 1995 
and 2006, the number of juveniles declined 55%, from 5,309 
to 2,208 (not shown in table).

All but seven States housed at least one juvenile prisoner.
Five States -- Connecticut (425), New York (219), Florida 
(221), North Carolina (188), and Texas (162)-- accounted 
for more than half of all juveniles held in State prisons. 

Little change in noncitizens in State or Federal prisons 

State and Federal prisons held 91,426 noncitizens on June 30,
2006, an increase of 337 prisoners (or 0.4%) over 12 months. 
More than two-thirds of the noncitizens in State or Federal 
prison were held by three jurisdictions: the Federal system 
housed 33,701 (37% of the total); California housed 15,849 
(17% of the total); and Texas housed 9,227(10% of the total).

Female prisoners continued to rise faster than male 
prisoners

Between midyear 2005 and 2006, the percent increase in female
prisoners under the jurisdiction of State or Federal 
authorities was almost twice that of male prisoners. The female 
prison population increased 4.6% to reach 111,403, while the 
male prison population increased 2.7% to reach 1,445,115.

This growth is part of a larger trend between 2000 and 2006,
when the female prison population grew 3.3% on average, 
compared to a 2.0% growth in the male prison population. 
Women made up 7.2% of the prison population on June 30, 2006, 
compared to 6.1% at yearend 1995 (not shown in table). 

At midyear 2006 men were 14 times more likely than women to
be incarcerated. Their rate of incarceration was 939 men per 
100,000 males, compared to 67 women per 100,000 females. 

Local jail population growth slowed from midyear 2005 
to 2006

Between July 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006, the number of persons 
held in local jails increased 2.5% to reach 766,010 inmates, 
the slowest growth since the 1.6% increase in midyear 2001. 
The growth in the jail population was largely due to an 
additional 14,522 adult male inmates who made up 78.5% of the 
total change in the jail population. 

Similar to the prison population, the number of adult females
in local jails grew at a faster rate (4.9%) than the number 
of adult males (2.2%). From 2000 to 2006, the number of adult 
females in local jails increased by 40%, compared to 22% in 
adult males. 

The number of juveniles held in adult jails declined by 1.0%
(or 655 inmates). Juveniles held as adults dropped 16% in the 
12 months ending June 30, 2006, but the number held as 
juveniles increased by 26%. Overall, the number of juveniles 
held in local jails decreased 20% between 2000 and 2006. 

At midyear 2006 local jails held 256 inmates per 100,000 U.S.
residents, up from 252 at midyear 2005. The 1.6% increase in 
the incarceration rate continued a pattern of annual growth, 
but was less than half the 3.7% increase experienced from 
midyear 2004 to 2005.

The jail incarceration rate varied by gender and race. Males
(457 per 100,000) were incarcerated at about 7 times the rate 
of females (66 per 100,000). About 1 in every 219 males in 
the U.S. resident population was held in a local jail at 
midyear 2006, compared to 1 in every 1,515 females. Based on 
administrative records' designation of race and Hispanic 
origin, blacks were incarcerated at 4.8 times the rate of 
whites. About 1 in every 123 blacks were incarcerated on June 
30, 2006, compared to 1 in every 353 Hispanics and 1 in every 
588 whites. 

Characteristics of jail inmates changed slightly 

In the 12 months ending June 30, 2006, characteristics of 
inmates in local jails changed slightly. The reported 
percentage of females increased by 0.2% to reach 12.9% of all 
jail inmates. The respective percentages of white, black, 
convicted, and unconvicted jail inmates on June 30, 2006, 
were comparable to their percentages at midyear 2005. 

From 2000 to 2006 the number of females in local jails
increased from 11.4% to 12.9% of the jail inmate population. 
Whites increased from 41.9% to 43.9%, and blacks decreased 
from 41.3% to 38.6%. The percentage of jail inmates who were 
convicted declined from 44% to 37.9%. 

Jail capacity expanded with the growth of the jail 
inmate population

Total rated capacity of local jails at midyear 2006 reached
810,863 beds, an increase of 2.8%. Rated capacity is the 
maximum number of beds or inmates allocated by State or local 
rating officials to each jail facility. On June 30, 2006, 
local jails nationwide operated at an average of 94% of rated 
capacity. Based on the peak number of inmates incarcerated on 
a given day during the year, local jails nationwide operated 
at 100% of rated capacity. 

The smallest jail jurisdictions (those with an average daily
population of fewer than 50 inmates) generally had a lower 
percent of capacity occupied. Jurisdictions with larger 
average daily populations generally met or exceeded their 
capacity. 

Local jail officials collectively added jail capacity at a
rate about equal to the rate of growth in the jail inmate 
population. Between 1995 and 2006, the jail population and 
rated capacity both increased steadily, although during some 
periods the rates of increase in population and capacity
varied. Between 1998 and 2001, capacity expanded more rapidly
than did the jail population, and the average percentage of 
rated capacity used declined slightly, from about 97% to 
about 90%. After 2002 jail populations increased at a slightly 
faster rate than rated capacity, and the percentage of rated 
capacity used by local jails increased to 94% by 
2006.***Footnote 2: On December 31, 2005, State prison systems 
were between operating 1% below and 14% above capacity. The 
Federal prison system was operating at 34% above capacity. 
See Prisoners in 2005, November 2006, NCJ 215092.***

A small number of large jail jurisdictions held majority of
all jail inmates

At midyear 2006, 5.6% of jurisdictions had average daily jail
populations of 1,000 or more inmates. These jurisdictions held 
50% of the nation's jail population. By comparison, 39.5% of
jurisdictions had an average daily jail population of fewer
than 50 inmates and held 3.1% of the nation's jail population.

The Nation's 50 largest jail jurisdictions accounted for less
than 2% of all jurisdictions but held 29.5% of all jail inmates 
on June 30, 2006. The two largest jail jurisdictions -- Los 
Angeles County and New York City -- held 32,703 inmates, or 
4.3% of all jail inmates.

In the 12-month period ending June 30, 2006, jail populations
in the 50 largest jail jurisdictions increased 1.3%. Among 
these jurisdictions, 29 experienced jail inmate population 
increases, with the largest percentage increase occurring in 
Fresno County, California, up 22.2%. Twenty of the 50 largest 
jurisdictions experienced declines in jail inmate populations. 
The largest decrease occurred in Hillsborough County, Florida, 
down 16.9%.

More than 60,000 jail inmates supervised outside of jail
facilities

On June 30, 2006, jail officials reported supervising 60,222
offenders in alternative programs outside of jail facilities. 
These offenders made up 7.3% of the total 826,232 offenders 
either in custody in jails or under supervision in the 
community by local jail officials. Offenders in community 
service(14,667), weekender programs(11,421), and on electronic
monitoring (10,999) comprised the largest number of persons
under supervision in the community. 

Total number of inmates in custody of prison or jail
authorities increased by 2.8% 

During the 12 months ending midyear 2006, the total number 
of inmates in the custody of State and Federal prisons and 
in local jails increased by 2.8% to reach 2,245,189 inmates. 
This increase was smaller than the average annual growth 
rate of 3.4% percent from midyear 2000 to midyear 2006. 

The growth of inmates in different facilities varied. The
number of inmates in Federal prisons increased by 3.2% from 
midyear 2005 to midyear 2006; those in local jails increased 
by 2.6%, and those in State prisons increased by 3.0%. 

One in every 133 U.S. residents in prison or jail at 
midyear 2006

At midyear 2006, 750 persons per 100,000 U.S. residents were
in prison or jail, the equivalent to 1 in every 133 residents. 
This is an increase from 744 persons in prison or jail per 
100,000 residents at midyear 2005.  
 
Increase in local jail inmates was a third of the total
increase in total custody population 

In the 12 months ending June 30, 2006, the increase in the 
jail population accounted for 30% of the change in the 
population of inmates in custody, while the increase in the 
number of prisoners in State or Federal facilities accounted 
for 70%. By comparison, during the 12 months ending June 30, 
2005 (the prior 12-month period), change in the local jail 
population accounted for 70% of the change in the custody 
population, while change in the number of inmates in State 
and Federal prisons accounted for 30% of the change in the 
total custody population.

With one exception, jail population growth accounted for
successively larger proportions of the change in the total 
custody population during each of the years from 2000 to 
2005. The exception was during the 12 months ending on June 
30, 2004. Between 2000 and 2005, the proportion of the 
change in the custody population due to change in the jail 
population increased from about 35% to 70%. 

Black males in their late twenties incarcerated at 
higher rates than other groups

At midyear 2006 more black men (836,800) were in custody in
State or Federal prison or local jail than white men 
(718,100) or Hispanic men (426,900). Black men comprised 41% 
of the more than 2 million men in custody, and black men age 
20 to 29 comprised 15.5% of all men in custody on June 30, 
2006. 

Relative to their numbers in the general population, about 4.8% 
of all black men were in custody at midyear 2006, compared to 
about 0.7% of white men and 1.9% of Hispanic men. Overall,
black men were incarcerated at 6.5 times the rate of white
men. The incarceration rate for black men was highest among 
black men age 25 to 29. About 11.7% of black males in this age 
group were incarcerated on June 30, 2006. Across age groups 
black men were between 5.7 and 8.5 times more likely than 
white men to be incarcerated. 

Among female offenders, more white women (95,300) than black
women (68,800) or Hispanic women (32,400) were in custody. 
White women comprised 47% of the female population in
custody at midyear 2006.

In general females had a lower incarceration rate than males.
White females had a lower incarceration rate (94 per 100,000 
white women) than black females (358 per 100,000 black women) 
and Hispanic females (152 per 100,000 Hispanic women). The 
overall incarceration rate for black women was 3.8 times the 
rate for white women. Hispanic women were 1.6 times more likely 
than white women to be incarcerated. Across age groups black 
women were incarcerated between 2.8 and 4.3 times the rate of 
white women.

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), with the U.S. Census
Bureau as its collection agent, obtains midyear and yearend 
counts of prisoners from the departments of corrections in 
the 50 States and from the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

The National Prisoner Statistics(NPS)distinguishes prisoners 
in custody from those under jurisdiction. To have custody of 
a prisoner, a correctional agency must hold that person in one 
of its facilities. To have jurisdiction means that an entity 
has legal authority over a prisoner. Prisoners under a State's 
jurisdiction may be in the custody of a local jail, another 
State's prison, or in another correctional facility. Some 
States are unable to provide jurisdiction counts. 

NPS counts exclude persons confined in locally administered
facilities (jails) and who are under the jurisdiction of local 
authorities. NPS counts include all inmates in State-operated 
facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode 
Island, and Vermont, which have combined prison-jail systems. 
NPS exclude inmates held by the District of Columbia, which as 
of yearend 2001 operated only a jail system. 

Annual Survey of Jails, 2006

In each year between the years that BJS conducts a complete
census of local jails, BJS conducts the Annual Survey of 
Jails (ASJ), a sample survey of local jails which is used to 
estimate the number and characteristics of local inmates 
nationwide. For the 2006 ASJ, the U.S. Census Bureau, as 
collection agent, drew a sample of 874 jurisdictions and 936 
jail facilities. Local jail jurisdictions include counties 
(parishes in Louisiana) or municipal governments that 
administer one or more local jails. 
  
The 2006 ASJ sample included all jails operated jointly by
two or more jurisdictions, multi-jurisdictional jails, with 
certainty (63). Other jail jurisdictions included with 
certainty (269)were those that(1) held juveniles inmates at 
the time of the 2005 Census of Jail Inmates and that had an 
average daily population of 500 or more inmates during the 
12 months ending June 30, 2005, or (2) held only adults and 
the average daily inmate population was 750 or more.

The remaining jurisdictions were stratified into two groups:
jurisdictions with jails holding at least one juvenile on 
June 30, 2005, and jails hold only adults on that date. Using 
stratified random sampling, 542 jurisdictions were selected 
from 8 strata based upon the two conditions enumerated above 
and 4 strata based upon their average daily jail inmate 
population during 2005. The average daily jail inmate population 
was derived from the 2005 Census of Jail Inmates.

Data were obtained from sampled jurisdictions by mail-out and
web-based survey questionnaires. After follow-up phone calls 
to respondents, the response rate for the survey was 100% for 
critical items such as the number of inmates confined, average 
daily population, and rated capacity. (See Appendix tables 10, 
11, and 12 for standard errors associated with reported 
estimates from the ASJ 2006 at
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/pjim06.htm>.)
