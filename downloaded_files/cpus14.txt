Bulletin

Correctional Populations in the United States, 2014 

Danielle Kaeble, Lauren Glaze, Anastasios Tsoutis, 
and Todd Minton, BJS Statisticians

At yearend 2014, an estimated 6,851,000 persons were under the 
supervision of U.S. adult correctional systems, a decline of 
about 52,200 from 6,903,200 at yearend 2013 (figure 1). After 
peaking at 7,339,600 persons in 2007, the correctional population 
decreased each year by an average of 1.0%. By yearend 2014, the 
population declined by 0.8% to the lowest level observed in more 
than a decade (6,886,800 in 2003). About 1 in 36 adults in the 
United States was under some form of correctional supervision at 
yearend 2014. This was the lowest rate observed since 1996 
(5,531,300) when about 1.3 million fewer offenders were under 
correctional supervision (not shown).

This report summarizes data from several Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (BJS) correctional data collections to provide 
statistics on the total population supervised by adult 
correctional systems in the United States. (See Methodology for 
sources.) These systems include offenders living in the community 
while supervised by probation or parole agencies and those under 
the jurisdiction of state or federal prisons or held in local 
jails. (See Terms and definitions for more information.)

HIGHLIGHTS
*************

* Adult correctional systems supervised an estimated 6,851,000 
persons at yearend 2014, about 52,200 fewer offenders than at 
yearend 2013.

* About 1 in 36 adults (or 2.8% of adults in the United States) 
was under some form of correctional supervision at yearend 2014, 
the lowest rate since 1996.

* The correctional population has declined by an annual average 
of 1.0% since 2007. 

* The community supervision population (down 1.0%) continued to 
decline during 2014, accounting for all of the decrease in the 
correctional population.

* The incarcerated population (up 1,900) slightly increased 
during 2014. 

* Between 2007 and 2014, about 88% of the decrease in the 
correctional population (down 488,600 offenders) was attributed 
to the decline in the probation population.

* Seven jurisdictions accounted for almost half (48%) of the U.S. 
correctional population at yearend 2014.

* Nearly all (47) jurisdictions had a larger proportion of their 
correctional population supervised in the community at yearend 
2014 than incarcerated in prison or local jail.

***********************************************
The community supervision population declined 
during 2014, accounting for all of the decrease 
in the correctional population
***********************************************

From 2013 (6,903,200) to 2014 (6,851,000), the total correctional 
population declined by 0.8% (table 1). (See appendix tables 1, 2, 
and 3 for correctional population estimates by jurisdiction and 
sex.) About 7 in 10 persons under correctional supervision at 
yearend 2014 were supervised in the community either on probation 
(3,864,100) or parole (856,900).***Footnote 1 The total 
correctional population, total community supervision population, 
and total incarcerated population exclude offenders with multiple 
correctional statuses to avoid double counting. For this reason, 
the sum of the community supervision and incarcerated 
populations, and the change in the populations, will not equal 
the total correctional population. See table 6 and 
Methodology.*** In comparison, about 3 in 10 offenders 
(2,224,400) under correctional supervision were under the 
jurisdiction of state or federal prisons (1,561,500) or held in 
local jails (744,600).

The 52,200 decrease in the number of persons under correctional 
supervision during 2014 was attributed to a decline in the 
community supervision population (down 1.0%), as the change in 
the incarcerated population during the year was small (up 0.1%). 
All of the decrease in the community supervision population 
during 2014 was accounted for by the decline in the probation 
population (down 46,500), as the parole population increased 
slightly during the year (up 1,700).

After reaching a high of 5,119,000 persons in 2007, the community 
supervision population declined by annual average of 1.2%. The 
downward trend in the probation population over the past 7 years 
was consistent with that of the community supervision population. 
Since 2007, the probation population declined by an annual 
average of 1.5%, the largest rate of decline across all 
correctional populations. In comparison, the parole population 
grew by an annual average of 0.5% since 2007.

During 2014, the number of inmates incarcerated in state or 
federal prisons or local jails increased slightly (up 1,900), 
reversing a 5-year decline since 2008. While the jail population 
grew by 1.8% during 2014, the U.S. prison population dropped by 
1.0%. The decrease in the U.S. prison population resulted from a 
decline in the state (down 10,100) and federal (down 5,300) 
prison populations. This was the second consecutive decline in 
the federal prison population after peaking in 2012 (217,800).

***********************************************
During 2014, the correctional supervision rate 
fell for the seventh consecutive year
***********************************************

By yearend 2014, about 2,780 offenders per 100,000 U.S. adult 
residents were under some form of correctional supervision, down 
from 2,830 per 100,000 adults at yearend 2013 (figure 2). More 
than half (56%) of the decline in the correctional supervision 
rate was attributed to the increase in the size of the U.S. adult 
resident population during the year, while a smaller share of the 
decline (44%) resulted from the decrease in the correctional 
population. (See Methodology.) 

After peaking at 3,210 per 100,000 U.S. adult residents in 2007, 
the correctional supervision rate fell steadily each year. Since 
2007, the trend in the correctional supervision rate diverged 
from the trend in the number of persons under correctional 
supervision. The number of persons supervised by adult 
correctional systems decreased by an annual average of 1.0% from 
yearend 2007 to 2014. In comparison, the average annual decline 
in the correctional supervision rate (down 2.1%) was twice as 
fast during the same period. However, more than half (52%) of the 
decrease in the correctional supervision rate resulted from the 
increase in the U.S. adult resident population since 2007, 
compared to 48% of the decline attributed to the decrease in the 
number of offenders under correctional supervision. 

From 2013 to 2014, the rate of offenders under community 
supervision declined from 1,950 to 1,910 per 100,000 adults, 
continuing a downward trend since 2007 (table 2). The decrease in 
the community supervision rate over the past 7 years accounted 
for about three-quarters of the decline in the correctional 
supervision rate during the period. The incarceration rate also 
dropped slightly by yearend 2014, from 910 per 100,000 at yearend 
2013 to 900 per 100,000. The incarceration rate has declined 
steadily each year since 2008.

**************************************************************

***********************************************
The difference between measures of the 
incarceration rate and the imprisonment rate
***********************************************

The incarceration rate and the imprisonment rate are two 
different statistics that BJS reports, depending on the 
correctional population of interest. The incarceration rate 
describes the incarcerated population that consists of inmates 
under the jurisdiction of state or federal prisons and inmates 
held in local jails. In comparison, the imprisonment rate 
describes the prison population under the jurisdiction of state 
or federal prisons and sentenced to more than 1 year. The 
imprisonment rate excludes prisoners who are unsentenced, those 
with sentences of less than 1 year, and all local jail inmates. 
Given these differences, the incarceration rate will always be 
higher than the imprisonment rate because the imprisonment rate 
includes only a subset of the population accounted for in the 
incarceration rate (table 3). 

This report focuses on the total correctional population, which 
consists of the community supervision (i.e., probation and 
parole) and incarcerated (i.e., prison and local jail) 
populations. Therefore, except for table 3, rates presented in 
this report are incarceration rates because they describe the 
total incarcerated population. BJS reports on the imprisonment 
rates in its annual report on the prison population. For more 
information on imprisonment rates, see Prisoners in 2014 (NCJ 
248955, BJS web, September 2015).
**************************************************************

***********************************************
Since 2007, compositional changes in the 
correctional population were small despite 
the decrease of 488,900 offenders
***********************************************

Despite the overall decline in the correctional population over 
the past 7 years (down 488,900 offenders), the changes in the 
composition of the population were small. Probationers continued 
to account for the majority (56%) of offenders under correctional 
supervision at yearend 2014 (table 4). In 2014, probationers 
accounted for a slightly smaller portion of the correctional 
population compared to 2007 (58%), as the number of probationers 
decreased each year during the period.

Prison and parole populations grew slightly as a share of the 
total correctional population between 2007 and 2014. Prisoners 
accounted for 23% of offenders under correctional supervision at 
yearend 2014, up slightly from 22% in 2007. The parole population 
accounted for 13% of the correctional population at the end of 
2014, up slightly from 11% in 2007. Inmates incarcerated in local 
jails represented the smallest shares of the correctional 
population in 2007 and 2014 (11% each). 

***********************************************
The decline in the probation population from 
2007 to 2014 accounted for 88% of the decrease
in the correctional population
***********************************************

Probationers represented the majority of offenders under 
correctional supervision from 2007 to 2014, and the decline in 
this population contributed significantly to the decrease in the 
correctional population. From 2007 to 2014, the number of 
probationers decreased by 428,800, representing about 88% of the 
total decline in the correctional population since 2007—the 
largest decline among all correctional populations (table 5). 
 
The prison and local jail populations also declined between 2007 
and 2014. However, they accounted for a significantly smaller 
portion of the decrease in the correctional population compared 
to probationers. From 2007 to 2014, the number of inmates in 
prison declined by 35,300 offenders and the number in local jails 
fell by 35,600, accounting for equal shares of the decline in the 
correctional population (down 7% each). 

The parole population was the only correctional population to 
increase from 2007 to 2014. About 30,800 more parolees were 
supervised in the community in 2014 compared to 2007, partially 
offsetting the overall decline in the correctional population 
during the 7-year period.

***********************************************
Seven jurisdictions accounted for almost half 
of the U.S. correctional population at yearend 
2014
***********************************************

At yearend 2014, the size of the correctional population by 
jurisdiction varied, from a low of 8,400 offenders to a high of 
699,300 (figure 3). Including the federal system but excluding 
the District of Columbia, the average number of offenders under 
the supervision of adult correctional systems by jurisdiction was 
about 133,400. Seven jurisdictions had correctional populations 
of 300,000 or more offenders, including Texas (699,300), 
California (589,600), Georgia (579,600), Florida (382,600), 
Pennsylvania (360,800), the federal system (338,000), and Ohio 
(326,300). These seven jurisdictions made up almost half (48%) of 
the U.S. correctional population at the end of 2014.

Excluding the federal system, four of the same six jurisdictions 
had more than 3,000 per 100,000 U.S. adult residents under some 
form of correctional supervision at yearend 2014 (figure 4). The 
other two states, Florida (2,390 per 100,000 U.S. adult 
residents) and California (1,980 per 100,000), had correctional 
supervision rates that were less than 2,500 per 100,000. 

***********************************************
At yearend 2014, almost all jurisdictions had 
a larger portion of their correctional population 
supervised in the community than incarcerated 
***********************************************

While the distribution of the correctional population varied by 
jurisdiction, almost all (47) jurisdictions had more than half of 
their correctional population supervised in the community on 
probation or parole at the end of 2014. Including the federal 
system but excluding the District of Columbia, jurisdictions 
ranged from a low of 38% of their correctional population 
supervised in the community at yearend 2014 to a high of 88%, 
with a national average of about 66% (figure 5). The proportion 
of the correctional population incarcerated in state or federal 
prisons or local jails ranged from a low of 12% to a high of 62%, 
with a national average of about 34%. 

Of the seven jurisdictions that constituted almost half of the 
U.S. correctional population at yearend 2014, six had at least 
60% of their correctional population supervised in the community 
rather than incarcerated. These included Georgia (84% of total 
correctional population in the community), Ohio (78%), 
Pennsylvania (77%), Texas (69%), California (65%), and Florida 
(60%). One of the seven jurisdictions, the federal system (62%), 
had more than 60% of its correctional population incarcerated 
rather than supervised in the community at the end of the year.

Terms and definitions
*************************

Adult--persons subject to the jurisdiction of an adult criminal 
court or correctional agency. Adults are age 18 or older in most 
jurisdictions. Persons age 17 or younger who were prosecuted in 
criminal court as if they were adults are considered adults, but 
persons age 17 or younger who were under the jurisdiction of a 
juvenile court or agency are excluded. (See Methodology for more 
information on prison and local jail inmates age 17 or younger.)

Annual change—change in a population between two consecutive 
years. 

Average annual change--average (mean) annual change in a 
population across a specific time period. 

Community supervision population--estimated number of persons 
living in the community while supervised on probation or parole. 

Community supervision rate--estimated number of persons 
supervised in the community on probation or parole per 100,000 
U.S. residents of all ages (i.e., total community supervision 
rate) or U.S. residents age 18 or older (i.e., adult community 
supervision rate).

Correctional population--estimated number of persons living in 
the community while supervised on probation or parole and inmates 
under the jurisdiction of state or federal prisons or held in 
local jails.

Correctional supervision rate--estimated number of persons 
supervised in the community on probation or parole and inmates 
under the jurisdiction of state or federal prisons or held in 
local jails per 100,000 U.S. residents of all ages (i.e., total 
correctional supervision rate) or U.S. residents age 18 or older 
(i.e., adult correctional supervision rate).
Imprisonment rate--estimated number of prisoners under state or 
federal jurisdiction sentenced to more than 1 year per 100,000 
U.S. residents of all ages (i.e., total imprisonment rate) or 
U.S. residents age 18 or older (i.e., adult imprisonment rate). 
(The imprisonment rate is presented and discussed in The 
difference between measures of the incarceration rate and 
imprisonment rate text box.)

Incarcerated population--estimated number of inmates under the 
jurisdiction of state or federal prisons or held in local jails.

Incarceration rate--estimated number of inmates under the 
jurisdiction of state or federal prisons or held in local jails 
per 100,000 U.S. residents of all ages (i.e., total incarceration 
rate) or U.S. residents age 18 or older (i.e., adult 
incarceration rate).

Indian country jail population--estimated number of inmates held 
in correctional facilities operated by tribal authorities or the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S. Department of the Interior. 
These facilities include confinement facilities, detention 
centers, jails, and other facilities operated by tribal 
authorities or the BIA. (This estimate is presented in appendix 
table 4.)

Local jail population--estimated number of inmates held in a 
confinement facility usually administered by a local law 
enforcement agency that is intended for adults, but sometimes 
holds juveniles, for confinement before and after adjudication. 
These facilities include jails and city or county correctional 
centers; special jail facilities, such as medical treatment or 
release centers; halfway houses; work farms; and temporary 
holding or lockup facilities that are part of the jail’s combined 
function. Inmates sentenced to jail facilities usually have a 
sentence of 1 year or less. 

Military prison population--estimated number of service personnel 
incarcerated under the jurisdiction of U.S. military correctional 
authorities. (This estimate is presented in appendix table 4.)

Parole population--estimated number of persons who are on 
conditional release in the community following a prison term 
while under the control, supervision, or care of a correctional 
agency. Violations of the conditions of supervision during this 
period may result in a new sentence to confinement or a return to 
confinement for a technical violation. This population includes 
parolees released through discretionary (i.e., parole board 
decision) or mandatory (i.e., provisions of a statute) supervised 
release from prison, those released through other types of post-
custody conditional supervision, and those sentenced to a term of 
supervised release.

Prison population--estimated number of inmates incarcerated in a 
long-term confinement facility, run by a state or the federal 
government, that typically holds felons and offenders with 
sentences of more than 1 year, although sentence length may vary 
by jurisdiction. 
**Prison jurisdiction population--estimated number of prisoners 
under the jurisdiction or legal authority of state or federal 
correctional officials, regardless of where the prisoner is held. 
This population represents BJS’s official measure of the prison 
population and includes prisoners held in prisons, 
penitentiaries, correctional facilities, halfway houses, boot 
camps, farms, training or treatment centers, and hospitals. 
Counts also include prisoners who were temporarily absent (less 
than 30 days), in court, or on work release; housed in privately 
operated facilities, local jails, or other state or federal 
facilities; and serving concurrent sentences for more than one 
correctional authority. 
 
**Prison custody population--estimated number of prisoners held 
in the physical custody of state or federal prisons regardless of 
sentence length or the authority having jurisdiction. This 
population includes prisoners housed for other correctional 
facilities but excludes those in the custody of local jails, 
inmates held in other jurisdictions, inmates out to court, and 
those in transit from one jurisdiction of legal authority to the 
custody of a confinement facility outside that jurisdiction. 
(This estimate is presented in appendix table 5.)

Probation population--estimated number of persons who are on a 
court-ordered period of supervision in the community while under 
the control, supervision, or care of a correctional agency. The 
probation conditions form a contract with the court by which the 
person must abide in order to remain in the community, generally 
in lieu of incarceration. In some cases, probation can be a 
combined sentence of incarceration followed by a period of 
community supervision.

Often, probation entails monitoring or surveillance by a 
correctional agency. In some instances, probation may not involve 
any reporting requirements.

Territorial prison population--estimated number of prisoners in 
the custody of correctional facilities operated by departments of 
corrections in U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands) and U.S. commonwealths (Northern Mariana 
Islands and Puerto Rico). (This estimate is presented in appendix 
table 4.)

Methodology

Data sources
****************

The statistics presented in this report include data from various 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) data collections, each relying 
on the voluntary participation of federal, state, and local 
respondents. For more information about any of the following data 
collections, see the Data Collections webpage at www.bjs.gov.

Annual Surveys of Probation and Parole. The Annual Surveys of 
Probation and Parole (ASPP) began in 1980. The reference date for 
the surveys is December 31, and they collect data from probation 
and parole agencies in the United States that supervise adults. 
Both surveys cover the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and 
the federal system. 

In these data, adults are persons who are subject to the 
jurisdiction of an adult criminal court or correctional agency. 
Persons age 17 or younger who were prosecuted in criminal court 
as if they were adults are considered adults, but persons age 17 
or younger who were under the jurisdiction of a juvenile court or 
agency are excluded.

Annual Survey of Jails. The Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) has 
collected data from a nationally representative sample of local 
jails each year since 1982, except in 1983, 1988, 1993, 1999, and 
2005, when a complete census of U.S. local jails was conducted. 
Jails are confinement facilities, usually administered by a local 
law enforcement agency, that are intended to hold adults, but 
they may also hold youth age 17 or younger before or after they 
are adjudicated. The ASJ data used in this report include inmates 
age 17 or younger who were held either before or after they were 
adjudicated (about 4,200 persons in 2014).

To maintain the jail series in this report, all tables and 
figures that include national estimates of the local jail 
population as of the last weekday in June were provided through 
the ASJ, except in 1999 and 2005 when a jail census was completed 
(see Census of Jails). Because the ASJ is designed to produce 
only national estimates, tables and figures in this report that 
include jurisdiction-level counts of the incarcerated population 
and the total correctional population were based on jail data 
collected through two other BJS sources, specifically the Census 
of Jails and the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program. (See Census 
of Jails and Deaths in Custody Reporting Program.)

Census of Jails. The Census of Jails began in 1970 and was 
conducted in 1972, 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, 1999, 2005, and 2006. 
In 2013, BJS expanded the 2013 Deaths in Custody Reporting 
Program—Annual Summary on Inmates under Jail Jurisdiction to act 
as the 2013 Census of Jails. (See Deaths in Custody Reporting 
Program.) The census is designed to produce a complete 
enumeration of jail facilities in the United States. It is part 
of a series of data collection efforts, including the Census of 
Jail Inmates and the Census of Jail Facilities, aimed at studying 
the nation’s jails and their inmate populations. The reference 
date of the 2013 census was December 31, while the reference date 
for prior iterations was the last weekday in June within the 
reference year. 

BJS relied on local jail counts provided through the census in 
1999, 2005, and 2013 to generate jurisdiction-level estimates of 
the total incarcerated population and total correctional 
population that appear in appendix tables 2 and 3. Because they 
include the 2013 local jail estimates as of December 31, the 
national totals of the correctional and incarcerated populations 
reported in appendix tables 2 and 3 are not consistent with the 
national totals of the populations reported in the other tables 
and figures of this report, which include BJS’s official 
estimates of the total correctional and incarcerated populations.

Deaths in Custody Reporting Program. The Deaths in Custody 
Reporting Program (DCRP) is an annual collection that provides 
national, state, and incident-level data on persons who died 
while in the physical custody of the 50 state departments of 
corrections or the approximately 2,900 local adult jail 
jurisdictions nationwide. To reduce respondent burden for the 
2013 iteration, BJS combined the 2013 DCRP collection with the 
2013 Census of Jails. For more information, see Census of Jails 
and Census of Jails: Population Changes, 1999–2013, NCJ 248627, 
BJS web, December 2015.

The DCRP began in 2000 under the Death in Custody Reporting Act 
of 2000 (P.L. 106–297), and it is the only national statistical 
collection to obtain comprehensive information about deaths in 
adult correctional facilities. In addition to the death count, 
BJS requests that jails provide summary statistics about their 
population and admissions. All jails, including those with no 
deaths to report (which includes about 80% of jails in any given 
year), are asked to complete the annual summary survey form.

BJS relied on the local jail counts provided through the DCRP in 
2014 to generate jurisdiction-level estimates of the total 
incarcerated population and total correctional population that 
appear in figures 2, 3, and 4 and appendix tables 1 and 2. 
Because they include the 2014 local jail estimates as of December 
31, the national totals of the correctional and incarcerated 
populations reported in appendix tables 1 and 2 are not 
consistent with the national totals of the populations reported 
in the other tables and figures of this report, which include 
BJS’s official estimates of the total correctional and 
incarcerated populations.

National Prisoner Statistics program. The National Prisoner 
Statistics (NPS) program began in 1926 under a mandate from 
Congress and has been conducted annually. It collects data from 
the nation’s state departments of corrections and the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons (BOP).

The NPS distinguishes between inmates in custody and prisoners 
under the jurisdiction of correctional authorities. To have 
custody of a prisoner, a state or the BOP must hold that inmate 
in one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction over a prisoner, 
the state or BOP must have legal authority over that prisoner, 
regardless of where the prisoner is incarcerated or supervised. 
Some states were unable to provide counts that distinguish 
between custody and jurisdiction. See Jurisdiction notes in 
Prisoners in 2014 (NCJ 248955, BJS web, September 2015) to 
determine which states did not distinguish between custody and 
jurisdiction counts.

With the exception of appendix table 5, the NPS prisoner counts 
in all tables and figures of this report are consistent with the 
jurisdiction counts and findings reported in Prisoners in 2014. 
The jurisdiction counts represent BJS’s official measure of the 
prison population.

The NPS prisoner custody counts are presented in appendix table 5 
and include all inmates age 17 or younger who were serving time 
in a state or federal correctional facility after being sentenced 
in criminal court as if they were adults (about 1,000 persons in 
2014), and inmates in the six states in which prisons and jails 
form one integrated system, including inmates age 17 or younger 
who may have been held before or after adjudication.

Through the annual NPS collection, BJS has obtained yearend 
counts of prisoners in the custody of U.S. military authorities 
from the Department of Defense Corrections Council since 1999. In 
1994, the council, comprising representatives from each branch of 
military service, adopted a standardized report (DD Form 2720) 
that obtains data on persons held in U.S. military confinement 
facilities inside and outside of the continental United States. 
These data are presented in appendix table 4 of this report. See 
Prisoners in 2014 for more statistics and information. 

Since 1995, through the annual NPS collection, BJS has collected 
yearend counts of inmates from the departments of corrections in 
U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin 
Islands) and U.S. commonwealths (Northern Mariana Islands and 
Puerto Rico). These data are presented in appendix table 4 of 
this report and represent all inmates in the custody of prison 
facilities in U.S. territories or commonwealths. See Prisoners in 
2014 for more information, including nonresponse. 

Survey of Jails in Indian Country. The Annual Survey of Jails in 
Indian Country (SJIC) has been conducted annually since 1998 with 
the exception of 2005 and 2006. The SJIC collects detailed 
information on all adult and juvenile confinement facilities, 
detention centers, jails, and other facilities operated by tribal 
authorities or the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of 
Indian Affairs. The SJIC data in this report includes inmates age 
17 or younger who are in the custody of Indian country jails 
(about 200 persons in 2014). These data are presented in appendix 
table 4. See Jails in Indian Country, 2014 (NCJ 248974, BJS web, 
October 2015) for more information. 

*************************************
Counts adjusted for offenders with
multiple correctional statuses
*************************************

Offenders under correctional supervision may have multiple 
correctional statuses for several reasons. For example, probation 
and parole agencies may not always be notified immediately of new 
arrests, jail admissions, or prison admissions; absconders 
included in a probation or parole agency’s population in one 
jurisdiction may actually be incarcerated in another 
jurisdiction; persons may be admitted to jail or prison before 
formal revocation hearings and potential discharge by a probation 
or parole agency; and persons may be serving separate probation 
and parole sentences concurrently. In addition, state and federal 
prisons may hold inmates in county facilities or local jails to 
reduce crowding in their prisons. 

Through the ASPP, BJS began collecting data on the number of 
probationers and parolees with multiple correctional statuses in 
1998 and has since expanded on the information collected. Through 
the NPS, BJS began collecting data in 1999 on the number of 
prisoners under the jurisdiction of state or federal prisons who 
were held in county facilities or local jails. Table 6 includes 
adjustments that were made to the total correctional population, 
total community supervision population, and total incarcerated 
population estimates presented in this report to exclude 
offenders with multiple correctional statuses to avoid double 
counting offenders.

The estimates from the ASPP are based on data reported by the 
probation and parole agencies that were able to provide the 
information within the specific reporting year. Because some 
probation and parole agencies did not provide these data each 
year, the numbers may underestimate the total number of offenders 
who had multiple correctional statuses between 2000 and 2014. 

Due to these adjustments, the sum of correctional statuses in 
tables 1, 2, 4, and 5; figure 1; and appendix tables 1, 2, and 3 
will not equal the total correctional population. In addition, 
the sum of the probation and parole populations for 2008 through 
2014 will not yield the total community supervision population 
because the total was adjusted for parolees who were also on 
probation. Also, the sum of the prison and local jail populations 
for 2000 through 2014 will not equal the total incarcerated 
population because prisoners held in local jails were excluded 
from the total.

Decomposing the decline in the
correctional supervision rate
*********************************

To decompose the decline in the correctional supervision rate, 
the following formula was used:

?R = [P1 * (1/GP1)] – [P0 * (1/GP0)]

= [P1 * ((1/GP1) - (1/GP0))] + [(1/GP0) * (P1 – P0)]

= [(1/GP1) * (P1 – P0)] + [P0 * ((1/GP1) – (1/GP0))]

In this formula, ?R is the change in the correctional supervision 
rate, P1 is the total correctional population for the most recent 
year, P0 is the total correctional population for the earlier 
year, GP1 is the U.S. adult resident population for the most 
recent year, and GP0 is the U.S. adult resident population for 
the earlier year. The components [(1/GP0) * (P1 – P0)] and 
[(1/GP1) * (P1 – P0)] provide the change in the correctional 
supervision rate due to the change in the total correctional 
population. These two components were summed, and the average was 
used to estimate the amount of change in the correctional 
supervision rate attributed to the change in the total 
correctional population during that period.

The components [P1 * ((1/GP1) – (1/GP0))] and [P0 * ((1/GP1) – 
(1/GP0))] provide the change due to the U.S. adult resident 
population. These two components were summed, and the average was 
used to estimate the amount of change in the correctional 
supervision rate attributed to the change in the U.S. adult 
resident population during the period.

Nonresponse adjustments to estimate 
population counts
************************************

***********************************************
Probation, parole, jail, and prison populations
***********************************************
 
Probation, parole, jail, and prison population counts were 
adjusted to account for nonresponse across the data collections. 
The methods varied and depended on the type of collection, type 
of respondent, and availability of information. For more 
information on the nonresponse adjustments implemented to 
generate national and jurisdiction-level estimates of the 
probation, parole, and prison populations, see Prisoners in 2014 
(NCJ 248955, BJS web, September 2015) and Probation and Parole in 
the United States, 2014 (NCJ 249057, BJS web, November 2015). For 
more information on the nonresponse adjustments implemented to 
generate national counts of the jail population that are included 
in the tables and figures of this report that include only 
national estimates, see Jail Inmates at Midyear 2014 (NCJ 248629, 
BJS web, June 2015).

***********************************************
Jail population—jurisdiction-level estimates
***********************************************

The response rate to the 1999 Census of Jails was 99.8%. Six jail 
jurisdictions did not respond to the census. Data for critical 
items, including the population count on the last weekday in 
June, were imputed based on previous survey and census reports. 
For more information, see Census of Jails, 1999 (NCJ 186633, BJS 
web, August 2001). Considering that the response rate to the 2005 
Census of Jail Inmates was 100%, no nonresponse adjustments were 
implemented. For more information, see Prison and Jail Inmates at 
Midyear 2005 (NCJ 213133, BJS web, May 2006).

Nonresponse in the 2013 Census of Jails and 2014 DCRP was 
minimal. The unit response rate to the 2013 Census of Jails was 
92.4% and the 2014 DCRP was 95.8% at the time of this report. The 
item response rate for the December 31 confined jail population 
total was 99.3% in the 2013 Census of Jails and 99.0% in the 2014 
DCRP. 

For jails that did not participate in the 2013 Census of Jails or 
2014 DCRP or were not able to provide the yearend confined 
population count, a sequential hot-deck imputation procedure was 
used to impute values. This procedure used respondent (donor) 
data as a substitute for missing values. The donor for each 
nonrespondent was randomly selected from within a set of similar 
jails, which was sorted by the previous-year population value. 
The resulting imputed values are generally similar to previous-
year reported values, but are not identical due to differences 
between each donor and nonrespondent pair and the year-to-year 
fluctuation in donor population values.

Because the 2013 Census of Jails and 2014 DCRP data collections 
used a census design (no sampling), each jail was initially self-
representing and had a design weight of 1. To reduce nonresponse 
bias, responding jails had their weight adjusted via post-
stratification to allow their responses to represent jails that 
did not respond. The description of the weighting used in the 
2014 DCRP is described next. The method used for the 2013 Census 
of Jails was similar. For more information, see Census of Jails: 
Population Changes, 1999–2013 (NCJ 248627, BJS web, November 
2015). 

Control totals for the 2014 confined jail population from the 
DCRP were estimated at the state level as follows:

* The year-to-year change in confined jail population among 
respondents to both the 2013 and 2014 DCRP was computed within 
the state.

* Plausible values for the 2013 confined population were imputed 
for jails that did not report to the DCRP in 2013 using a hot-
deck procedure that randomly selected a donor for each 
nonrespondent from within a set of jails that reported similar 
confined jail populations in the prior year. 

* Estimated 2014 values were calculated by multiplying the yearly 
change rate and the 2013 DCRP estimate of confined population for 
jails that did not respond to the 2014 DCRP.

* The sum of reported, item-imputed, and DCRP-estimated values 
for the 2014 confined jail population for each state 
served as the control totals for the post-stratification 
procedure. The post-stratification weight adjustment factor was 
identical for all jails within a state and was computed as the 
ratio of the control total for state i to the sum of the reported 
and item-imputed 2014 DCRP confined jail population values for 
state i:

The final analysis weight is the product of the design weight and 
the post-stratification adjustment factor. Because the design 
weight was 1 for all jails, the analysis weight is equal to the 
adjustment factor. 

***********************************************
Nonresponse adjustments to estimate males 
and females under correctional supervision
***********************************************

The number of males and the number of females on probation or 
parole in 2013 and 2014 were adjusted to account for nonresponse 
using a ratio adjustment method. For jurisdictions that did not 
provide data on sex for a single year, the sex distribution 
reported the prior or subsequent year was used. For jurisdictions 
that did not provide data on sex for a portion of their 
population, the sex distribution of the known portion of the 
population was used to impute for the unknown portion because it 
was assumed that the distributions were the same. For 
jurisdictions that were unable to provide any data on sex for 
more than 1 year, the state national average was used to impute 
the number of males and females supervised in those states. 
Adjusted jurisdiction totals were then aggregated to produce 
national estimates of the number of males and females on 
probation and parole. 

The counts of prisoners by sex in 2013 and 2014 were adjusted to 
account for nonresponse using either external sources or a ratio 
adjustment method. When possible, BJS used information available 
on state department of corrections’ websites to impute the number 
of males and females under the jurisdiction of that state’s 
prison system within the reference year. Otherwise, the sex 
distribution reported by the state in a recent, prior year was 
used to impute the number of males and females in the reference 
year. For more information, see Prisoners in 2014 (NCJ 248955, 
BJS web, September 2015). 

For jails that were unable to report the number of males and 
females confined at yearend 2013 or 2014, the same sequential 
hot-deck imputation procedure described in Jail population—  
jurisdiction-level estimates to impute for the confined jail 
population was also used to impute for the number of males and 
females confined in jail. Control totals for the 2014 confined 
jail population by sex were estimated at the state level as 
described in the section about weighting under the heading Jail 
population—jurisdiction-level estimates. A similar method was 
used to estimate 2013 control totals by sex. More information can 
be found in Census of Jails: Population Changes, 1999–2013 (NCJ 
248627, BJS web, November 2015).

To generate estimates of the total correctional population in 
2013 and 2014 by sex and jurisdiction, ratio estimation was used 
to account for male and female offenders with multiple 
correctional statuses in each jurisdiction. These adjustments 
were made by correctional status and were based on reported 
counts, by jurisdiction, of the number of offenders by sex and 
the number of offenders with multiple correctional statuses:

* To estimate the number of male and female prisoners held in 
local jails, the distribution of the prison population by sex 
within the reference year was applied to the number of prisoners 
in local jails by jurisdiction. The estimated number of male 
prisoners held in local jails was then subtracted from the total 
number of males under correctional supervision by jurisdiction. 
This same method was used to adjust the number of females under 
correctional supervision by jurisdiction
 
* The correctional population estimates in each jurisdiction were 
also adjusted to account for the number of males and females on 
probation who were held in prisons or local jails. The 
distribution of the local jail population by sex was applied to 
the number of probationers in local jails by jurisdiction within 
the reference year to estimate the number of males and females 
with both correctional statuses. In addition, the distribution of 
the prison population by sex was applied to the total number of 
probationers in prison within the reference year to estimate the 
number of males and females with both correctional statuses. The 
estimated number of male probationers in prisons and local jails 
was then subtracted from the number of males under correctional 
supervision within the reference year by jurisdiction, and this 
same method was used to adjust the number of females under 
correctional supervision by jurisdiction. This method was also 
employed to account for parolees held in prisons or local jails 
and the totals, by sex, were excluded from the number of males 
and females under correctional supervision in each jurisdiction.

* To estimate the number of males and females on parole who were 
also on probation in 2013 and 2014, the distribution of the 
parole population by sex within the reference year was applied to 
the number of parolees on probation in each jurisdiction. The 
estimated number of males with dual community supervision 
statuses was then subtracted from the number of males under 
correctional supervision by jurisdiction. This same method was 
used to adjust the number of females under correctional 
supervision. 

***********************************************
Comparability of jurisdiction-level 
estimates over time
***********************************************

All jurisdiction-level estimates included in this report are 
based on data reported within the reference year. Some 
jurisdictions update their population counts for different 
reasons after submitting their data to BJS. Updated population 
counts usually include data that were not entered into the 
information system before the survey was submitted or data that 
were not fully processed by yearend. 

Also, some jurisdictions have experienced reporting changes for 
one or more correctional population collections over time. These 
changes may result because of administrative changes, such as 
consolidating databases or implementing new information systems, 
resulting in data review and cleanup; reconciling offender 
records; reclassifying offenders, including those on probation to 
parole and offenders on dual community supervision statuses; and 
including certain subpopulations that were not previously 
reported.

For these reasons, comparisons between jurisdictions and 
comparisons between years for the same jurisdiction over time may 
not be valid. More detailed information about updates and 
reporting changes that impact the ability to make jurisdiction-
level comparisons over time can be found in the source reports 
for each of the four correctional populations, such as the 
Probation and Parole in the United States series or Prisoners 
series, within the particular reference year.
