On June 30, 2007, state and federal correctional authorities had jurisdiction
over 1,595,034 prisoners. Of these, 87.5% were under state jurisdiction and
12.5% were under federal jurisdiction (table 1).***State-level prison
population data and other detailed informationare available in Appendix
tables on the BJS Website at
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/pim07.pdf.>***More than 95% of
prisoners under state and federal jurisdiction were sentenced to more than 1
year. At midyear 2007, the imprisonment rate of persons sentenced to more
than 1 year was 509 per 100,000 U.S. residents. Jurisdiction refers to the
legal authority over a prisoner regardless of where a prisoner is held.
Imprisonment rate refers to the number of persons incarcerated in state and
federal prisons per 100,000 U.S. residents.

Growth in the prison population slowed slightly during the first six months
of 2007

Growth in the number of prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction slowed
slightly during the first six months of 2007, compared to the same period in
2006. Between January and June 2007, the prison population increased by
1.6% (or 24,919 prisoners), compared to a 2% increase during the first six
months of 2006 (figure 1).

The slowdown in the overall growth rate of the prison population during the
first half of 2007 was due to a decline in the growth rate of prisoners under
state jurisdiction. During the first six months of 2007, the number of
prisoners under state jurisdiction grew at a slower rate (1.4%) compared to
the same period in 2006 (2%). Prisoners under federal jurisdiction increased
more rapidly during the first six months in 2007 (3.1%) compared to the
same period in 2006 (1.8%).

Growth during the first half of the year generally outpaced growth during
the second half

More rapid growth during the first six months of the year compared to the
second six months was generally observed in the nation's prison population
(figure 2). With the exception of 2002, the majority of annual change in the
total prison population occurred during the first six months between 2000
and 2006. 

In 2000 and 2001, almost all of the annual growth in the nation's prison
population occurred during the first 6-month periods. Growth in the prison
population slowed in the second half of 2000 and decreased between July
and December 2001. 

During 2005 slightly more than half of the annual growth in the prison
population occurred during the first half of the year. A little less than half of
the growth in 2005 occurred during the second half of the year. 

Growth during the first half of 2007 slowed in states with the largest prison
populations 

Prison populations in the 10 states with the largest number of prisoners in
2000 increased during 2006 at more than three times (3.2%) the average
annual rate of growth (0.9%) from 2000 through 2005.***Prisoners in 2006,
BJS Bulletin, December 2007 (p. 3) NCJ 219416.*** During the first half
of 2007, growth in the number of prisoners in these states slowed to 0.7%, a
71% decline in the rate of growth from 2006. The 10 states included Texas,
California, Florida, New York, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Georgia,
Pennsylvania, and Louisiana. ***By December 31, 2006, North Carolina
replaced Louisiana as the state with the tenth largest prison population.***

Within these 10 states, the majority of the annual growth during 2006
occurred during the first six months of the year (figure 3). Prison
populations grew by 2.3% during the 6-month period ending June 30, 2006,
and increased by an additional 0.9% during the 6-month period ending
December 31, 2006.

Growth in the prison population in the remaining 40 states increased by
1.6% during the first six months of 2006 and by 2.2% during the first six
months of 2007.

All but two (Florida and Pennsylvania) of the10 largest states in 2000
reported slower prison growth during the first six months of 2007 than
during the first half of 2006. During the same period, Michigan and
Louisiana reported decreases of 1.8% and 0.1%, respectively (appendix 
table 1). 

Six-month growth rates in states ranged from increases of more than 8% to
decreases of 3%

During the first six months of 2007, the prison population increased in 41
states and declined in 8 states (table 2). Wyoming was the only state that did
not report a change. Twenty-six of the 41 states that reported an increase
exceeded the overall percentage increase (1.4%) in prisoners under
jurisdiction of state correctional authorities nationwide. Minnesota (8.6%)
reported the largest percentage increase during the first six months of 2007,
and Montana (down 2.9%) reported the largest percentage decrease. Florida
reported the largest absolute increase (2,109) in the size of its prison
population, and Michigan reported the largest absolute decrease (929).

Between 2000 and 2006, the prison populations decreased in New York,
New Jersey, Maryland, and Illinois; however, during the first six months of
2007, the prison population increased in these states. The largest growth
occurred in New Jersey. At midyear 2007, New Jersey reported an increase
of 3.7%, up from an annual average decrease of 1.4% from December 2000
to December 2006. 

For most state prison systems, long-term growth rates (the average annual
percent change between yearend 2000 and yearend 2006) differed from
short-term growth rates (first six months of 2007). In Massachusetts the
long-term growth rate for the prison population increased 0.5%, compared
to a 3.7% short-term rate. In Michigan the prison population had an average
annual increase of 1.3% between yearend 2000 and yearend 2006, compared
to a decline of 1.8% in the first six months of 2007. 

Growth in sentenced prisoners mirrored growth in all prisoners under
jurisdiction

The number of prisoners sentenced to more than 1 year increased 1.7%
between December 31, 2006 and June 30, 2007, or at about the same rate as
the total number of prisoners under jurisdiction (table 3). During the
6-month period ending June 30, 2007, the percentage change in the number
of sentenced male and female prisoners increased at about the same rates as
the overall percentage change in the number of prisoners under jurisdiction.
Female prisoners sentenced to more than 1 year (2.9%) increased at a
slightly faster rate than the overall female prison population (2.5%). 

On June 30, 2007, the imprisonment rate for prisoners sentenced to more
than 1 year was 509 per 100,000 U.S. residents, up from 501 at yearend
2006. Male prisoners sentenced to more than 1 year were imprisoned at a
rate of 957 per 100,000 male residents; female prisoners were imprisoned at
a rate of 69 per 100,000 female residents.

Prison admissions growth outpaced growth in releases

During 2006 (the most recent data available on prison admissions and
releases), the number of sentenced prisoners admitted to state or federal
prisons increased to 749,798, up 2.3% over the number admitted in 2005
(table 4). Sentenced prisoners released during 2006 reached 713,473, up
2.1% over the number released in 2005.***To avoid double counting, BJS
counts of sentenced admissions and releases exclude transfers, escapes, and
AWOLs.*** From yearend 2000 to 2006, the growth in prison admissions
(3.1%) exceeded releases (2.8%) (figure 4). The faster rate of growth in the
number of admissions was consistent with the general increase of sentenced
prisoners between 2000 and 2006. 

State admissions for parole violations grew more rapidly than new court
commitments 

During 2006, state prisons admitted 692,303 sentenced prisoners, an
increase of 2.3% since yearend 2005 (table 5). New court commitments
accounted for about 64% of sentenced admissions in 2006, a percentage that
has fluctuated between 60% and 64% since 2000. 

About a third (239,495) of all admissions to state prisons in 2006 were
offenders sentenced for violations of parole or conditions of supervised
release. This was a 3.1% increase over the 232,229 prisoners admitted for
parole violations in 2005. Since 2000, the percentage of state prison
admissions for parole violations fluctuated between a high of 36.3% in 2001
to a low of 33.1% in 2003 (figure 5). Parole violators were 34.6% of
admissions to prison at yearend 2006. 

California had both the largest absolute number and percentage increase of
admissions for parole violations. In 2006, 64.9% of all admissions in
California were for parole violations, down from 68.9% in 2000 (not shown
in table). Excluding California, parole violations represented slightly more
than a quarter of all state prison admissions in 2006.

Use of private facilities and local jails by federal correctional authorities
increased 12% 

At midyear 2007, there were 118,239 prisoners under jurisdiction in
privately operated facilities, up 5.4% (6,105 prisoners) from 112,134 at
midyear 2006 (table 6). During 2007, the number of prisoners under federal
jurisdiction in private facilities increased by 3,271, up 12.1% from June 30,
2006. 

Between midyear 2006 and midyear 2007, based on reporting from 49
states, the total number of prisoners under jurisdiction in private facilities
increased 3.3% (or by 2,834 prisoners). Over a third of this growth was
contributed by Arizona. Arizona reported an increase of 957 prisoners
which was offset by decreases in other states (appendix table 8). Illinois did
not report data in 2007 and did not have offenders in private facilities in
2006.   

On June 30, 2007, state and federal correctional authorities reported 79,688
prisoners under jurisdiction in local jails, an increase of 2.3% over the
77,903 reported at midyear 2006 (table 7). In both years, 5% of prisoners
under state or federal jurisdiction were housed in local jails. During 2007,
federal officials increased the number of prisoners housed in local jails by
243 prisoners, up 12.9% from June 30, 2006. State officials increased the
number housed in local jails by 1,542 prisoners, up 2.0% from midyear
2006. The majority of this growth can be attributed to the growth in
Kentucky (1,588) and Virginia (1,137) (not shown in table).

Inmates held in state or federal prison or in local jails increased to nearly 2.3
million

On June 30, 2007, an estimated 2.3 million inmates were held in custody in
state or federal prison facilities or in local jails (table 8). About two-thirds
(66%) of inmates in custody were held in prison, while about a third (34%)
were held in local jails. 

The custody count is defined as all inmates held in state or federal public
prison facilities, inmates held in privately operated facilities, and inmates
held in local jails, regardless of length of sentence and state holding
jurisdiction. It does not include inmates held in U.S. Territories, military
facilities, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities, jails in
Indian Country, and juvenile facilities. 

During the first six months of 2007, the custody population grew 1.8%
compared to an average annual growth rate of 2.6% from yearend 2000 to
yearend 2006. The incarceration rate for inmates in custody increased to 762
persons per 100,000 U.S. residents at midyear 2007, up from 751 at yearend
2006. Incarceration rate refers to the number of inmates held in state or
federal prisons or in local jails per 100,000 U.S. residents.
 
Black males ages 30 to 34 had the highest custody incarceration rate of any
race, age, or gender group

Of the 2.3 million inmates in custody, 2.1 million were men and 208,300
were women (table 9). Black males represented the largest percentage
(35.4%) of inmates held in custody, followed by white males (32.9%) and
Hispanic males (17.9%). 

Over a third (33.8%) of the total male custody population was ages 20 to 29
(appendix table 10). The largest percentage of black (35.5%) and Hispanic
(39.9%) males held in custody were ages 20 to 29. White males ages 35 to
44 accounted for the largest percentage (30.1%) of the white male custody
population. 

The largest percentage (35.9%) of the female custody population was ages
30 to 39. Over a third of white females (35.9%) were ages 30 and 39. The
largest percentage (36.8%) of Hispanic females in custody was ages 20 to
29.

The custody incarceration rate for black males was 4,618 per 100,000.
Hispanic males were incarcerated at a rate of 1,747 per 100,000. Compared
to the estimated numbers of black, white, and Hispanic males in the U.S.
resident population, black males (6 times) and Hispanic males (a little more
than 2 times) were more likely to be held in custody than white males. At
midyear 2007 the estimated incarceration rate of white males was 773 per
100,000.

Across all age categories, black males were incarcerated at higher rates than
white or Hispanic males. Black males ages 30 to 34 had the highest custody
incarceration rate of any race, age, or gender group at midyear 2007 (table
10). 

At midyear 2007, the incarceration rate of black women held in custody
(prison or jail) was 348 per 100,000 U.S. residents compared to 146
Hispanic women and 95 white women. With the exception of females ages
55 to 59, black women were held in custody at higher rates than Hispanic or
white women across all age categories.

Hispanic and white men accounted for more than half of the increase to the
custody population 

Between 2000 and 2007, the number of inmates in custody in prisons or
jails increased by 367,200. Male inmates (315,100) accounted for 86% of
the increase to the custody population (table 11). Female inmates (52,100)
made up the remaining 14%. 

From midyear 2000 through midyear 2007, Hispanic men (120,000)
represented the largest increase to the custody population. They accounted
for a third (32.7%) of the overall change in the number of inmates in prison
or jail. White men accounted for a quarter (25.0%), and white women for
about a tenth (9.0%) of the overall change during this period. Black men in
prison or jail increased by 23,100 and accounted for 6.3% of the overall
change to the population. Black women declined by 1,900 during this
period.   

Changes in the incarceration rates for men and women by race were
associated with changes to the overall composition of the custody
population at midyear 2007. Black men had an incarceration rate of 4,618
per 100,000 U.S. residents at midyear 2007, down from 4,777 at midyear
2000. For white men, the midyear 2007 incarceration rate was 773 per
100,000 U.S. residents, up from 683 at midyear 2000. The ratio of the
incarceration rates of black men to white men declined from 7 to 6 during
this period.    

Changes in the incarceration rates for women were more distinct. At
midyear 2000, black women were incarcerated at a rate 6 times that of white
women (or 380 per 100,000 U.S. residents versus 63 per 100,000 U.S.
residents). By June 30, 2007, the incarceration rate for black women
declined to 3.7 times that of white women (or 348 versus 95). An 8.4%
decline in the incarceration rate for black women and a 51% increase in the
rate for white women accounted for the overall decrease in the incarceration
rate of black women relative to white women at midyear 2007. 

Estimated number of non-U.S. citizens and juveniles in state custody
increased

An estimated 96,703 non-U.S. citizens were held in state or federal custody
on June 30, 2007, up an estimated 3.7% from the estimated 93,267 reported
to be held in custody on June 30, 2006 (table 12). Three states (Florida,
Illinois, and Oregon) not providing data on non-U.S. citizens for midyear
2007 reported holding 8,556 non-U.S. citizens in custody at midyear 2006.

The federal system and 40 states reported in both 2006 and 2007. In these
41 jurisdictions the number of non-U.S. citizens increased from 82,497 to
84,942 (not shown in table). California reported an increase of 2,598
non-U.S. citizens; Georgia reported an increase of 1,018. 

On June 30, 2007, state officials held an estimated 2,639 juveniles (persons
under age 18) in custody, a 10.4% increase from the estimated 2,390
juveniles held in custody on June 30, 2006 (table 13). Florida, Illinois, and
Oregon did not report data on the number of juveniles held in custody in
2007. In 2006, these three states collectively had custody of 330 juveniles. 

In the 44 states that reported in 2006 and 2007, the number of juveniles
increased by 199, from 2,034 to 2,233 (not shown in table). Alabama (38),
Michigan (37), and Mississippi (34) accounted for over half of this growth. 

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program has been collecting
statistics on prisoners at midyear and yearend under a Congressional
mandate since 1926. The Census Bureau serves as the data collection agent
for the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). BJS depends entirely upon the
voluntary participation of State Departments of Corrections and the Federal
Bureau of Prisons for NPS data.

The NPS distinguishes between prisoners in custody and prisoners under
jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a state or the federal system
must hold that prisoner in one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction over a
prisoner, a state or the federal system must have legal authority over the
prisoner. Some states are unable to provide both custody and jurisdiction
counts.

The NPS jurisdiction counts include inmates held within a jurisdiction's
facilities, including prisons, penitentiaries, correctional facilities, halfway
houses, boot camps, farms, training/treatment centers, and hospitals. They
include inmates who are:

*temporarily absent (less than 30 days), out to court, or on work release

*held in privately operated facilities, local jails, other state or federal
facilities

*serving a sentence for a responding jurisdiction and another jurisdiction at
the same time.

The NPS custody counts include all inmates held within a responding
jurisdiction's facilities, including inmates housed for other jurisdictions.
The custody counts exclude inmates held in local jails and in other
jurisdictions. With a few exceptions for several responding jurisdictions, the
NPS custody counts exclude inmates held in privately operated facilities.

The NPS counts also include all inmates in state-operated facilities in
Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which
have combined jail-prison systems. Since 2001 NPS prisoner counts have
excluded inmates held by the District of Columbia, which as of yearend
2001 operated only a jail system. Prisoners sentenced under the District of
Columbia criminal code are housed in federal facilities.

Illinois provided its 2007 total jurisdiction count. Combined with the 2006
reported counts for gender and sentenced individuals, ratio estimates were
calculated to estimate the 2007 jurisdiction counts for males, females, and
sentenced individuals.

Illinois, Florida, and Oregon did not provide data for non-U.S. citizens and
juveniles held in custody at midyear 2007. Estimated totals were calculated
using the custody, non-U.S. citizen, and juvenile information provided at
midyear 2006. 

For more information about the NPS data collection instruments, see
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/correct.htm#nps>.

Other inmate counts

With the exception of 2005, data on the number of inmates held in the
custody of local jails are from the BJS Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ). The
ASJ provides data on inmates in custody at midyear. For more information
about the ASJ, see Methodology in Jail Inmates at Midyear 2007 (NCJ
221945). 

The number of inmates held in the custody of local jails in 2005 are from
the 2005 Census of Jail Inmates. The 2005 Census of Jail Inmates was the
eighth in a series. Previous censuses of jails were conducted in 1970, 1972,
1978, 1983, 1988, 1993 and 1999. To reduce respondent burden and
improve data quality and timeliness, the census was split into two parts: the
Census of Jail Inmates, 2005, and the Census of Jail Facilities, 2006,
(conducted on March 31, 2006). As in previous censuses, the U.S. Census
Bureau was the collection agent for BJS. 

The 2005 Census of Jail Inmates included all locally administered
confinement facilities (under the authority of 2,853 local jurisdictions).
These facilities are intended for adults but sometimes hold juveniles. They
hold inmates beyond arraignment and are staffed by municipal or county
employees. The census also included 42 jails that were privately operated
under contract for local governments and 65 multi-jurisdiction jails that
were administered by two or more local governments. Included in the
census, but excluded from this report due to lack of comparability with
previous survey years, were 13 facilities maintained by the Federal Bureau
of Prisons and functioned as jails. 

The census excluded temporary holding facilities, such as drunk tanks and
police lockups, that do not hold persons after they are formally charged in
court (usually within 72 hours of arrest). Also, the census excluded
state-operated facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode
Island, and Vermont, which have combined jail-prison systems. 

Fourteen locally operated jails in Alaska were included. 

All jail jurisdictions responded to the census, resulting in a 100% response
rate. 

Estimating age-specific incarceration rates

Estimates are provided for the number of persons held in custody in state or
federal prisons or in local jails by gender (within genders by age group),
race (non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black), and Hispanic origin. The
detailed race and Hispanic origin categories exclude estimates of persons
identifying two or more races. For 2000 and 2007, estimates were produced
separately for inmates under state and federal jurisdiction and then
combined to obtain a total estimated population. State estimates were
prepared by combining information about the gender of prisoners from the
NPS with information on self-reported race and Hispanic origin from the
2004 Survey of Inmates of State Correctional Facilities.

To estimate federal prisoners, the distributions of FJSP counts of sentenced
federal inmates by gender, age, race, and Hispanic origin on September 30,
2006, were applied to the NPS counts of sentenced federal inmates by
gender at midyear 2007. Estimates of the U.S. resident population for July
1, 2007, by age, gender, race, and Hispanic origin, were generated by
applying the July 1, 2007 age distributions within gender, race, and
Hispanic origin groups to the June 30, 2007 population estimates by gender.
The population estimates were provided by the U.S. Census Bureau.
Age-specific rates of incarceration for each demographic group were
calculated by dividing the estimated number of sentenced prisoners within
each age group by the estimated number of U.S. residents in each age group,
multiplying the quotient by 100,000, and then rounding to the nearest whole
number. Totals by gender include all prisoners and U.S. residents regardless
of racial or Hispanic origin, while incarceration rates for detailed race and
Hispanic origin groups exclude persons identifying two or more races.

NPS jurisdiction notes

Alaska--Prisons and jails form one integrated system. All NPS data include
jail and prison populations housed in state and out of state. Jurisdictional
counts exclude inmates held in local jails that are operated by communities. 

Arizona--Jurisdiction counts are based on custody data and inmates in
contracted beds.

California--Non-citizens are defined as inmates held by the U.S.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Jurisdiction counts include felons
and unsentenced inmates who are temporarily housed in local jails or in a
hospital. 

Colorado--Jurisdiction counts include 166 inmates housed in local jails,
4,542 inmates in Colorado contract facilities, and 209 inmates in the
Youthful Offender System, which was established primarily for violent
juvenile offenders. Counts of inmates with a sentence of more than 1 year
include an undetermined number of inmates with a sentence of 1 year or
less. Non-citizen is defined as foreign-born. Jurisdiction counts are based on
custody counts. Counts for 2006 have been revised to reflect custody counts
instead of jurisdiction counts.
   
Connecticut--Prison and jails form one integrated system. All NPS data
include jail and prison populations.

Delaware--Prisons and jails form one integrated system. All NPS data
include jail and prison populations.

Federal--Custody counts include inmates housed in secure facilities where
the 
BOP had a direct contract with a private operator or a sub-contract with a
private provider at a local government facility. Custody includes 8,025
inmates held in non-secure privately operated community corrections
centers (Halfway Houses) and on home confinement. 

Georgia--Counts are based on custody data.

Hawaii--Prisons and jails form one integrated systems. All NPS data include
jail and prison populations. Non-citizen data based only on inmates who
reported their citizenship. Custody counts exclude inmates held in a state
run hospital.

Illinois--Data provided only for jurisdiction counts and sentenced prisoner
counts. See Methodology. 

Iowa--Jurisdiction counts are based on custody data. Jurisdiction counts for
Inmates with a sentence of more than 1 year include an undetermined
number of inmates with a sentence of less than 1 year and unsentenced
inmates. Iowa does not differentiate between these groups in its data system. 

Louisiana--Counts are as of December 27, 2006. Counts include 14,953
males and 1,244 females housed in local jails as a result of a partnership
with the Louisiana Sheriffs' Association and local authorities. Custody and
jurisdiction counts included evacuees from Hurricane Katrina and other
pretrial offenders from Orleans and Jefferson parish jails. Due to the effects
of Hurricane Katrina, Orleans and Jefferson parish prison capacities are
down. Local jail population is down from the 2004 numbers. 

Kansas--Jurisdiction counts of inmates with a sentence of more than 1 year
include an undetermined number of inmates with a sentence with a sentence
of more than 1 year. Citizen counts are estimated.
