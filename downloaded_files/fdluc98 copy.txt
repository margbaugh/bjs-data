State Court Processing Statistics 

Every 2 years, as part of its State 
Court Processing Statistics (SCPS)
program, the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics tracks a sample of felony
cases filed during the month of May in
40 of the Nation's 75 largest counties. 
The most recent SCPS study analyzed
cases filed during May 1998.

Trends in processing of felony 
defendants, 1990-98

Since 1990, the proportion of defendants
charged with a violent offense has
remained at about a fourth.  From 1992
to 1998, the proportion of drug
defendants increased from 30% to 37%. 
During this period, the percentage of
defendants charged with a property
crime decreased from 35% to 29%.  The
proportion of defendants charged with a
public-order offense has remained at
just under 1 in 10.

In 1998, the percentage of defendants
age 40 or older was 19%, nearly twice
the 10% found in the 1990 study. 
During the same time, the percentage 
of defendants under age 25 decreased
from 41% to 34%.

The percentage of female defendants
has increased from 14% in 1990 to 18%
in 1998.  In 1998, non-Hispanic blacks
accounted for 45% of defendants, a
slightly smaller percentage than in prior
years.  The percentage of non-Hispanic
whites and Hispanics increased slightly,
but still comprised roughly a fourth each.

Since 1990, approximately 3 in 8 
defendants have had an active criminal
justice status at the time of arrest in
each of the SCPS studies.  In 1998, the
percentage of defendants with a felony
arrest record (60%) was the same as in
1996, but higher than in previous years
when it averaged about 55%.  The
proportion of defendants with a felony
conviction record, continuing a slightly
upward trend, was 42% in 1998 -- up
from 36% in 1990.

Since 1990, the percentage of felony
defendants released prior to case
disposition has been fairly consistent,
ranging from 62% to 65%, with 64%
released in 1998.  In 1998, for the 
first time, the proportion of releases
accounted for by surety bond was
greater than that accounted for by 
release on personal recognizance.

From 1990 to 1998, the proportion of
released defendants charged with
misconduct such as failure to appear 
in court or rearrest has remained at 
just under a third.  Failure-to-appear
rates have held steady at about a fourth.

After reaching a high of 61% in the 1994
study, the felony conviction rate fell to
55% in 1996, and 52% in 1998.  This rate 
was similar to that found in 1992, and 
still slightly higher than the 50% felony 
conviction rate in the 1990 study.  Sixty-
eight percent of defendants were convicted 
of a felony or a misdemeanor in 1998, a 
lower percentage than in 1994 (72%), but
higher than in 1990 (64%). 

For defendants convicted of a felony,
sentences in 1998 (71%) were slightly
more likely to involve incarceration than
in 1996 (69%) and 1994 (68%).  However, 
incarceration rates in the 1998 study 
were slightly lower than in 1990 (75%) 
or 1992 (74%).  

In 1998, a felony conviction was about
as likely to result in a jail sentence 
as a sentence to prison.  In 1990, a 
felony conviction was more likely to result 
in a sentence to prison (43%) than jail 
(32%). The use of probation as a sentence 
for felony convictions in 1998 occurred 
with about the same frequency as in 1996
and 1994, but more frequently than in
1990 or 1992. 

Felony defendants in large urban
counties, 1998

Arrest charges

An estimated 56,606 felony cases were
filed in the State courts of the Nation's
75 largest counties during May 1998. 
About 1 in 4 defendants  were charged
with a violent offense, usually assault
(12.2%) or robbery (6.1%).  About 1 in
50 defendants were charged with murder 
(0.7%) or rape (1.3%).  

Two-thirds of defendants were charged
with either a drug (37%) or property
(29%) offense.  Nearly half of drug
defendants, 18% of defendants overall,
were charged with drug trafficking.  A
majority of property defendants were
charged with larceny/theft (9.9% of all
defendants) or burglary (7.5%).  About 1
in 10 defendants were charged with a
public-order offense.  Often these charges 
were driving-related (3.6%) or weapons-
related (2.8%).

Demographic characteristics

Eighty-two percent of defendants were
male, including 90% or more of those
charged with rape (100%), a weapons
offense (96%), a driving-related offense
(91%), robbery (91%), or burglary (90%).  
Women accounted for about half of the 
defendants charged with fraud (52%), 
and about a third of those charged with 
forgery (36%), or larceny/theft (31%).

Non-Hispanic Blacks comprised a 
majority of the defendants charged 
with a weapons offense (55%), murder
(54%), or robbery (53%).  Non-Hispanic
Whites accounted for 40% of those
charged with a driving-related felony.

Half of defendants were under age 30. 
Eighteen percent were under age 21,
including 34% of those charged with
robbery and 29% of those charged with
murder.  Three percent of defendants
were under age 18, including 11% of
robbery defendants and 9% of murder
defendants.

Criminal history

At the time of arrest, more than a third 
of defendants had an active criminal
justice status such as probation (16%),
release pending disposition of a prior
case (14%), or parole (5%).  Murder
(45%), robbery (44%), and drug trafficking 
(43%) defendants were the most likely to 
have had a criminal justice status when 
arrested.  

Seventy-one percent of all defendants
had been arrested previously, with 43%
having at least five prior arrest charges. 
Sixty percent of defendants had a felony
arrest record.  Sixty-one percent of
defendants had at least one prior 
conviction, including 42% with one or
more felony convictions.
 
Pretrial release and detention

Thirty-six percent of all defendants were
detained until the court disposed of their
case, including 7% who were denied bail.  
Half or more of defendants charged with 
murder (87%), robbery (62%), rape (53%), 
burglary (50%), or motor vehicle theft 
(50%) were detained until case disposition.

Defendants with an active criminal
justice status (58%) were twice as likely
to be detained until case disposition as
those without such a status (29%). 
Defendants on parole (82%) were the
most likely to be detained. 

Defendants were most likely to be
released on commercial surety bond
(36% of all releases), followed by
release on personal recognizance
(30%).  The next most common types
of pretrial release were conditional
release (13%) and deposit bond (8%).
  
An estimated 31% of released defendants 
committed one or more types of pretrial 
misconduct while in a release status.  
Twenty-four percent failed to appear in 
court as scheduled.  Sixteen percent were 
rearrested for a new offense, including 
10% for a felony. 

Adjudication

About 3 in 10 defendants had their case
adjudicated within 1 month of arrest, 
and more than half (54%) within 3 months.  
At the end of the 1-year study period, 
90% of all cases had been adjudicated.

Sixty-eight percent of the cases
adjudicated within 1 year resulted in 
a conviction.  Fifty-two percent of all
defendants were convicted of a felony,
and 15% of a misdemeanor.  Felony
conviction rates were highest for
defendants originally charged with
murder (68%) or drug trafficking (66%). 
Assault defendants (34%) had the lowest 
felony conviction rate.

Nearly all (96%) convictions obtained
during the 1-year study period were the
result of a guilty plea.  Nearly 4 in 5
guilty pleas were to a felony.  Seventy-
seven percent of trials resulted in a 
guilty verdict, including 83% of bench 
trials and 72% of jury trials.  

Sentencing

About 3 in 5 convicted defendants were
sentenced within 1 day of adjudication. 
About two-thirds of all sentences were
either to prison (30%) or jail (38%). 
Two-thirds of all jail sentences included
a probation term.  Nearly all convicted
defendants who did not receive an
incarceration sentence were placed on
probation.  

Thirty-six percent of the defendants
convicted of a felony were sentenced to
prison, including all of those convicted 
of murder.  A majority of  robbery (65%)
and rape (60%) convictions also resulted
in prison sentences.

About three-fifths of those with multiple
prior felony convictions (59%) were
sentenced to prison following a felony
conviction in the current case, compared
to about a fifth of those with no prior
felony convictions (21%).  Excluding life
sentences, the mean prison sentence for
defendants convicted of a violent felony 
was about 9 years, and the median was 5 
years. For those convicted of a nonviolent 
offense, the mean was about 4 years and 
the median, 21/2 years.  Murder (38 years)
and rape (10 years) convictions carried
the longest median prison sentences. 
About 1 in 7 convicted murderers received 
a life sentence.

State Court Processing Statistics

Since 1988, the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics (BJS) has sponsored a
biennial data collection on the
processing of felony defendants in the
State courts of the Nation's 75 most
populous counties.  Previously known as
the National Pretrial Reporting Program, 
this data collection series was renamed
the State Court Processing Statistics
(SCPS) program in 1994 to better reflect
the wide range of data elements collected.  

The SCPS program collects data on the 
demographic characteristics, criminal 
history, pretrial processing, adjudication, 
and sentencing of felony defendants. The 
SCPS data do not include Federal defendants.  
The reader should refer to the annual BJS
Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics 
for information on the processing of 
Federal defendants.  

The 1998 SCPS collected data for 15,909 
felony cases filed during May 1998 in 40 
large counties.  These cases, which were 
tracked for up to 1 year, were part of a 
2-stage sample that was representative of 
the estimated 56,606 felony cases filed 
in the Nation's 75 most populous counties 
during that month.  A small number of 
cases (31 unweighted, 111 weighted) were 
omitted from the analysis because they
could not be classified into one of the
four major crime categories (violent,
property, drug, public-order). 

In 1998, the 75 largest counties accounted 
for 37% of the U.S. population.  According 
to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports program 
for 1998, these jurisdictions accounted for
50% of all reported serious violent
crimes in the United States, including
65% of all robberies.  They accounted
for 45% of all reported serious property
crimes.  

According to the BJS National Judicial
Reporting Program, 40% of all felony
convictions in 1998 occurred in the 75
largest counties.  For national estimates
pertaining to felony convictions, see the
BJS report Felony Sentences in State
Courts, 1998.

Arrest charges

During May 1998, about a fourth of the
felony defendants in the 75 largest
counties were charged with a violent
offense (24.0%).  About half of those
charged with a violent felony, 12.2% 
of defendants overall, faced assault
charges, and about a fourth, 6.1% of
defendants overall, were charged with
robbery.  Murder defendants comprised
3.0% of the defendants charged with a
violent felony, and 0.7% of all felony
defendants.  Rape defendants accounted 
for 5.0% of the defendants charged with 
a violent felony, and 1.3% of all 
felony defendants (See Methodology for 
the specific crimes included in each 
offense category.)

For about 3 in 8 defendants, the most
serious arrest charge was a drug
offense (37.1%).  Nearly half (48%) of
drug defendants were charged with drug
trafficking.  Overall, defendants were
more likely to be charged with drug 
trafficking (17.7%) or other drug
offenses (19.4%) than any other type of
offense.

About 3 in 10 felony defendants were
charged with a property offense 
(29.3%).  About a third of property
defendants, 9.9% of defendants overall,
were charged with larceny/theft
offenses, and about a fourth, 7.5%
overall, were charged with burglary.  

Defendants charged with a public-order
offense comprised about a tenth (9.6%)
of all defendants.  Two-thirds of
public-order defendants faced a
weapons (2.8%) or driving-related
(3.6%) charge.

The percentage of felony defendants in
the 75 largest counties facing a
drug-related charge (37.1%) was about
the same as in 1996 (36.8%), but
significantly higher than the low of 30%
in 1992.  The percentage of property
defendants in 1998 (29.3%) continued 
a trend of small decreases that have
occurred since a high of 34.9% in 1992. 
The 1998 percentage of defendants
(24%) charged with a violent offense
was about the same as in 1996 (24.7%)
and slightly lower than the maximum of
26.5% in 1992.   

More than half of all felony defendants
(56%) faced at least one additional
charge and 37% were charged with at
least one additional felony.  Defendants
whose most serious charge was rape
(73%) were the most likely to have been
charged with one or more additional
offenses.  More than three-fifths of
defendants whose most serious arrest
charge was robbery (65%), forgery
(65%), drug trafficking (64%), burglary
(63%), or fraud (63%) were also charged
with one or more additional offenses. 

Two-thirds of rape defendants faced at
least 1 additional felony charge.  About
half of defendants charged with fraud
(55%), robbery (54%), murder (53%),
forgery (50%), drug trafficking (49%), 
or burglary (47%) also faced 1 or more
additional felony charges.  

Two fifths of assault defendants and
about a third of those charged with a
weapons-related offense (35%) or motor
vehicle theft (31%) faced multiple felony
charges.      

Demographic characteristics

Overall, 82% of felony defendants in the
75 largest counties were male.  Men
comprised the largest percentages among 
defendants charged with rape (100%), 
weapons offenses (96%), driving-related 
offenses (91%), robbery (91%), or burglary 
(90%).  Women accounted for 18% of 
defendants, including about half of those 
charged with fraud (52%), and about a 
third of those charged with forgery (36%) 
or larceny/theft (31%).

Without consideration of Hispanic origin,
which was reported poorly in some
jurisdictions (see Methodology),  57% of
defendants were black, 41% were white,
and 2% other races.  Blacks comprised
the largest percentages among defendants 
charged with weapons offenses (73%), robbery 
(70%), murder (68%), and drug trafficking 
(65%).  Whites accounted for a majority 
of the defendants facing driving-related
charges (58%).   

About a fourth of defendants were Hispanic 
(26%), including about a third of those 
charged with drug trafficking (32%).  Non-
Hispanic whites comprised about a fourth 
of defendants (27%), including two-fifths 
of those charged with a driving-related 
offense.  Non-Hispanic blacks comprised 45% 
of defendants, including a majority of 
those charged with a weapons offense (55%), 
murder (54%), or robbery (53%). 
 
The average age of defendants at the time 
of arrest was 31 years.  By specific offense, 
the average age ranged from 26 years for 
robbery defendants to 34 for those charged 
with a driving-related offense.  

Just over half of defendants charged with 
a violent offense (55%) were under age 30, 
as were about half of property (52%), drug 
(48%), and public-order (47%) defendants.  
About a tenth of robbery (11%) and murder 
(9%) defendants were under age 18.

An estimated 19% of defendants were 40 
or older, including about a fourth of
those charged with a driving-related
offenses (26%), rape (25%), fraud (25%), 
or a non-trafficking drug offense
(24%).

About half of robbery (53%), weapons
(49%), and murder (47%) defendants
were under age 25, compared to about a
third of defendants overall (34%). 
Defendants charged with rape (25%),
fraud (23%) or a driving-related offense
(17%) were the least likely to be under
age 25.

Defendants charged with robbery (34%),
murder (30%), motor vehicle theft (28%),
or a weapons offense (28%) were more
likely to be under age 21 than other
defendants.  Defendants charged with a
driving-related offense (6%) or fraud
(9%) were the least likely to be this
young.  

Males formed a higher percentage of
defendants under age 18 (90%) than of 
other age groups.  The largest percentage 
of female defendants was in the 30 to 
39 age group (22%).  Sixty-six percent 
of the defendants under age 18 were 
black, compared to 61% or less in other 
age groups.  

Black males comprised the largest
proportion of defendants in each age
group.  This effect was most pronounced 
in the under-age-18 category in which 
black males (62%) accounted for more 
than twice the percentage of white males 
(28%).  It was least pronounced in the 
age 35 to 39 category, where black males 
(41%) accounted for a proportion of 
defendants much closer to that accounted 
for by white males (36%). 

Black females comprised a slightly higher 
percentage than white females in most of 
the age categories, but for no more than 
13% of the defendants in any single age
category.

Criminal history

Criminal justice status at time 
of arrest

Thirty-seven percent of felony defendants 
had an active criminal justice status at 
the time of their arrest on the current 
felony charge.  Among defendants charged 
with a violent offense, about a third had 
an active criminal justice status, ranging 
from more than two-fifths of murder (45%) 
and robbery (44%) defendants to a fourth 
of rape defendants (25%).  

Thirty-six percent of property defendants 
had a criminal justice status, including 
about two-fifths of defendants charged with 
motor vehicle theft (41%) or burglary (39%).  
Among property defendants, those charged 
with fraud (26%) were the least likely to 
have had an active criminal justice status 
at the time of arrest.

Among drug defendants, 40% had a criminal
justice status overall. Those charged with
drug trafficking (43%) were more likely to
have a criminal justice status than those
charged with other drug offenses (36%). 

Forty-two percent of public-order defendants
had an active criminal justice status at the
time of the current arrest.  This included 
40% of those charged with a weapons offense,
33% of those charged with a driving-related
offense, and 53% of those charged with other
public-order offenses.

Some defendants with a criminal justice 
status had more than one type of status.  
When just the most serious criminal justice 
status is considered, 16% of defendants were 
on probation, 14% had been released pending
disposition of a previous case, and 5% were
on parole at the time of the current arrest. 
Allowing for defendants with multiple types 
of criminal justice, 17% had been released 
on a prior case, 16% were on probation, and 
5% were on parole. 

The percent of defendants on parole at the
time of their current felony arrest ranged 
from 7% of those charged with a weapons of-
fense to 1% of those with charged with fraud.  
Other offenses with at least 5% of the 
defendants on parole at the time of arrest 
included rape (6%), robbery (6%), burglary 
(6%), motor vehicle theft (6%), larceny/theft 
(5%), and drug trafficking (5%).  

The highest percentages of defendants on
probation were among those charged with
murder (21%), motor vehicle theft (20%), 
or a weapons offense (18%).  Defendants 
charged with rape (10%), forgery (11%), 
assault (12%), or fraud (13%) were less 
likely to have been on probation at the 
time of arrest.  

Defendants charged with robbery (20%), drug
trafficking (20%), or murder (18%) were the
most likely to have been on release pending
disposition of a prior case when they were
arrested on the current felony charge. These
defendants were about twice as likely as
those charged with fraud (9%) or rape (8%) 
to have had such a status at the time of the
current arrest.
 
Prior arrests

Seventy-one percent of all defendants had at
least one prior felony or misdemeanor arrest. 
Defendants whose most serious current arrest
charge was for a public-order (79%) or drug
(75%) offense were more likely to have been
previously arrested than those charged with 
a property (68%) or violent (67%) offense.  

Among defendants charged with a violent
offense, murder (81%) and robbery (73%)
defendants were more likely to have an 
arrest record those charged with assault 
(66%) or rape (61%). 

Among property defendants, those charged
with motor vehicle theft (78%) or burglary
(77%) were the most likely to have been
arrested previously, followed by those
charged with larceny/theft (66%) or forgery
(65%).  Defendants charged with fraud (53%)
were the least likely among property
defendants to have one or more prior 
arrests. 

Among public-order defendants, defendants
charged with a driving-related felony (83%)
were more likely to have an arrest record 
than those facing weapon charges (72%).

Among defendants with an arrest record,
about 7 in 8 had more than one prior arrest
charge, and a majority had at least five. 
Overall, 62% of defendants had two or more
prior arrest charges, and 43% had five or
more.  Defendants charged with a driving-
related offense (56%) or burglary (51%) 
were the most likely to have 5 or more
prior arrest charges, and those charged 
with fraud (22%) the least likely.
  
Twenty-five percent of all defendants had 
10 or more prior arrest charges.  This 
included 33% of defendants charged with a
driving-related offense, 31% of burglary
defendants, 29% of defendants charged with
drug trafficking, 28% of murder defendants,
and 27% of robbery defendants.
 
Two-thirds of defendants under age 18 had
no previous arrests.  This proportion 
dropped to just under half among defendants 
age 18 to 20, just under a third among those 
in the 21-to-24 age group, a fourth in the 
25-to-29 age group, and about a fifth among 
those age 30 to 49.  About a third of those 
age 50 or older had no arrest record.  

A fifth of the defendants age 18 to 20 had 
five or more prior arrests.  This proportion 
rose to more than a third of defendants in 
the 21-to-24 age range, just under half in 
the 25-to-29 age range, and slightly more 
than half in the 30-to-49 age range.  In the 
latter age range, defendants were more than 
twice as likely to have five or more prior 
arrests as no prior arrests.

Among defendants with an arrest record,
about 6 in 7 had been arrested at least 
once for a felony.  Overall, three-fifths 
of defendants had a felony arrest record.  
Nearly half of all defendants had multiple 
prior felony arrest charges, including 25% 
with five or more.

More than half of the defendants facing a
current charge for a violent felony had 
been previously arrested for a felony, 
including 67% of murder defendants and 63% 
of robbery defendants.  Thirty percent of 
robbery defendants had 5 or more prior 
felony arrest charges, including 12% with 
10 or more.  

Fifty-seven percent of property defendants
had 1 or more prior felony arrests.  About
two-thirds of those currently charged with
motor vehicle theft (67%) or burglary (66%)
had a prior felony arrest record, and about 
a third of these defendants had at least 
five prior felony arrest charges.  Fifteen 
percent of burglary defendants and 13% of 
motor vehicle theft defendants had 10 or 
more. 

Sixty-four percent of drug defendants had 
at least one prior felony arrest charge, 
and 27% had five or more.

Sixty-six percent of public-order defendants
had been previously arrested for a felony,
including 26% with five or more prior felony
charges.    

Prior convictions

Sixty-one percent of felony defendants in 
the 75 largest counties were known to have 
at least one prior conviction for a 
misdemeanor or a felony.  About three-fourths 
of those with a conviction record, accounting 
for 46% of defendants overall, had more than 
one prior conviction.  Twenty-three percent 
of all defendants had five or more prior 
convictions.  Among defendants charged with 
a violent offense, 57% had at least one 
prior conviction. Murder (70%), and robbery 
(63%) defendants were the most likely to 
have a conviction record, and rape defendants 
(51%) the least likely.

About half of robbery and murder defendants
had more than one prior conviction, and about
a fourth had 5 or more. 

Fifty-seven percent of property defendants 
had been convicted previously, including 67%
of burglary defendants.  Fifty-four percent 
of burglary defendants had multiple prior
convictions, including 29% with five or more.  

Nearly two-thirds of drug defendants had at
least one prior conviction (64%). About half
(49%) had two or more, and about a fourth
(24%) had at least five.  These percentages
did not vary significantly by type of drug
offense.

Among public-order defendants, 70% had a
conviction record, and 27% had five or more. 
Three-fourths of the  defendants facing
driving-related charges had at least one 
prior conviction of some type, and three-
fifths had multiple prior convictions.
 
About two-thirds of the defendants with a
conviction record, 42% of defendants 
overall, had at least one prior conviction 
for a felony.  

Thirty-seven percent of defendants whose
current charge was for a violent felony 
had previously been convicted of a felony. 
Among these defendants, the percentage with 
a prior felony conviction ranged from 54% 
among those charged with murder to 34% of 
those charged with assault.  

Forty percent of property defendants had a
felony conviction record, including nearly 
half of those charged with motor vehicle 
theft (48%) or burglary (47%).  Defendants
charged with fraud (28%) were the least 
likely to have a prior felony conviction.

Forty-four percent of the defendants whose
most serious current arrest charge was for 
a drug offense had been previously convicted 
of a felony, There was no significant 
variation by type of drug offense. 

A majority of the defendants with a felony
conviction record, 25% of defendants overall,
had multiple prior felony convictions.  Six
percent of all defendants had five or more
prior felony convictions. 

By specific offense, defendants charged with
burglary (33%) or motor vehicle theft (30%)
were the most likely to have multiple prior
felony convictions.  About 1 in 10 burglary
defendants had five or more such convictions. 
Defendants charged with fraud (13%) were
the least likely to have more than one prior
conviction for a felony.    

Seventy-seven percent of defendants under
age 18 at the time of the current arrest 
had no prior adult convictions.  Seventeen 
percent of these defendants had been 
previously convicted of at least one felony.  
Five percent had at least one prior convic-
tion for a misdemeanor, but none for a 
felony.  In the 18-to-20 age range, 62% of 
defendants had no prior convictions, while 
23% had at least one prior felony conviction.

A majority of the defendants age 21 or older
had a conviction record, and defendants ages
25 to 49 were more likely to have a felony
conviction record than no prior convictions 
at all.  About half of defendants age 30 to 
49 had a felony conviction record.

For nearly a third of the defendants with a
prior felony conviction, 12%  of defendants
overall, their criminal history included at 
least one conviction for a violent felony.  
Fifteen percent of the defendants currently 
charged with a violent offense had a prior 
conviction for a violent felony.  

By specific arrest charge, the percentage of
defendants previously convicted of a violent
felony was highest among those charged with
robbery (19%), a weapons offense (18%),
rape (17%),  burglary (16%), assault (15%) 
or murder (14%) (figure 9).  Defendants 
charged with fraud (3%) or forgery (7%) 
were the least likely to have a prior 
conviction for a violent felony.

The most serious prior conviction was a
nonviolent felony for 40% of murder
defendants.  This was also the case for 
about a third of defendants charged with 
motor vehicle theft (36%), drug trafficking 
(35%), a driving-related offense (34%), 
burglary (31%), or a weapons offense (31%).

Defendants charged with a driving-related
offense (28%) were more likely than other
defendants to have a conviction record that
consisted only of misdemeanors.

Pretrial release and detention

Rates of release and detention

An estimated 64% of felony defendants
in the 75 largest counties were released
prior to the final disposition of their 
case. By general offense category, 
defendants charged with a violent offense 
(54%) were less likely to be released 
than those whose most serious arrest charge
was a public-order (69%), drug (68%), or
property (66%) offense.  

Within the violent offense category,
release rates varied greatly.  Just 13%
of murder defendants were released
compared to 62% of those charged with
assault.  Forty-seven percent of rape
defendants and 38% of robbery defendants 
were released before the court disposed 
of their case.
 
Among defendants charged with a property 
offense, half of those charged with 
burglary or motor vehicle theft were
released prior to case disposition. 
Higher proportions of those charged with
fraud (84%), forgery (78%), or larceny/
theft (73%) were released.  

Among drug defendants, those charged
with drug trafficking (63%) were less
likely to be released than those charged
with other drug offenses (72%).  Among
public-order defendants, those charged
with a driving-related offense (78%)
were the most likely to be released.

Among the 37% of defendants who were
detained in jail until case disposition,
about 4 in 5 had a bail amount set but
did not post the money required to
secure release.  Detained murder
defendants were the exception to this
rule;  a majority of them, 47% of murder
defendants overall, were ordered held
without bail.  Across all offense types,
7% of felony defendants in the 75
largest counties were denied bail. 

A majority of the defendants released
prior to case disposition, 34% of
defendants overall, were released under
financial conditions that required the
posting of bail (see Methodology for
definitions related to pretrial release). 
The most common type of financial
release was surety bond (24% of all
defendants and 36% of released defendants), 
which involves the services of a commercial 
bail bond agent.  

Other types of financial release were 
deposit bond (5% of all defendants and
8% of released defendants), full cash
bond (3% and 5%), and property bond
(2% and 3%).  All of these types of
bonds are posted directly with the court
without the use of a bail bond agent.

Just under half of released defendants,
30% of defendants overall, were released 
under nonfinancial conditions not 
requiring the posting of bail. 

Release on personal recognizance (18%
of all defendants and 30% of released
defendants), was the type of nonfinancial 
release used most.  Other nonfinancial 
types of release included conditional 
release (8% of all defendants and 13% 
of released  defendants), and release on 
unsecured bond (4% and 6%).

A small number of defendants were released 
prior to case disposition as the result of 
an emergency release used to relieve jail 
crowding.  Such releases did not involve 
the use of any of the release types 
mentioned above.

Bail amounts

Overall, 64% of felony defendants had a
bail amount set by the court, and were
required to post all or part of that 
amount to secure release while their case 
was pending.  The remainder were granted
nonfinancial release (30%), ordered held
without bail (7%), or were part of an
emergency release (less than 0.5%). 
Just under half of those with a bail
amount had it set at $10,000 or more,
and a fourth had it set at $25,000 or
more.

Among defendants with a bail amount
set, those charged with a violent offense
(40%) were about twice as likely as
other defendants to have it set at
$25,000 or more.  About 9 in 10  murder
defendants (91%) with a bail amount
had it set at $25,000 or more, as did
about two-thirds of rape defendants
(67%) and about half of robbery
defendants (53%).  

Among property defendants with a bail
amount set, those charged with burglary
(25%) were the most likely to have bail
set at $25,000 or more.  Among drug
defendants, those charged with drug
trafficking (26%) were about twice as
likely to have bail set at $25,000 or 
more as other drug defendants (14%).  
Among public-order defendants, those 
charged with a weapons offense (24%) 
were more likely than those charged with 
a driving-related offense (14%) to have
bail set this high.

Overall, defendants who were detained
until case disposition had a median bail
amount 3 times that of defendants who
secured release ($15,000 versus $5,000).  
The mean bail amount for detained defend-
ants ($56,900) was about 5 times that of 
defendants who secured release ($11,300).  

Detained murder defendants had the
highest median ($250,000) and mean
($529,200) bail amounts.  Overall, the
median bail amount for murder defendants 
was $250,000 and the mean was $441,600.  

Overall, about half (52%) of defendants
who were required to post bail to secure
release did so.  About three-fourths of
defendants with a bail set at under
$5,000 (76%) posted the amount needed 
for release, as did about three-fifths of 
those with a bail amount of $5,000 to 
$9,999 (61%).  In contrast, just 1 in 8 
defendants with bail set at $50,000 or 
more (12%), and 1 in 4 defendants with a 
bail amount of $25,000 to  $49,999 (27%) 
met the financial conditions required for 
release.

Among defendants given financial release, 
the mean bail amount was higher for those 
released on surety ($13,300) or property 
($12,800) bond, than for those released 
on full cash ($9,200) or deposit ($8,600) 
bond. The median bail amount was $5,000 
for all types of financial release bonds 
except full cash ($2,500).  



Type of             Bail amount
release bond      Median     Mean
Surety            $5,000   $13,300
Deposit            5,000     8,600
Full cash          2,500     9,200
Property           5,000    12,800
 
Unsecured         $5,000    $7,700
 
Unlike those released on full cash bond,
defendants released on deposit bond
generally posted 10% of the full bail
amount with the court to secure release. 
However, they remained liable to the
court for the full bail amount if they
violated the terms of release.

Those released on surety bond paid a
similar fee to a bail bond agent, who
assumed liability to the court for the 
full bail amount if the defendant 
violated the terms of release.

Defendants released on an unsecured
bond had a median bail amount of
$5,000 and a mean bail amount of
$7,700.  These defendants did not 
have to post any of this amount, but 
like those on financial release, they 
were liable for the full bail amount 
if they violated the terms of release.

Time from arrest to release
                       
Among defendants released prior to case 
disposition, 54% were released within 1 
day of arrest, and 80% within 1 week.  
Nearly all releases during the 1-year 
study occurred within a month of arrest 
(94%).  
                       
By general offense category, defendants 
charged with a violent offense (49%) 
were the least likely to be released 
within 1 day of arrest.  Slightly more 
than half of those charged with a drug 
(53%), public-order (56%), or property 
(58%) offense were released this quickly. 
                       
By specific offense, murder defendants
typically waited the longest to be
released.  Just 7% of released murder
defendants were released within 1 day
of arrest, compared to 71% of those
charged with fraud and 63% of those
charged with charged with larceny/theft. 
After 1 month, just 32% of murder defend-
ant releases had occurred, compared to 
nearly all of the releases of other
defendants.

When differences among types of offense 
are held constant, defendants released 
under financial terms generally took 
longer to secure their release than
those who were released under nonfinancial 
conditions.  Among defendants who were 
released under financial conditions, the 
amount of time from arrest to pretrial 
release tended to increase as the bail 
amount did.

Criminal history and probability of
release

Court decisions about bail and pretrial
release are primarily based on the
judgment of whether a defendant will
appear in court as scheduled and
whether there is potential danger to 
the community from crimes that a
defendant may commit if released.   
Many States have established specific
criteria to be considered by the courts
when setting release conditions.  

The SCPS data illustrate how release
rates vary with some of these factors. 
For example, 71% of the defendants
without an active criminal justice status
when arrested for the current offense
were released prior to case disposition,
compared to 42% of those with such a
status.  Defendants on parole (18%) or
with an open bench warrant (20%) at the
time of arrest were the least likely to 
be released.  This compared with 43% of
those on probation and 55% of those
released pending disposition of a prior
case.

Seventy-nine percent of the defendants
with no prior arrests were released,
compared to 54% of those who had been 
previously arrested.  Among defendants 
with an arrest record, those who had 
never missed a court appearance (59%) 
had a higher probability of being 
released than those who had failed to 
appear at least once during a previous 
case (46%). 

About three-fourths of defendants
without a prior conviction (77%) were
released prior to disposition of the
current case, compared to half of those
with a conviction record.  Among
defendants with a conviction record,
release rates ranged from 62% for those
with a single prior conviction to 39% 
for those with five or more.

Less than half of the defendants with
one or more prior felony convictions
(44%) were released prior to disposition
of the current case, compared to about
three-fifths of those whose prior
convictions involved only misdemeanors
(62%). Those with a prior conviction 
for a violent felony (39%) had a lower
release rate than those whose most
serious prior conviction was for a
nonviolent felony (47%).

Conduct of released defendants

Among defendants who were released
prior to case disposition, 31% committed
some type of misconduct while in a
release status.  This may have been in
the form of a failure to appear in court,
an arrest for a new offense, or some other 
violation of release conditions that
resulted in the revocation of that release
by the court. 

By original offense category, the
proportion of defendants charged with
pretrial misconduct was higher for drug
defendants (38%) than for defendants
charged with a property (29%), public-
order (27%), or violent (24%) offense.  

By specific arrest offense, rates of
pretrial misconduct were highest among
defendants charged with drug trafficking
(40%), motor vehicle theft (39%), or
robbery (38%).  Defendants whose most
serious original arrest charge was fraud
(12%) had the lowest misconduct rate.

Failure to appear in court

About three-fourths of the defendants
who were released prior to case
disposition made all scheduled court
appearances (76%).  Bench warrants for
failing to appear in court were issued 
for the remaining 24% .  

Released drug defendants (30%) had
the highest failure-to-appear rate
followed by property defendants (24%).  
Lower percentages of defendants
charged with public-order (18%)  or
violent (14%) offenses failed to appear
in court as scheduled.  Within the violent
offense category, failure-to-appear rates
were highest for defendants charged
with robbery (21%).  

Nearly a fourth of the defendants who
failed to appear in court, 5% of all
defendants, were still fugitives at the 
end of the 1-year study period.  The
remainder were returned to the court
(either voluntarily or not) before the 
end of the study.

Defendants released after being charged 
with a drug offense (7%) were slightly 
more likely to be a fugitive after 1 year 
than defendants released after being 
charged with other offenses.  No released 
murder defendants were in a fugitive 
status at the end of the 1-year study 
period. 

Rearrest for a new offense

Overall, 16% of released defendants
were rearrested for a new offense
allegedly committed while they awaited
disposition of their original case. 
Sixty-two percent of these defendants,
10% of all released defendants, were
charged with a new felony.  Sixty-two
percent of the new felony arrests were
for the same category of offense as the
original charge, and 44% were for the
same specific type of offense.  

By original arrest charge, released drug
trafficking (25%) and robbery (24%)
defendants had the highest pretrial
rearrest rate.  Defendants originally
charged with fraud (3%) had the lowest. 
Defendants released after originally
being charged with robbery (15%), drug
trafficking (15%), or motor vehicle 
theft (14%) were the most likely to be
rearrested for a new felony while in a
release status.

Adjudication

Time from arrest to adjudication

For 54% of felony defendants in the 75
largest counties, adjudication of their
case occurred within 3 months of arrest,
and 75% of cases were adjudicated within 
6 months of arrest.  By the end of the 
1-year study period, 90% of all cases
had been adjudicated.

While the overall median time from arrest 
to adjudication was 79 days, it was about 
twice this long for rape defendants (163 
days), and was more than a year for murder 
defendants. Defendants charged with motor 
vehicle theft had the shortest median time 
from arrest to adjudication (49 days).

At the end of the 1-year study period, 61% 
of murder defendants were awaiting adjudi-
cation of their case, compared to 20% of 
rape defendants, and no more than 12% of 
the defendants in any other offense category.  

For each offense other than murder (for
which medians could not be calculated),
and rape (where the times were about
the same), the median time from arrest
to adjudication was shorter for detained
defendants than for those released
pending case disposition. 

The median time from arrest to adjudi-
cation was about 3 months longer for 
defendants released after being charged with 
motor vehicle theft, drug trafficking or a 
driving-related felony than for those detained.  
The difference was about 21/2 months among 
those charged with forgery or larceny/theft, 
and about 2 months among those charged 
with burglary, assault, or fraud.  
 
Excluding murder, the longest median
time from arrest to adjudication among
released defendants was for those
charged with rape (163 days), followed
by those charged with a driving-related
offense (131 days), drug trafficking (128
days), or forgery (126 days).  Detained
defendants charged with motor vehicle
theft (27 days) or fraud (28 days) had
the shortest adjudication time.

Adjudication outcome

Sixty-eight percent of the defendants
whose cases were adjudicated within 1
year of arrest were convicted.  A
majority of these convictions were for a
felony, with 52% of defendants eventually 
convicted of a felony.

About 6 in 10 defendants charged with 
a violent offense (59%) were eventually
convicted of a felony or a  misdemeanor,
compared to about 7 in 10 defendants
originally charged with a drug (72%),
property (69%), or public-order (69%)
offense.  By specific type of arrest
offense, the proportion of defendants
convicted ranged from about three-fourths 
of those charged with drug trafficking 
(77%), forgery (75%), a driving-related 
offense (73%), or burglary (72%) to just 
over half of those charged with assault 
(54%).  
 
The probability of being convicted of a
felony was highest for defendants whose
most serious arrest charge was murder
(68%) or drug trafficking (66%).  The
next highest felony conviction rates 
were for defendants charged with burglary
(58%), a weapons offense (57%), or a
driving-related offense (56%).  The
lowest felony conviction rate was for
assault defendants (34%).

In most cases where the defendant was
not convicted, it was because the
charges against the defendant were
dismissed.  An estimated 27% of all
cases ended in this way, with about
two-fifths of dismissals by the prosecutor
and three-fifths by the court.  Defendants 
charged with assault (41%) were the most 
likely to have their case dismissed, and 
those charged with fraud (18%) or drug 
trafficking (19%) the least likely.  

About 4% of cases had other outcomes
such as diversion or deferred adjudication.  
Defendants charged with fraud (12%) were 
the most likely to have their case handled 
in this manner.  

Seventy-eight percent of the defendants
who were detained until case disposition
were eventually convicted of some offense, 
compared to 63% of those released pending 
disposition. Approximately two-thirds of 
detained defendants (67%) were convicted 
of a felony, compared to under half of
released defendants (46%).

Adjudication outcome was related to
some extent to the number and type of
the original arrest charges filed. 
Seventy-two percent of defendants 
who were originally charged with more
than 1 felony were eventually convicted
of some offense, compared to 65% of
the defendants who had no additional
felony charges.

Sixty percent of defendants whose
original arrest charges included more
than one felony were eventually
convicted of a felony compared to 48%
of those with no additional felony
charges.  Among the defendants who
had no additional felony charges, those
who were charged with one or more
misdemeanors (36%), were less likely to
be convicted of a felony than those who
had no additional charges (53%).

Defendants with only one felony charge,
but one or more additional misdemeanor
charges, were about twice as likely as
other defendants to eventually be
convicted of a misdemeanor (29%). 
This almost always was the result of
their pleading guilty to a misdemeanor
charge instead of the original felony
charge.

Overall, about two-thirds of defendants
entered a guilty plea at some point, with
50% pleading guilty to a felony, and 15%
to a misdemeanor.

Two-thirds or more of defendants charged 
with drug trafficking (74%), forgery (72%), 
burglary (71%), a driving-related offense 
(70%), fraud (67%), or a weapons offense 
(66%) pleaded guilty to either a felony or 
a misdemeanor.  Murder defendants (42%) had 
the lowest overall plea rate, with all of 
these pleas to a felony.

Nearly two-thirds of defendants charged
with drug trafficking (64%) pleaded guilty
to a felony, as did a majority of those
charged with burglary (57%), a weapons
offense (55%), or a driving-related offense 
(53%).  Assault defendants (32%) were the 
least likely to plead guilty to a felony 
charge. 

An estimated 4% of the cases adjudicated 
within 1 year went to trial. These trials 
were divided evenly between bench trials, 
decided by a judge, and jury trials. An 
estimated 77% of all trials ended with a 
guilty verdict, and 23% with an acquittal.  
Bench trials (83%) were more likely to 
result in a conviction than jury trials 
(72%); however, 65% of jury trials resulted 
in a felony conviction compared to 57% of
bench trials.

Twenty-eight percent of defendants facing 
murder charges went to trial, compared to 
no more than 8% of defendants charged with 
other offenses. 

Regardless of adjudication method, a
majority of convicted defendants were
convicted of the same felony offense as
the original arrest charge.  Among
defendants arrested for murder and later
convicted, 74% were convicted of murder.  
The corresponding percentages for other 
violent offenses were as follows: robbery 
(62%), rape (54%), and assault (51%).

Among defendants originally charged with 
a property offense and later convicted, 
the percentages whose conviction offense 
corresponded with their most serious arrest 
charge were as follows:  larceny/theft 
(69%), motor vehicle theft (67%), burglary 
(64%), forgery (62%), and fraud (56%).

About three-fourths of defendants
convicted after being charged with a
weapon offense (78%), drug trafficking
(74%), or a driving-related offense (72%)
were convicted of that same offense.   

For most offenses a smaller percentage
of defendants were in each felony 
conviction offense category than were in
the original distribution by arrest charge. 
The biggest drop was in the violent
felony category, which accounted for
about 24% of all defendants by arrest
charge, but just 13% of them by conviction 
charge.  

Much of this change can be accounted
for by the fact that about 12% of all
defendants were originally facing felony
assault charges, but just 6% of all
convictions were for such an offense. 
Overall, 23% of convicted defendants
were convicted at the misdemeanor level, 
including 37% of those convicted after 
being originally charged with felony
assault.  

Given arrest, slightly more than half of
defendants whose most serious arrest
charge was for drug trafficking (57%), a
weapons offense (54%), or a driving-
related offense (53%) were eventually
convicted of that same offense.  This was 
true for about half of murder defendants, 
and slightly less than half of the defend-
ants originally charged with forgery (47%), 
burglary (46%), larceny/theft (45%), or 
motor vehicle theft (44%).  Just 28% of 
defendants originally facing felony 
assault charges were eventually convicted 
of such an offense.   

Case processing statistics

Among the approximately 50,000 cases
with a known adjudication outcome that
occurred within 1 year of arrest, about
32,500 were disposed by a guilty plea. 
About 3 in 10 pleas occurred within 1
month of arrest and 6 in 10 within 3
months of arrest.  

The next most common type of adjudication, 
dismissal of the charges against the 
defendant, occurred in about 13,600 cases.  
Nearly half (46%) of all dismissals occurred 
within the first month after arrest and 
70% within 3 months.  

Trials occurred in about 1,900 cases. 
About 1 in 12 trials were completed
within a month of arrest and about 1 in 
4 within 3 months of arrest.  

Guilty pleas accounted for 96% of the
34,000 convictions obtained within 1
year of arrest.  This included about
25,100 felony pleas and about 7,300
misdemeanor pleas.  Twenty-six percent
of the felony pleas occurred within 1
month of arrest, and 59% were obtained
within 3 months of arrest.  Thirty-six
percent of the misdemeanor pleas were
obtained with 1 month of arrest, and
66% within 3 months.  

Of the approximately 1,500 trial
convictions obtained within 1 year,
nearly all were for a felony, with about
300 trials resulting in a misdemeanor
conviction.  About a fourth of all trial
convictions occurred within 3 months of
arrest, and about two-thirds within 6
months of arrest.

Sentencing

Time from conviction to sentencing

About 3 in 5 convicted defendants were
sentenced within 1 day of adjudication. 
Defendants convicted of a misdemeanor
(80%) were more likely to be sentenced
this quickly than those convicted of a
felony (57%). 

Sentencing after a felony conviction was
most likely to occur within 1 day if the
conviction was for a property (61%) or
public-order (60%) offense.  Defendants
convicted of a violent offense (50%)
were the least likely to be sentenced this
quickly.  

Within the violent offense category, the
proportion of convicted defendants
sentenced within 1 day ranged from about 
a third of those convicted of murder to 
about half of those convicted of other 
violent felonies.  With the exception of 
drug traffickers (48%), a majority of the 
defendants in other offense categories 
were sentenced within a day of conviction. 

Seventy-five percent of defendants
convicted of a felony received their
sentence within 30 days, compared to 
85% of those convicted of a misdemeanor.  
About 9 in 10 defendants were sentenced 
within 60 days, including 92% of those 
convicted of a misdemeanor and 89% of 
those convicted of a felony.

Type and length of sentence

Sixty-eight percent of convicted defend-
ants were sentenced to incarceration in 
a State prison or local jail.  Seventy-
one percent of defendants convicted of a 
felony were sentenced to incarceration, 
compared to 54% of those convicted of a 
misdemeanor.   

About half of incarceration sentences
following a felony conviction, 36% of
felony sentences overall, were to State
prison.  Fifteen percent of prison
sentences included a probation term to
be served after release.  

All murder convictions resulted in a
prison sentence, as did a majority of
robbery (65%) and rape (60%) convictions.  
Although less than half of defendants 
convicted of burglary (48%), drug 
trafficking (42%), felony assault (40%), 
or a weapons offense (36%) were sentenced 
to prison, a prison term was still more 
likely than a sentence to jail, probation, 
or fine. 

Nearly all incarceration sentences for 
misdemeanor convictions, 52% of all
misdemeanor sentences, were to jail. 
Two-thirds of jail sentences included a
probation term to be served in addition
to the jail time.  This was much more
likely for defendants convicted of a
felony (74%) than those convicted of a
misdemeanor (42%).  

Among defendants who were convicted
but not sentenced to incarceration, 98%
of those convicted of a felony and 84%
of those convicted of a misdemeanor
received a probation term.  Probation
sentences may have included a fine,
restitution, community service,
treatment, or other conditions.

Overall, 30% of convicted defendants
received a sentence to probation 
without any incarceration.  This 
included 29% of those convicted of a 
felony and 39% of those convicted of 
a misdemeanor.

Defendants convicted of fraud (50%) 
were the most likely to be sentenced to
probation.  About two-fifths of defen-
dants convicted of forgery (42%), and 
about a third of those convicted of a
non-trafficking drug offense (35%),
larceny/theft (34%), or a weapons
offense (33%) received a probation 
term without incarceration. 

Two percent of defendants were fined
but were not sentenced to a term of
incarceration or probation.  These 
fines may have been in addition to 
other court-ordered conditions.

Among persons arrested and charged with a 
felony by the prosecutor, murder defend-
ants had the highest probability of
eventually being convicted and sentenced 
to prison (68%). The next highest 
probability of an eventual prison 
sentence was for defendants charged
with robbery (39%) or drug trafficking
(37%).  About a third of defendants
originally charged with rape (33%) 
or burglary (32%) were eventually 
convicted and sentenced to prison. 
Defendants originally charged with 
fraud (15%) were the least likely to 
eventually be sentenced to prison.  

Defendants originally charged with a
driving-related offense (31%), or motor
vehicle theft (30%) were the most likely
to be eventually convicted and receive a
jail sentence.  No murder defendants
were convicted and sentenced to jail.  

Half or more of defendants charged with
murder (68%), drug trafficking (61%),
robbery (57%), a driving-related offense
(56%), burglary (55%) motor vehicle
theft (53%), or rape (51%) were
eventually convicted and sentenced to
either prison or jail.  Fraud (33%)
defendants were the least likely to be
eventually convicted and sentenced to
some type of incarceration.

Among defendants convicted of a felony
and sentenced to prison, the mean
sentence was 58 months and the median 
was 36 months.  By general conviction 
offense category, defendants convicted 
of a violent felony received the longest 
prison sentences (a mean of 104 months 
and a median of 60 months), and those 
convicted of a public-order felony the 
shortest (a mean of 39 months and a 
median of 24 months).  

By specific conviction offense, murder-
ers received the longest prison terms,   
a mean of 430 months and a median of 456 
months.  Next were defendants convicted 
of rape with a mean prison sentence of 
188 months, and a median of 120 months.  

Median prison sentences for other felony
convictions included 72 months for robbery, 
45 months for assault, and 36 months for 
burglary, drug trafficking, weapons offenses, 
or forgery. Fourteen percent of all 
murder convictions resulted in a life 
sentence, compared to a maximum of 4% 
of the defendants convicted of any 
other offense.
 
In addition to those receiving life
sentences, 68% of the defendants
convicted of murder were sentenced to
more than 10 years in prison.  About 
1 in 3 rape convictions, 1 in 6 robbery
convictions, and 1 in 8 felony assault
convictions resulted in a prison term 
of more than 10 years.

For defendants convicted of a felony and
subsequently sentenced to jail, the mean 
jail term was 7 months and the median was 
6 months.  Misdemeanor convictions 
resulted in a mean jail term of 6 months 
and a median of 3 months.  Excluding 
murder (for which all sentences were to 
prison), and rape (for which few cases 
resulted in a jail sentence), defendants 
sentenced to jail for robbery received 
the longest average sentence (a mean of 
17 months and a median of 10 months).

About two-thirds of all jail sentences
were for a period of greater than 3
months.  About 3 in 5 jail sentences
following convictions for public-order
felonies were for more than 3 months
compared to about 3 in 4 sentences for
other types of felonies.  

About 2% of all jail sentences for a 
felony conviction were for a period
greater than 1 year, including 8% of 
those that followed a conviction for 
robbery. 

For defendants sentenced to probation
without incarceration for a felony, the
median sentence length was 36 months,
compared to 24 months for a misdemeanor.  
Two percent of defendants convicted of 
a felony were given a probation term of 
greater than 5 years, including 5% of 
those sentenced for a violent felony.

An estimated 24% of defendants sentenced 
to probation were also required to pay 
a fine.  Some probation sentences were 
also supplemented by one or more special 
court-ordered conditions.  For example, 
22% of the defendants who received a 
probation sentence were required to perform 
a specified number of hours of community
service work. 

Nineteen percent of offenders sentenced
to probation were required to pay
restitution, including 32% of those
convicted for a property-related felony. 
Ten percent of probation sentences
included a requirement that the
defendant enter a treatment program. 
Defendants convicted of a drug-related
felony (17%) were the most likely to
have this requirement. 

Prior record and felony sentencing

For defendants convicted of a felony on
their current charge, the probability of
receiving a sentence to incarceration
was highest if they had multiple prior
felony convictions (86%).  A large 
majority of defendants with just one 
prior felony conviction  (83%), or with 
only prior misdemeanor convictions (74%), 
were also sentenced to incarceration 
following a felony conviction in the 
current case. 

Just over half of those with no prior
convictions of any type (55%) received
an incarceration sentence for a felony
conviction.

Defendants with no prior convictions 
and whose current conviction was for a
public-order (45%) or property (44%)
offense were the least likely of all
defendants convicted of a felony to be
sentenced to incarceration.

A majority (59%) of the defendants with
more than one prior felony conviction
were sentenced to prison for a new
felony conviction.  This included 69% of
those whose current conviction was for a
violent offense.  

Forty-five percent of the defendants with
a single prior felony conviction were
sentenced to prison following a felony
conviction in the current case, including
64% of those convicted of a violent
felony.  

Overall, less than a fourth of defendants
without a prior felony conviction received
a prison sentence for a felony conviction
in the current case.  How- ever, 37% of
such defendants received a prison
sentence when the current conviction
was for a violent felony.  

Defendants with a prior conviction
record consisting solely of
misdemeanors who were convicted of a
nonviolent felony in the current case
were more likely than other defendants
to receive a jail sentence (53%). 

Defendants with no prior convictions of
any kind whose current conviction was
for a property (54%) or public-order
(53%) offense were the most likely to
receive a probation sentence.  

Defendants convicted of a violent felony
were much more likely to be sentenced
to prison than jail or probation if they 
had at least one prior felony conviction. 
Those without a prior felony conviction
were as likely to be sentenced to jail as
prison. 

Among defendants convicted of a nonviolent 
felony, prison was the most likely sentence 
for those with multiple prior felony 
convictions.  However, those with a single 
prior felony conviction were as likely to 
be sentenced to jail as prison.    

Jail was the most probable sentence for
a nonviolent felony among defendants
who had a prior conviction record that
consisted of only misdemeanors.  Probation 
was the most likely sentence if they had 
no conviction record at all.
 
Methodology

The SCPS sample was designed and selected 
by U.S. Census Bureau staff.  It is a 2-
stage stratified sample, with 40 of the 
75 most populous counties selected at 
stage one and a systematic sample of
State court felony filings (defendants)
within each county selected at stage
two. The 40 counties were divided into
4 first-stage strata based on court filing
information obtained through a telephone 
survey.  Twelve counties were included 
in the sample with certainty because of 
their large number of court filings. The 
remaining counties were allocated to the 
three noncertainty strata based on the 
variance of felony court dispositions. 

SCPS first-stage design
 
           Number of counties
Stratum    Sample   Universe   Weight
One          12        12       1.00
Two           9        12       1.33
Three*        9        18       2.00
Four         10        33       3.30
 
*Data collection problems caused Fulton County
(GA), which had been selected for stratum three
in the 1998 SCPS sample, to be dropped from
the study.  Because this occurred at a date too
late to allow for a substitution, the number of
counties in stratum three was reduced from nine
(as specified in the original design) to eight.
This changed the first-stage weight for stratum
three counties from 2.00 to 2.25.

The second-stage sampling (filings) was
designed to represent all defendants
who had felony cases filed with the court
during the month of May 1998.  The
participating jurisdictions provided data
for every felony case filed on selected
days during that month. Depending on
the first-stage stratum in which it had
been placed, each jurisdiction provided
data for 5, 10, or 20 randomly selected
business days' filings in May 1998. Data
from jurisdictions that were not required
to provide a full month of filings were
weighted to represent the full month. 

SCPS second-stage design
 
            Number of days
            of filings
Stratum     provided    Weight
One            5          4.0
Two           10          2.0
Three         10          2.0
Four          20          1.0

Data on 15,909 sample felony cases were 
collected from the 40 sampled jurisdictions.  
This sample represented 56,606 weighted 
cases filed during May 1998 in the 75 most 
populous counties. A small number of cases 
(31 unweighted, 111 weighted) were omitted
from the analysis because they could not 
be classified into one of the four major 
crime categories (violent, property, drug, 
public-order).  

This report is based on data collected from 
the following counties and independent 
cities: Alabama (Jefferson); Arizona 
(Maricopa, Pima); California (Alameda, Los 
Angeles, Orange, Sacramento, San Bernardino, 
San Francisco, Santa Clara, Ventura);
Florida (Broward, Miami-Dade, Hillsborough, 
Orange); Illinois (Cook, DuPage); Indiana 
(Marion); Kentucky (Jefferson); Maryland 
(Baltimore (city)), Montgomery); Michigan 
(Wayne); Missouri (Jackson, St. Louis); New 
York (Bronx, Erie, Kings, Monroe, New York,
Queens, Suffolk); Ohio (Hamilton);
Pennsylvania (Allegheny, Philadelphia);
Tennessee (Shelby); Texas (Dallas, Harris); 
Washington (King); and Wisconsin 
(Milwaukee).

Because the data came from a sample,
a sampling error (standard error) is
associated with each reported number. 
In general, if the difference between 
two numbers is greater than twice the
standard error for that difference, we 
can say that we are 95% confident of 
a real difference and that the apparent
difference is not simply the result of
using a sample rather than the entire
population.
 
Race and Hispanic (Latino) origin

Several jurisdictions did not provide
complete reporting for defendants'
Hispanic origin.  As a result, the 
overall reporting level for race combined 
with Hispanic origin was 73%, compared 
to 86% for race alone.  Because of this
underreporting, the categories of race
alone account for more defendants than
the categories that include both race and
Hispanic origin.  A large preponderance
of the defendants with a Hispanic origin
were white, although the category
includes all races. 

Offense categories
 
Felony offenses were classified into 16
categories for this report.  These were
further classified into the four major
crime categories of violent, property,
drug, and public-order.  The following
listings are a representative summary 
of the crimes in each category; however,
these lists are not meant to be
exhaustive.  All offenses, except for
murder, include attempts and conspiracies 
to commit.  Within the property offense 
category, the offense categories of motor 
vehicle theft, forgery, and fraud are new 
for 1998.

Terms related to pretrial release

Released defendant -- Includes any
defendant who was released from custody 
prior to the disposition of his or her 
case by the court.  Includes defendants 
who were detained for some period of 
time before being released and defendants 
who were returned to custody after being 
released because of a violation of the 
conditions of pretrial release.  The terms 
"on pretrial release" and "released pending 
disposition" are both used in this report 
to refer to all released defendants.

Detained defendant -- Includes any
defendant who remained in custody from
the time of arrest until the disposition of
his or her case by the court.  This report
also refers to detained defendants as
"not released."

Failure to appear -- Occurs when a court
issues a bench warrant for a defendant's
arrest because he or she has missed a
scheduled court appearance.  

Types of financial release

Surety bond -- A bail bond company signs 
a promissory note to the court for the 
full bail amount and charges the defendant 
a fee for the service (usually 10% of the 
full bail amount). If the defendant fails 
to appear, the bond company is liable to 
the court for the full bail amount.  
Frequently the bond company requires 
collateral from the defendant in addition 
to the fee.

Deposit bond -- The defendant deposits
a percentage (usually 10%) of the full
bail amount with the court.  The
percentage of the bail is returned after
the disposition of the case, but the court
often retains a small portion for
administrative costs.  If the defendant
fails to appear in court, he or she is
liable to the court for the full amount 
of the bail. 

Full cash bond -- The defendant posts
the full bail amount in cash with the
court.  If the defendant makes all court
appearances, the cash is returned.  If
the defendant fails to appear in court,
the bond is forfeited.

Property bond -- Involves an agreement
made by a defendant as a condition of
pretrial release requiring that property
valued at the full bail amount be posted
as an assurance of his or her appearance 
in court. If the defendant fails to appear 
in court, the property is forfeited. Also 
known as "collateral bond."  

Types of nonfinancial release

Release on recognizance (ROR) --
The court releases the defendant on 
a signed agreement that he or she will
appear in court as required.  In this
report, the ROR category includes
citation releases in which arrestees 
are released pending their first court
appearance on a written order issued by
law enforcement or jail personnel. 

Unsecured bond -- The defendant pays no 
money to the court but is liable for the 
full amount of bail should he or she fail 
to appear in court.

Conditional release -- Defendants are
released under specified conditions. If
monitoring or supervised is required, 
this usually done by a pretrial services
agency.  In some cases, such as those
involving a third-party custodian or 
drug monitoring and treatment, another
agency may be involved in the supervision 
of the defendant. Conditional release 
sometimes includes an unsecured bond.

Other type of release

Emergency release -- Defendants are
released in response to a court order
placing limits on a jail's population.
