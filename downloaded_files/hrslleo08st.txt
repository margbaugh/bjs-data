----------------------------------------------
In 2008, the United States had roughly 16,000 general purpose 
state and local law enforcement agencies, including local 
police departments, sheriffs’ offices, and the 50 primary 
state agencies. These agencies employed about 705,000 full-
time sworn personnel (table 1).
 
From 1992 to 2008, the number of sworn personnel employed by 
general purpose agencies increased by about 141,000, or 25% 
(figure 1). The 1.6% average annual growth rate for the 
number of officers exceeded that of the U.S. population 
(1.2%). Sheriffs’ offices (34% overall, 2.1% annually) had a 
higher growth rate over the 16-year period than local police 
departments (23%, 1.4%) or state agencies (15%, 0.9%).

The agencies hired about 61,000 officers in 2008, but lost 
about 51,000 through resignations, retirements, and other 
types of separation for a net gain of about 10,000 officers 
(figure 2) or 1.4% (table 2). 

Most agencies used specific strategies and policies designed 
to help them meet the challenges of recruiting, hiring, and 
retaining qualified sworn personnel. To better understand 
these efforts, a special survey was administered to a 
nationally representative sample of approximately 3,000 
general purpose agencies as part of the 2008 BJS Census of 
State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA). (See 
Methodology for details.)

*********************
Officer separations
*********************

Types of separation
-------------------
* Overall, about 7% of state and local officers separated 
from agencies during 2008. The separation rate from agencies 
with fewer than 10 officers (20%) was 4 times the rate of 
agencies with 500 or more officers (5%) (figure 3). 

* About two-thirds (65%) of all agencies had at least one 
officer separate in 2008. Nearly all agencies with 100 or 
more sworn personnel lost officers (table 3).

* Officer separations in 2008 included resignations (54%), 
nonmedical retirements (23%), dismissals (10%), probationary 
rejections (5%), and medical or disability retirements (5%) 
(table 4).

* Resignations accounted for more than half of the 
separations from sheriffs’ offices (56%) and local police 
departments (55%), compared to less than a third from state 
agencies (30%).

* About half (52%) of the separations from state agencies in 
2008 were attributable to nonmedical retirements, compared to 
less than a quarter from local police departments (23%) and 
sheriffs’ offices (19%).

* Among agencies with 500 or more officers, the percentage of 
separations in 2008 resulting from nonmedical retirements was 
higher in state law enforcement agencies (54%) than local 
police departments (41%) or sheriffs’ offices (32%).

* Resignations accounted for nearly twice the percentage of 
separations in agencies with fewer than 10 officers (71%) as 
agencies with 500 or more officers (37%) (figure 4). 

* Nonmedical retirements accounted for 41% of officer 
departures in agencies with 500 or more officers in 2008, 
compared with 5% of the separations from agencies employing 
fewer than 10 officers.

Mandatory retirement policies
------------------------------

* In 2008, 10% of all agencies, employing 21% of officers, 
had a mandatory retirement age for officers. About 1 in 4 
agencies with 500 or more officers had a mandatory retirement 
age, compared to 1 in 20 agencies with fewer than 10 officers 
(table 5). 

* Among agencies with 500 or more officers, state law 
enforcement agencies (52%) were more likely than local police 
departments (24%) or sheriffs’ offices (3%) to have a 
mandatory retirement age.
 
* The most common mandatory retirement age used by state and 
local law enforcement agencies in 2008 was age 65 (42%). 
Other jurisdictions reported mandatory retirement ages of 60 
(21%), 70 (13%), 63 (10%), 62 (8%), and 55 (4%) (not in a 
table).

* In agencies with a mandatory retirement age, nonmedical 
retirements accounted for 44% of separations, compared to 20% 
among agencies without a retirement age (not in a table).

*******************************************
Military reservists called to active duty
******************************************

* In 2008, 19% of agencies had about 7,500 full-time sworn 
personnel who were called to active military duty (table 6). 
This was a decrease from 2003 when 23% of agencies had 11,400 
officers called to active duty (not in a table).

* Nearly all agencies employing 500 or more sworn personnel 
had officers called to active duty in both 2003 (99%) and 
2008 (99%) (2003 data not in a table). 

* As in 2003, agencies with fewer than 10 officers (5%) were 
the least likely to have officers called to active duty in 
2008. 

* Of all full-time sworn personnel, 1.1% got called to active 
military duty in 2008, compared to 1.7% in 2003. In agencies 
that had officers called, 1.5% of all officers got called to 
active duty in 2008, compared to 2.2% in 2003 (2003 data not 
in a table) (figure 5).

* Among agencies employing fewer than 10 sworn personnel that 
had officers called to active duty in 2008, call-ups affected 
about 21% of their total number of full-time sworn personnel, 
compared to about 1% in the largest agencies. A similar 
effect was observed in 2003 (23% and 1.5%) (not in a table).

************************
Recruitment of officers
************************

Recruitment methods
-------------------

* About 9 in 10 agencies actively recruited applicants for 
sworn positions during 2008 (not in a table).

* Most agencies with 100 or more officers had a dedicated 
recruiting budget in 2008. Among agencies with 25 to 99 
officers, about half of local police departments had a 
recruiting budget, compared to about a quarter of sheriffs’ 
offices (table 7).
 
* Among agencies with a recruiting budget, the overall mean 
was $13,700 (not in a table) and the median was $2,000 (table 
8). 

* Among agencies with 500 or more officers, the median 
recruiting budget was $50,000, compared to $1,000 in agencies 
with fewer than 10 officers.

* About 8 in 10 agencies with 500 or more sworn personnel and 
about 5 in 10 agencies with 100 to 499 officers had a full-
time recruitment manager (table 9). 

* Among agencies with recruitment managers, nearly all 
employed either one (79%) or two (14%). About 85% of agencies 
employed only sworn personnel in the position, 8% employed 
only civilians, and 7% used both sworn and civilian personnel 
(not in a table).

* About 7 in 10 agencies used newspaper advertisements (69%) 
for recruitment purposes, with little variation by size 
category (table 10). A majority of agencies (59%) also used 
personal contacts, including about 3 in 4 agencies employing 
100 or more officers.

* A majority of agencies in each size category of 10 officers 
or more used the internet in 2008 to recruit applicants. 
Agencies with 500 or more officers (96%) were nearly 3 times 
as likely to use internet advertising as those with fewer 
than 10 officers (36%).

* Most agencies employing 100 or more officers used job fairs 
and special events in 2008 to recruit applicants (table 11). 

* In 2008 a majority of officers were employed by an agency 
that used agency websites (78%), personal contacts (74%), 
newspapers (71%), job fairs (70%), employment websites (62%), 
or special events (56%) to recruit applicants for sworn 
positions (figure 6).

Recruitment incentives
-----------------------

* To attract applicants for sworn positions, many agencies 
offered financial support to defray or eliminate the costs of 
recruit training. A majority (57%) of agencies offered these 
types of incentives including nearly all (99%) agencies with 
500 or more officers (table 12).

* About 1 in 2 state law enforcement agencies offered college 
tuition reimbursement to new recruits in 2008, compared to 
about 1 in 4 local police departments and 1 in 8 sheriffs’ 
offices. A majority of local police departments with 25 or 
more officers used this incentive.

* In 2008 most officers were employed by an agency that paid 
their salary during academy training (81%), offered free 
academy training (71%), or reimbursed them for college 
tuition (57%) (figure 7). 

* Small percentages of officers worked for agencies that 
offered incentives such as flexible hours to allow college 
attendance (12%), a signing bonus (7%), an academy graduation 
bonus (7%), or relocation assistance (5%) to recruit 
applicants.

Targeted recruitment efforts
----------------------------

* About half of agencies employing 100 or more officers and a 
third of agencies employing fewer than 100 targeted 
applicants who possessed prior law enforcement experience for 
sworn positions (table 13).

* Most agencies (4 in 5) with 100 or more officers targeted 
women and minorities with special recruitment efforts in 2008 
(table 14). Among larger agencies, state agencies were the 
most likely to target women and minorities, and sheriffs’ 
offices were the least likely. 

* Women represented 12.1% of the officers in agencies that 
targeted female applicants in 2008, compared to 10.6% of 
officers in agencies that did not. Likewise, the percentage 
of minority officers was larger in agencies that targeted 
such applicants (24.3%) than in agencies that did not (18.9%) 
(not in a table). 

* In 2008 most officers worked for an agency that targeted 
minorities (59%) and women (56%) for employment. About half 
worked for an agency that targeted military veterans (51%), 
applicants with prior law enforcement experience (45%), and 
multi-lingual persons (42%)(figure 8).

*********************************
Selection of officers
-----------------------

* As of 2007, more than 9 in 10 state and local officers were 
employed by an agency that screened recruits with criminal 
and driver records checks, background investigations, and 
medical and psychological exams (figure 9). More than 8 in 10 
officers worked for an agency that used physical agility or 
fitness tests, credit history checks, and written aptitude 
tests.

* As of 2006, basic recruit training programs included more 
than 1,200 classroom and field hours on average. Of those 
recruits who started a training program in 2005, 14% failed 
to complete it (not in a table) (see State and Local Law 
Enforcement Training Academies, 2006).

* In 2008, 5% of post-academy recruits did not successfully 
complete the probationary period with their hiring agency 
(not in a table). Therefore, it is estimated that for every 
122 officer recruits, agencies obtained 100 non-probationary 
post-academy officers.

* In order to increase the pool of applicants for sworn 
positions, an estimated 84% of agencies had a policy in 2008 
that allowed for some applicant screening criteria to be 
relaxed at times within agency-specified parameters (such as 
severity, frequency, or time elapsed) (not in a table). 

* A majority of agencies in all size categories were willing 
to consider applicants with prior credit-related problems, 
including about 90% of those employing 100 or more officers 
(table 15). 

* A majority of agencies in all size categories were willing 
to consider applicants with a misdemeanor conviction, 
including more than 80% of agencies employing 100 or more 
officers.

* Nearly half (47%) of agencies allowed the hiring of 
applicants with prior marijuana use, including more than 80% 
of agencies with 100 or more officers. Overall, a sixth of 
agencies considered hiring applicants that used illegal drugs 
other than marijuana, including more than half of agencies 
with 100 or more officers.

* About 4 in 10 agencies were willing to consider applicants 
with prior driving-related problems such as a suspended 
license or a conviction for driving under the influence. 
Nearly 9 in 10 agencies with 100 or more officers had such 
a policy. 

* In 2008, more than two-thirds of officers worked for 
agencies that allowed the consideration of highly qualified 
applicants whose personal history included prior credit-
related problems (82%), marijuana use (76%), a misdemeanor 
conviction (75%), a suspended driver’s license (72%), or 
job-related problems (71%) (figure 10).

* In 2008, nearly all state agencies (98%) had a residency 
requirement, compared to 65% of sheriffs’ offices and 38% 
of local police departments (table 16). 

* About half of state agencies (51%) and sheriffs’ offices 
(49%) required officers to live within a specified service 
area, compared to 8% of local police departments.

********************
Hiring of officers
********************

* About two-thirds (68%) of all agencies hired at least one 
full-time officer during 2008. Nearly all (95%) agencies with 
100 or more officers had at least one new hire, compared to 
about half (53%) of agencies with fewer than 10 officers 
(table 17). 

* More than half (57%) of all agencies hired at least one 
officer at the entry level (no prior law enforcement 
experience) during 2008. This included about 9 in 10 agencies 
employing 100 or more officers and about 4 in 10 agencies 
employing fewer than 10 officers.

* In 2008, 81% of all new officer hires were at the entry 
level. The proportion of new hires that were entry level 
ranged from about 9 in 10 among agencies with 500 or more 
officers to about 7 in 10 among agencies with fewer than 25 
officers (table 18).
 
* An estimated 14% of hires by state and local law 
enforcement agencies in 2008 were lateral hires (those with 
experience as a sworn officer for a minimum time, such as 5 
years, who were already employed by a law enforcement agency 
(or had only a brief break in service).
 
* Officers newly hired during the year accounted for about 9% 
of all full-time sworn personnel working in state and local 
law enforcement agencies in 2008 (figure 11). This percentage 
ranged from 7% in the largest agencies to 23% in the 
smallest. 

* New entry-level hires accounted for about 7% of all state 
and local officers in 2008, ranging from 6% in the largest 
agencies to 17% in the smallest agencies.

Retention of officers
***********************

Retention strategies
---------------------

* In 2008, 19% of agencies required new officers to sign a 
minimum time-of-service agreement. Among agencies with 
service agreements, most required either a 2-year (43%) 
or 3-year (32%) service term (not in a table). 

* About 9% of officers were employed by a state or local law 
enforcement agency with a 2-year time-of-service agreement, 
and 5% by one with a 3-year time-of-service agreement (not in 
a table).

* Many agencies used financial incentives to increase officer 
retention rates in 2008. About two-thirds (65%) of agencies 
offered free uniforms or a financial allowance for uniform-
related expenses (table 19). 

* About half of agencies offered increased pay at specific 
service milestones (55%) or take-home vehicles (46%) to 
officers. Local police departments (37%) were less likely to 
offer take-home vehicles to officers than state agencies 
(83%) or sheriffs’ offices (80%).

* In 2008, about 8 in 10 officers worked for an agency that 
offered free or subsidized uniforms. More than 7 in 10 worked 
for an agency with pay raises at service milestones (figure 
12). 

* More than 4 in 10 officers worked for an agency that 
offered take-home vehicles or a pay raise for a college 
degree.

Overtime and outside employment policies
----------------------------------------

* Nearly all (95%) agencies allowed officers to work overtime 
in 2008. About 4 in 5 agencies (78%) did not limit the amount 
of overtime that could be worked (table 20).

* Nearly all (93%) agencies allowed officers to earn extra 
income by working at a second job; however, most agencies 
limited the number of hours worked outside of the agency and 
the types of establishments where officers could work (table 
21). 

* About two-fifths of agencies with fewer than 10 officers 
allowed outside employment without restrictions.

* Nearly all officers were employed by an agency that allowed 
them to earn additional income through overtime (99%) or 
outside employment (98%) during 2008. About 70% of officers 
worked for an agency that allowed them to earn unlimited 
overtime, compared to 7% who worked for an agency that 
allowed unrestricted outside employment (figure 13).

Pension and exit interview policies
------------------------------------

* About 9 in 10 agencies offered full-service retirement 
pensions to officers during 2008. At least 96% of the 
agencies in each size category employing 10 officers or more 
had a pension plan, compared to 85% of agencies with fewer 
than 10 officers.
 
* Retirement plans varied, but the minimum service 
requirement was most commonly 20 or 25 years, and minimum 
qualifying age was 50 or 55 (table 22).

* Agencies with 500 or more officers (81%) were nearly 
3 times as likely to conduct exit interviews as agencies with 
fewer than 10 officers (30%). State agencies were the most 
likely type of agency to conduct exit interviews (table 23).

Methodology
************

Sample design 
---------------

The data analyzed for this report are from a supplement to 
the 2008 BJS Census of State and Local Law Enforcement 
Agencies (CSLLEA). The sample, based on the 2007 Law 
Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics Survey 
(LEMAS), included 3,095 state and local law enforcement 
agencies. The sample was designed to be representative of all 
general purpose state and local law enforcement agencies in 
the United States, with separate samples for local police 
departments and sheriffs’ offices. 

Agencies serving special jurisdictions (such as schools, 
airports, or parks) or with special enforcement 
responsibilities (such as conservation or alcohol laws) were 
out of scope for the survey. Sheriffs’ offices without 
primary law enforcement jurisdiction were also out of scope. 

The survey included all agencies employing 100 or more full-
time sworn personnel and a systematic random sample of 
smaller agencies. Because sampling was used for smaller 
agencies, some of the statistics presented in the report are 
subject to sampling error. Statements of comparison have been 
tested at the 95%-confidence level.
 
The final sample includes 942 self-representing (SR) agencies 
with 100 or more sworn personnel, and 2,153 non self-
representing (NSR) agencies employing fewer than 100 sworn 
personnel. The SR agencies include 589 local police 
departments, 303 sheriffs’ offices, and 50 state law 
enforcement agencies. 

The NSR local police agencies were selected using a 
stratified random sample with cells based on the number of 
sworn personnel. The NSR sheriffs’ offices were selected 
using a simple random sample. Overall, the NSR sample 
included 1,504 local police departments and 615 sheriffs’ 
offices. All SR and NSR agencies received the two-page CSLLEA 
supplement containing questions on retention and recruitment 
in addition to the standard two-page CSLLEA questionnaire.

Agency response rate 
--------------------

A total of 3,006 agencies completed the two-page CSLLEA 
supplement for a response rate of 97%. This included 918 SR 
agencies (97%) and 2,088 NSR agencies (97%). The response 
rate for local police departments was 98%; for sheriffs’ 
offices, 95%; and for state law enforcement agencies, 94%. 
The final database includes 2,053 local police departments, 
906 sheriffs’ offices, and 47 state agencies.
 
Weighting
---------

The base weight for all SR agencies is 1.00. For NSR 
sheriffs’ offices, the base weight is 4.19. For NSR local 
police departments with 63 to 99 officers, the base weight is 
2.15; with 40 to 62 officers, 3.37; with 24 to 39 officers, 
4.97; with 14 to 23 officers, 7.09; with 7 to 13 officers, 
9.86; and with fewer than 7 officers, 18.70. 

The final weight associated with every agency, both SR and 
NSR, is the product of the base weight and a factor that 
adjusted for the number of agencies in each sample cell that 
did not respond. For all state law enforcement agencies, the 
final weight is 1.06. For SR sheriffs’ offices, the final 
weight is 1.04, and for NSR sheriffs’ offices, the final 
weight is 4.40. The final weight for all SR local police 
departments is 1.02. For NSR local police departments with 63 
to 99 officers, the final weight is 2.20; with 40 to 62 
officers, 3.40; with 24 to 39 officers, 5.13; with 14 to 23 
officers, 7.09; with 7 to 13 officers, 10.17; and with fewer 
than 7 officers, 19.38. 

To compute officer-based percentages, the final weight for an 
agency was multiplied by the proportion of all full-time 
equivalent sworn officers employed by that agency. The number 
of full-time equivalent sworn officers was defined as the sum 
of the number of full-time sworn officers and half the number 
of part-time sworn officers.

Item nonresponse
-----------------

For the 3,006 agencies completing the supplemental 
questionnaire, item nonresponse rates due to omission or 
invalid data were quite low. For most categorical items, the 
nonresponse rate was under 1% (appendix table 1). 

Imputations
------------

When an agency did not supply a response to a numeric item 
related to number of hires and separations, a ratio 
imputation was used. The imputations used the mean value of 
the ratio of the missing value relative to the number of 
full-time sworn personnel as reported by other agencies in 
the same sample cell. Imputations were not used for 
categorical items.

Accuracy of the estimates
--------------------------

The accuracy of the estimates presented in this report 
depends on two types of error: sampling and nonsampling. 
Sampling error is the variation that may occur by chance 
because a sample rather than a complete enumeration of the 
population was conducted. Nonsampling error can be attributed 
to many sources such as the inability to obtain information 
about all cases in the sample, inability to obtain complete 
and correct information from the administrative records, and 
processing errors. The full extent of the non-sampling error 
is never known in a sample. The sampling error, as measured 
by an estimated standard error, varies by the size of the 
estimate and the size of the base population.
