was 21% greater than the comparable combined totals of the 
INS, U.S. Customs Service, and Federal Protective Service 
in 2002.

* Women accounted for 16% of Federal officers in 2004. A 
third of Federal officers were members of a racial or 
ethnic minority in 2004. This included 17.7% who were 
Hispanic or Latino, and 11.4% who were black or African 
American.

* About half of the Federal officers in the U.S. were 
employed in Texas (14,633), California (13,365), the 
District of Columbia (9,201), New York (8,159), or 
Florida (6,627). New Hampshire and Delaware, with 112

* Nationwide, there were 36 Federal officers per 100,000 
residents. Outside the District of Columbia, which had 
1,662 per 100,000, State ratios ranged from 90 per 
100,000 in Arizona to 7 per 100,000 in Iowa.
-----------------------------------------------

As of September 2004, Federal agencies employed approximately 
105,000 full-time personnel authorized to make arrests and 
carry firearms in the 50 States and the District of Columbia. 
Compared with 2002, employment of such personnel increased by 
13%.

The survey also found that about 1,500 officers were employed 
in U.S. Territories, primarily in Puerto Rico. No data were 
obtained on Federal officers stationed in foreign countries.

These findings come from the 2004 Census of Federal Law
Enforcement Officers conducted by the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics(BJS). This was the first such census conducted by 
BJS since legislation creating the Department of Homeland 
Security was signed in November 2002. 

The 2004 Census covered 65 agencies, including 27 offices of 
inspector general. The officer counts include supervisory and 
nonsupervisory personnel with Federal arrest authority who 
were also authorized (but not necessarily required) to carry
firearms while on duty. They exclude officers in the U.S. 
Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Coast Guard). 
Because of classified information restrictions, the CIA and the
Transportation Security Administration's Federal Air Marshals 
are also excluded. 

The largest number of Federal officers, 40,408, performed
criminal investigation and enforcement duties (38%). The 
next largest category, with 22,278 officers, was police 
response and patrol (21%). A total of 17,280 officers 
performed inspections (16%)related to immigration or customs 
laws, and 16,530 performed corrections or detention-related
duties (16%). Others had duties related to court operations
(5%) or security and protection (4%).

Major employers of Federal officers

Agencies with 500 or more officers employed about 98,500, 
or 94%, of the Federal officers covered by the BJS census.

Department of Homeland Security 

In September 2004 the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), 
with 27,705 officers in the U.S., was the largest employer of 
Federal law enforcement officers. CBP was established May 1, 
2003, to combine the inspectional workforces and broad border 
authorities of the U.S. Customs Service, U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service (INS), the U.S. Border Patrol, and the 
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. CBP is tasked with 
stopping terrorists, terrorist weapons, illegal drugs, aliens, 
and materials harmful to agriculture from entering at, or 
between, ports of entry.

The CBP total included 10,895 Border Patrol officers in 2004, 
about 1,100, or 11%, more than in 2002. These officers 
perform patrol and response functions along, and in the 
vicinity of, the 8,000 miles of U.S. boundaries. In 2004, 89% 
of border control officers were stationed in the four States 
bordering Mexico.  

CBP employed nearly 17,000 officers who were INS or U.S.
Customs Inspectors before the creation of DHS. These CBP 
officers are included in the inspections category.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is another 
major law enforcement component of DHS. ICE is organized 
into four major offices: Investigations, Intelligence, 
Detention and Removal Operations, and Federal Protective 
Service (FPS)(transferred from GSA in 2003). 
 
The primary mission of ICE is to prevent acts of terrorism
by targeting the people, money, and materials that support 
terrorist and criminal activities. ICE is the largest 
investigative arm of DHS, and is responsible for identifying 
and eliminating vulnerabilities in the nation's border,
economic, transportation and infrastructure security.

In September 2004, ICE employed 10,399 officers with arrest
and firearms authority. This included about 8,000 agents 
involved with criminal investigations and enforcement, about 
900 officers performing detention and deportation functions,
about 800 providing response and patrol services, and about 
600 providing security and protection services.  

Included among these ICE officers were 1,119 FPS officers
performing security, patrol, and investigative duties related 
to Federal buildings and property, and the employees and 
visitors using them. This was an increase of 50% over 2002 
FPS levels.

The combined officer employment of CBP and ICE in 2004 was
38,104, 21% more than the comparable combined totals of the 
INS, U.S. Customs Service, and Federal Protective Service in
2002.

The next largest DHS employer, the U.S. Secret Service, had
4,769 personnel authorized to make arrests and carry firearms 
in 2004, an increase of 500, or 12%, over 2002. About two-
thirds of Secret Service officers were special agents with
investigation and enforcement duties primarily related to 
counterfeiting, financial crimes, computer fraud, and threats 
against dignitaries. 

Most other Secret Service officers were in the Uniformed
Division. These officers provide protection for the White 
House complex and other Presidential offices, the Main 
Treasury Building and Annex, the President and Vice 
President and their immediate families, and foreign
diplomatic missions. The Secret Service was moved to DHS
from the Treasury Department in 2003.

Department of Justice

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), the second largest
employer of Federal officers overall, and the largest in 
the Justice Department, employed 15,214 correctional 
officers in September 2004. This was about 900, or 6%, more 
than in 2002. These officers maintain the security of the
Federal Prison System. Their duties include supervising
inmates, searching for contraband, and responding to 
emergencies and disturbances. As of September 2004, BOP 
institutions had about 153,000 inmates in custody.

The BJS census limited the BOP count to correctional officers 
and others who deal directly with inmates, such as correctional 
counselors and captains. Most other BOP employees have arrest
and firearm authority so they may respond to emergencies and
disturbances as needed.

The next largest employer of Federal officers, the FBI, had
12,242 full-time personnel with arrest and firearm authority 
in 2004.  This was about 1,000, or 9%, more than in 2002. 
Except for 240 FBI police officers, all were special agents, 
responsible for criminal investigation and enforcement.
 
Among the FBI's stated top priorities are protecting the U.S. 
from terrorist attacks and from foreign intelligence operations. 
Other priorities include combating cyber crime, white-collar
crime, violent crime, organized crime, and public corruption. 
Protecting civil rights also continues to be a priority. 

The DEA had an estimated 4,400 employees with arrest and
firearm authority in the U.S. as of September 2004. This was 
about 400, or 10%, more than in 2002. DEA special agents 
investigate major narcotics violators, enforce regulations 
governing the manufacture and dispensing of controlled 
substances, and perform other functions to prevent and 
control drug trafficking.    

The U.S. Marshals Service employed 3,233 officers with arrest 
and firearm authority in 2004, an increase of about 600, or 
22%, over 2002 levels. The Marshals Service receives all 
persons arrested by Federal agencies and is responsible 
for their custody and transportation until sentencing. 
With BOP assistance, it transfers sentenced Federal 
inmates between facilities.

The Marshals Service also has jurisdiction over Federal
fugitive matters concerning escaped prisoners, probation 
and parole violators, persons under DEA warrants, and 
defendants released on bond. The agency makes more than 
half of all Federal fugitive arrests. Other responsibilities
include managing the Federal Witness Security and Federal
Asset Seizure and Forfeiture Programs, and security for 
Federal judicial facilities and personnel. 

The fifth largest employer in the Department of Justice, the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ATF),had 
2,373 full-time officers with arrest and firearm authority in
2004, 2% more than in 2002. ATF enforces Federal laws related 
to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, explosives, and arson. ATF 
moved to the Department of Justice from the Department of the
Treasury in 2003.

500 or more officers

As of September 2004 the Federal Corrections and Supervision
Division of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts 
employed approximately 4,600 probation officers, all of whom

districts where the court authorizes officers to carry 
firearms while on duty (see the box below). 

The U.S. Postal Inspection Service employed 2,976 officers
in 2004, 5% fewer than in 2002. About two-thirds of these 
officers were postal inspectors, responsible for criminal 
investigations covering more than 200 Federal statutes 
related to the postal system. The others were postal
police officers who provide security for postal facilities,
employees, and assets, and  escort high-value mail shipments.  

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employed 2,777 special
agents with arrest and firearm authority within its Criminal 
Investigation Division in 2004, a decrease of 3% from 2002.

the Nation's tax laws.  

The Veteran's Health Administration (VHA) employed 2,423
officers with arrest and firearm authority as of September

These officers provide police services for VHA medical centers 
nationwide.

The National Park Service employed 2,148 full-time personnel
with arrest and firearm authority in 2004. This included 1,536 
park rangers commissioned as law enforcement officers. Additional
rangers serving seasonally were commissioned officers but were 
considered part-time and not included in the BJS census. The 
Park Service total also includes 612 U.S. Park Police officers.
These officers work mostly in the Washington, D.C., area, but 
are authorized to provide police services for the entire 
National Park System.

The U.S. Capitol Police employed 1,535 officers to provide
police services for the U.S. Capitol grounds and buildings

Police full law enforcement authority in an extended 
jurisdiction zone covering the area immediately
surrounding the Capitol complex.

The Department of State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security
employed an estimated 825 officers in 2004 with the

of Federal wildlife protection laws and treaties.

The USDA Forest Service employed 600 law enforcement
officers in 2004, a 9% decrease from 2002. These officers

an increase of 155, or 47%, over 2002. The PFPA, formerly the 
Defense Protective Service(DPS), was established in May 2004 
to expand on the DPS mission of basic law enforcement and 
security to provide force protection against the full
spectrum of potential threats. The PFPA provides services to

officers in the District and New York were employed by 
the U.S. Park Police.   

Alaska, California and Texas each accounted for 6% of U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service personnel with arrest and firearm 
authority. Next highest were Virginia, Florida, and North 
Dakota with 5% each.

The USDA Forest Service employed nearly a fifth of its law
enforcement officers in California (19%). Next were Oregon 
and Montana with 7% each.

Exhibit A. Training for Federal officers

A majority of Federal officers receive some or all of their 
training through the Federal Law Enforcement Training 
Center (FLETC). Among the exceptions are special agents 
with the FBI and DEA, who complete basic training at their 
respective academies in Quantico, Virginia. 

The FLETC, previously a bureau of the Department of the 
Treasury, became a part of the Department of Homeland 
Security during 2003. It serves more than 70 Federal 
agencies, as well as State, local, and international law 
enforcement communities. 

About half of FLETC training instructors are permanent 
employees. The remainder are Federal officers on short-
term assignment from participating agencies.  

The basic training requirements for Federal officers vary by 
agency and by position within agencies. Overall, the FLETC 
offers more than 100 different agency-specific training 
programs. 

In fiscal 2004, the FLETC provided about 150,000 student 
weeks of training to nearly 45,000 personnel. Of the total 
student weeks, 74% were in basic programs. The FLETC Glynco 
facility provided 71% of all training as measured in student
weeks.

The FLETC Artesia Training Division in New Mexico accounted 
for 13% of student training weeks. FLETC-Artesia is 
responsible for advanced and specialized training programs 
for the United States Border Patrol, Bureau of Indian Affairs, 
Transportation Security Administration, and other partnering 
organizations. 

The FLETC facility in Charleston, South Carolina accounted 
for 10% of student training weeks. In December 2004 the U.S. 
Coast Guard officially consolidated its Maritime Law 
Enforcement School and its Boarding Team Member School into 
a new Coast Guard Maritime Law Enforcement Academy in 
Charleston. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, 
Federal Probation and Pretrial Services established its 
academy at FLETC-Charleston in January 2005. 

A fourth FLETC training facility opened in Cheltenham, 
Maryland in 2004, to provide advanced and in-service 
firearms and vehicle operations requalification and other 
continuing professional training to over 18,000 Federal 
law enforcement officers in the Washington, D.C. Area.  
It is also the home of the U.S. Capitol Police Training 
Academy.

The FLETC also provides a wide range of training courses 
at export training sites around the country which accounted 
for 3% of training hours. In addition the FLETC operates 
facilities in Botswana and Costa Rica.

CBP record the most student weeks trained through the FLETC 
during FY 2004, about 49,000. This included about 19,000 
weeks of training for Border Patrol agents. ICE had the 
second most training, about 21,000 student weeks. 

Other agencies with large numbers of training weeks included: 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 21,371; Air Force 
Office of Special Investigations, 5,705; Bureau of Prisons, 
5,559; Customs and Immigration Services, 5,518; U.S. Secret 
Service, 5,397; Internal Revenue Service, 5,036; 
Transportation Security Administration, 3,999; and Bureau 
of Indian Affairs, 3,546.

Exhibit B. Growth in Department of Homeland 
Security Agencies

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the two 
major law enforcement components of the Department of 
Homeland Security created in 2002, were significantly 
larger in 2004 than their pre-DHS predecessors were 8 
years earlier. For example, CBP's U.S. Border Patrol, 
formerly part of Immigration and Naturalization Service 
(INS), roughly doubled in size in 8 years-—from 5,441 
officers in 1996 to 10,895 in 2004.

In addition to the 100% increase in the Border Patrol, 
there were 75% more customs and immigration inspectors in 
the CBP in 2004 (16,786) than the combined number of 
inspectors employed by the INS and the Customs Service in 
1996 (9,598).  
 
The number of ICE criminal investigators in 2004 was 49% 
greater than the combined number of INS and Customs agents 
in 1996, increasing from 5,399 to 8,029. 

The Federal Protective Service, moved from GSA to ICE in 
2003, had 74% more officers in 2004(1,119)than in 1996(643).  

After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the 
newly created Transportation Security Administration 
conducted a major expansion of the Federal Air Marshals 
program, training and hiring thousands of officers to 
provide security on commercial airline flights. Since 
the expansion began, exact employment numbers have not 
been available, but recent estimates place them in the 
3,000-4,000 range.

Exhibit C. Federal law enforcement officers killed 
or assaulted, 2004

The Uniform Crime Reports Division of the FBI publishes data 
annually on law enforcement officers killed or assaulted in 
the United States and its territories. Agencies participating 
in the Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted (LEOKA) 
provided data on 681 assaults on Federal officers that occurred 
during 2004.  A total of 144, or 21%, of these assaults 
resulted in personal injury to the officer. No Federal officers 
were feloniously killed during the year.

Nearly half of assaults on Federal officers occurred during 
patrol or guard duty (47%). Twenty percent were assaulted 
making an arrest or serving a summons and 13% while 
conducting an investigation or search.

About 39% of these assaults  involved the use of personal 
weapons such as hands, fists, or feet.  About 20% involved 
threats, 10% firearms, and 10% the use a vehicle. Among 
assaults resulting in injury to an officer, 69% involved 
personal weapons, 13% a vehicle, and 5% a firearm. 

Based on agencies providing 2004 LEOKA data, the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs (BIA) had the highest assault rate per 100 
officers, 33.8.  The next highest rates were at the National 
Park Service (5.2), the U.S. Marshals Service (1.5), and 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) (0.9). Although 
not broken out in LEOKA, data indicate that most assaults 
against CBP officers involve Border Patrol agents — resulting 
in an assault rate for the Border Patrol that is considerably 
higher than the overall rate for the CBP.

When only assaults that resulted in death or injury are 
considered, the BIA had a rate of 5.3 per 100, more than 
three times the next highest rate of 1.5 per 100 at the 
National Park Service.

Methodological notes

Bureau of Prisons (BOP) officers and other staff are 
authorized to make arrests on or off BOP premises for 
assault of an officer, escape, or assisting escape; on 
BOP premises for theft, depredation or destruction of 
property, contraband, mutiny or riot, or trespassing; 
and on BOP premises for other offenses to safeguard 
security, good order, or government property. BOP policy 
provides that such an arrest may be made when staff has 
probable cause to believe that a person has committed one 
of these offenses and there is likelihood of the person 
escaping before a warrant can be issued.

The DEA provided aggregate data for agents worldwide by 
race and gender. Using prior years, an estimate for the 
U.S. and its territories was derived from these data. 
State employment totals are estimated based on the 
distribution of DEA agents by State as reported to BJS in 
2002. The race and gender data were derived by applying the 
percentages from the worldwide data to estimated  totals 
for the U.S. and its territories.  

The Secret Service did not provide State employment totals. 
They were estimated using State populations.  

The Bureau of Diplomatic Security provided aggregate data 
and race and gender data for FY 2005. These were combined 
with 2002 data to produce estimates for 2004.  

The U.S. Supreme Court Police did not provide any data for 
2002 or 2004. An estimated total for 2004 was derived from 
other sources and the race and gender totals were estimated 
using data provided by the Supreme Court Police to BJS in 
2000.
