Foreword
----------

This publication is a report on criminal victimization and
citizen perceptions in 12 cities across the United States.  
The findings reported are the result of a joint effort between 
the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) and 
the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to supplement the National 
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) with questions related to 
community policing.  

This project was designed to assess the use of Random Digit
Dialing (RDD) Telephone Methodology at the local level using the
NCVS and community attitude questions.  The results presented
here are intended to serve as a basis for new studies and
improved methodologies.

The NCVS has been providing national statistics on criminal
victimization for more than 20 years and continues to be the
primary source for data on the characteristics of criminal
victimizations that have occurred across the Nation. The NCVS
collects information on both victimizations reported to the
police and those that were not reported.

In response to informational demands from the law enforcement
community, BJS and the COPS Office initiated the groundbreaking
effort to collect city-level information on criminal
victimizations, perceptions, and satisfaction with local police.
Questions on these topics were added to the NCVS and piloted in
12 cities.   

As the community policing philosophy continues to be adopted by
law enforcement agencies across the country, agencies have
become more interested in using surveys as a tool to solicit
feedback and community participation, both of which are critical
to community policing efforts. Surveys may be used to foster a
relationship between the community and law enforcement.  They
can also be used to evaluate the impact of activities and
programs on community perceptions and satisfaction levels,
enhance service delivery by evaluating satisfaction levels, or
facilitate better information exchange on community concerns. 

The goal of this project is to develop a survey instrument and
methodology that may be used by law enforcement agencies to
collect information on criminal victimizations, citizen
attitudes toward the police, their willingness to report crimes
to the police, and the impact of different community policing
strategies and tactics on crime and neighborhood conditions.  

One of the most significant results of this project is the
demonstration of the benefits of collecting this type of
information at the local level.  To assist local agencies to
administer community surveys, BJS and the COPS Office have
developed a desktop survey software package.  The software is
available to local law enforcement agencies seeking to collect
victimization and community information from citizens in their
jurisdictions. 

This Windows-based software can be ordered by contacting the BJS
Clearinghouse at 1-800-732-3277 or by e-mail ASKBJS@ojp.usdoj.gov

We believe this data collection effort has initiated a new
opportunity to support law enforcement. 

We gratefully acknowledge the assistance of the Bureau of the
Census, police departments in the 12 participating cities, those
who supplied questions or provided comments on the supplemental 
survey questions, and all the people who responded to the survey.

Victimization 
--------------

For the first time in 20 years, BJS conducted city-level surveys
on crime victimization.  These city surveys, different from the
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), used Random Digit
Dialing (RDD) to contact households.  Unlike the NCVS, findings
from these surveys do not represent national estimates.  

Among the 12 cities surveyed, violent crime victimization rates
ranged from 60 to 85 per 1,000 residents age 12 or older. 
Nationally, the 1997 violent crime victimization rate in urban
areas was 51 per 1,000 residents.

Nationally, black residents in urban areas have experienced a
higher rate of violent crime than urban whites.  This was also
the case in a majority of the 12 cities surveyed. 

In each of the cities, victims said that less than half of the
violent crimes involved a weapon.  In most of the cities, less
than half of the violent crime were reported to the police.

The percentage of violent crimes in which the offender was a
stranger to the victim ranged from 42% in Tucson to 74% in Los
Angeles.

Community attitudes
----------------------

Overall, about 80% or more of the residents in each of the 12
cities said they were satisfied with the quality of life in
their neighborhood. 

The percentage of residents in each city who said they were
fearful of crime in their neighborhood ranged from 20% to 48%. 
Ten percent or less in each city said they were "very fearful"
of neighborhood crime.  

In 11 of the cities, a third or more of the residents said they
were fearful of becoming a victim of street crime.  Residents 
fearful of street crime most frequently cited assault with a gun and
robbery as the street crimes they most feared.  

About a quarter to a half of the residents among the 12 cities
said they were aware that a serious crime had occurred in their
neighborhood in the past 12 months.  

In general, those aware of such crimes identified a range of
crimes such as theft of personal property, burglary, auto theft,
gun crimes, and the open sale or use of drugs as having 
occurred in their neighborhood.

Citizens said they were most likely to find out about
neighborhood crimes through conversations with their neighbors
or from the media.  Residents across the 12 cities were
generally less likely to have gained their information about
local crime from the police.

Survey question: "How fearful are you about crime in your
neighborhood?  Are you very fearful, somewhat fearful,
not very fearful, or not at all fearful?"

Percents reported combine "very fearful"
and "somewhat fearful."

Using sample data

Since the data in this report came from a sample, a sampling
error (standard error) is associated with each reported number.  
All differences discussed in the text are statistically significant at 
or above the 95%-confidence level.  As displayed in figure 1,
the reader is cautioned that some apparent differences between
and among the cities are not statistically significant.  All
stated differences in the text are tested at the 95%-confidence
level.  Standard error tables for selected estimates are
provided in Appendix II.
---------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
Citizen actions to prevent neighborhood crime 
----------------------------------------------

While neighborhood watch meetings were not widely attended, most
respondents in each city said they relied on neighbors to watch
out for each other.  

Residents fearful of street crime across the 12 cities most
frequently said that to protect themselves they avoided certain areas, 
going out at night, or going out alone.  About a quarter to a third of
residents fearful of street crime in each of the cities said
they had made an effort to get to know the police in their
neighborhood.

Another frequently cited security measure was the use of
automatic lighting around the house.  In several cities about a
third of the residents kept a weapon inside the home for
security. 

In 6 cities at least a fifth of the residents kept a weapon in
their home for self defense.

----------------------------------------------
Percent of residents who kept a self-defense 
weapon in their home, 1998

Question: "In the past 12 months, have
you done any of these things to protect
yourself from crime in the home, in a
direct response to you or your family's
fear of crime."  See table 25 for
complete list of response categories.
-------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Attitudes toward the police and community policing
---------------------------------------------------

About 30% or more of the residents in each city said they had
some level of contact with the police in the past 12 months.  

A majority of nearly 80% or more of the residents in each city
were satisfied with the police in their neighborhood.

In each of the 12 cities, residents fearful of neighborhood
crime were less likely to be satisfied with their local police
than those who were not fearful of crime in their neighborhood.  

Likewise, satisfaction with the local police was more widespread
among those who had not experienced a violent crime than those
who had.

Citizen familiarity with the term community policing varied
among the 12 cities.  About 25% of the citizens in Savannah
expressed familiarity, as did 60% or more of those in Chicago,
Madison, Springfield, and Washington, D.C. 

At least 40% of the residents in each city thought the police
practiced community policing in their neighborhood.

--------------------------------------
Percent of residents who said police 
are doing community policing, 1998
 
Chicago, IL          67%
Kansas City, MO      52
Knoxville, TN        42
Los Angeles, CA      50
 
Madison, WI          47
New York, NY         51
San Diego, CA        57
Savannah, GA         48
 
Spokane, WA          54
Springfield, MA      64
Tucson, AZ           46
Washington, DC       53

Question: "Community policing involves police
officers working with the community to address
the causes of crime in an effort to reduce
problems themselves and the associated fear,
through a wide range of activities.  Based on
this definition, do you think police in your
neighborhood practice community policing?"
---------------------------------------------


-------------------------
About the 12-city survey
-------------------------

BJS surveyed everyone age 12 or older in a representative sample
of approximately 800 households in each city.  Questions about
the neighborhood and community policing were asked only of
residents age 16 or older.

The Census Bureau used Random Digit Dialing (RDD) methodology to
contact sampled households. Phone lists were developed based on
zip codes and city boundary information.  This method is
different from the NCVS.

Interviews were conducted during February, March, April, and May
of 1998 from Census Bureau telephone call centers in Hagerstown,
MD, and Tucson, AZ.  

In addition to the standard questions from the NCVS, respondents
were asked new questions about their neighborhood and local
police.  The survey used a 12-month reference period.  

Violent crime findings from the city surveys can be compared to
crime reported to the police as published in the FBI's Uniform
Crime Reports (UCR).

Introduction
--------------

For the first time in 20 years, the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS) and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services
(COPS) sponsored city-level crime victimization surveys. The
Census Bureau conducted the surveys.  The National Institute of
Justice provided funding for the city survey in Washington, DC,
as part of its research support to the District of Columbia
Revitalization Initiative.

The 12 cities are listed below: 
* Chicago, Illinois
* Kansas City, Missouri
* Knoxville, Tennessee
* Los Angeles, California
* Madison, Wisconsin
* New York, New York
* San Diego, California
* Savannah, Georgia
* Spokane, Washington
* Springfield, Massachusetts
* Tucson, Arizona
* Washington, D.C.

Cities selected for the survey project had police departments
that represented varying stages in the development of community
policing.  The project surveyed sampled house- holds residing
within the selected cities' jurisdictional limits to account for
the area served by the local police department.  The survey did
not capture victimizations experienced by those who lived
outside the city limits but that may have occurred within the
city.  It does include victimizations reported by city residents
which may have occurred outside the city limits.  Respondents
were asked about their experiences with crime over the past 12
months.

The Nation's law enforcement community has increasingly
requested city-level information regarding crime victimizations
and citizen attitudes. BJS and COPS undertook this study to
examine how NCVS questions could be administered at a local
level using the RDD methodology. The purposes of the project
were to collect baseline data on city-level violent crime, to
measure fear of crime and community attitudes toward
neighborhoods and police, and to test the RDD methodology.  This
 project explored how to use telephone surveys to provide needed
information to police departments, citizens, and the criminal
justice research community.

Figure 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
The data from the surveys in each city are based on a sample of
households.  Therefore, the rates and numbers from each survey
are estimates and are not exact.  Figure 1 shows the violent
victimization rate for each city:  Each bar shows the range
within which the true victimization rate is likely to fall for
that city, and the dot represents the best estimate, the most
likely value for the rate in each city. There is a greater
likelihood that the true rate will fall near the best estimate,
and the bars reflect that likelihood: The darker the bar
segment, the greater the likelihood. 

Even though the best estimates of the victimization rates differ
between the cities, the bars overlap, meaning that it is
possible that the actual numbers are the same.  Therefore the
differences in the rates between cities may be too small to be
statistically significant.  

For example, the 68% probability ranges for violent crime rates
in Washington, D.C., and Tucson do not overlap, indicating that
the rates are statistically different for these cities at a 68%
confidence level. However, at the more likely levels of 90% or
95% of probability the rates in these two cities are not
statistically different; the ranges do overlap.  Likewise, at
the 95% level none of the cities surveyed had a violent crime
rate significantly different from any of the other cities.

sample surveys, see Displaying Violent Crime Trends Using
Estimates from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCJ

City-wide crime rates

Violent crime

The violent crime rate per 1,000 persons age 12 or older ranged
from 60 to 85 across the 12 surveyed cities.

In general the patterns and characteristics of violent crime
found in the 12 cities did not differ greatly from those found
among all urban areas surveyed in the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS)* (Source:  BJS, Criminal
Victimization 1997, NCJ 173385, December 1998.)

The 1997 violent crime rate for all urban areas across the
Nation as measured by NCVS was 51 per 1,000 persons age 12 or
older.

Overall, black residents in the 12 cities experienced violent
victimizations at a rate of 99 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older. 
The violent crime rate for all white residents in the 12 cities was 
61 per 1,000 (table 1).

Property crime

The property crime rate per 1,000 households was 326 for all 12
cities compared to the NCVS urban property crime rate of 310 per
1,000.

In the aggregate, black households in the 12 cities experienced
property crime at a higher rate than white households. In total,
387 per 1,000 black households compared to 311 
per 1,000 white households were victims of property crime.

Among the 12 cities, the difference in property crime
victimization rates between white and black households varied. 
In Los Angeles black households had a property crime
victimization rate of 503 per 1,000 households, compared to 308
per 1,000 white households.

In Washington, DC, whites had a property crime victimization
rate of 513 per 1,000 compared to 383 per 1,000 black households.

Crimes reported to the police

Across all 12 cities, 35% of violent crimes and property crimes
were reported to the police (table 2).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Within most cities the percentage of crimes reported to police
did not differ significantly between violent crime and property
crime.  Similarly across the Nation about a third of the crimes
measured by the NCVS were reported to law enforcement
authorities, according to the victims.

Gender of victim

In general, the rate of violent crime for men age 12 or older
was higher than the rate for women.  Overall in the cities
surveyed, about 93 per 1,000 men and 59 per 1,000 women were
victims of violent crime (table 3).

Using sample data

Since the data in this report came from a sample, a sampling
error (standard error) is associated with each reported number. 
All differences discussed in the text are statistically
significant at or above the 95%-confidence level.  As displayed
in figure 1, the reader is cautioned that some apparent
differences between and among the cities are not statistically
significant.  

All stated differences in the text are tested at the
95%-confidence level.  Standard error tables for selected
estimates are provided in Appendix II.
--------------------------------------------------------

Age of victim

Although persons ages 12-19 in the 12 cities were 12% of the
population surveyed, they were victims of 26% of the violent
crime (not shown in a table). The oldest group, age 50 or older,
made up 29% of the population but suffered 9% of the violent
victimizations.  The remaining age groups, 20-34 and 35-49, both
experienced violent crimes at levels consistent with their
proportion of the population.


Victimization experiences among the different age groups in each
of the 12 cities were similar to that found by NCVS among the
different age groups across the Nation.

Weapon use

The 12-city survey questionnaire asked the victims of violent
crime for information about any weapons used during the incident.

Violent crime victims in the 12 cities said the offender had a
weapon in at least 20% of the incidents -- ranging to  46% in
Savannah (table 4).

not determine whether a weapon was present.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Victim-offender relationship

Victims of violent crime were asked to describe any prior
relationship they may have had with the offender such as being a 
family member, spouse, intimate, nonrelative, or stranger.

Among the total population in the 12 cities surveyed, victims of violent 
crime were more likely to have been victimized by a stranger
than by a nonstranger.  The percentage of violent victimizations
in which the offender was a stranger ranged from 42% in Tucson
to 74% in Los Angeles  (table 5).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the smaller cities (populations below 200,000) the percentage
of violent victimizations committed by a stranger was below the
aggregate level for all 12 cities.

Black victims of violent crimes reported similar percentages of
incidents involving strangers and known offenders.  Overall,
white victims were more often victimized by a stranger (table 6).

Race of offender

Annual findings from the NCVS have indicated that most violent
crimes across the Nation involve victims and offenders of the
same race.  This pattern was also the case in nearly all the 12
cities where data permitted analysis.

Black victims of violent crime committed by a single offender,
most often identified the offender as also being black.  Across
all 12 cities 84% of single-offender incidents committed against
a black victim were committed by a black offender (table 7).

Note:  Violent crimes include rape/sexual assault, robbery, and assault (aggravated and simple).
Zero indicates no cases in the sample.  Table does not include victimizations in which the victim
could not determine the number of offenders or whether the offender(s) was/were stranger(s) or known 
by the victim.
-- Fewer than 10 cases reported in survey.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overall, white victims of violent crime committed by a single
offender most frequently identified whites as their offenders. 
In most of the cities, white victims reported at least half of
the single-offender violent crime incidents were committed by
whites.

Measuring local violent crime

Citizen surveys provide a useful tool to collect crime
victimization data. The 12-city survey was designed to obtain
total violent crime estimates.  The survey used the current
National Criminal Victimization Survey (NCVS) questionnaire with
a series of supplemental questions measuring the residents'
attitudes toward crime, their neighborhood, and local police
activities.  

Another source of crime data is the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR)
based on crimes that are known to the police.  

Each year through the UCR program, the FBI presents crime
statistics for the Nation as a whole as well as for cities.
These data are compiled from monthly law enforcement reports or
individual crime incident records. 

The 12-city local victimization survey collected data for all
victimizations, whether reported to the police or not. The UCR
data are only incidents reported to the police. NCVS data are
collected only from residents age 12 or older; UCR data are for
victims of all ages.

To compare the UCR and NCVS data, only the NCVS incidents that
the respondents said were reported to the police were used.  To
adequately compare NCVS findings with the UCR, common crime
definitions have to be used as well.

Violent crime data from the NCVS  comparable to UCR crimes
include rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.  Because of
differences in methodological procedures, the NCVS and UCR data
are not strictly comparable, but the table does show generally
similar results.  

Overall, the violent crime rate for robbery and aggravated
assault reported in the 12-city survey is similar to that found
in the UCR.  There were some differences in the two reported
crime rates for each city. The UCR violent crime rate was higher
than the city-level survey rate in Chicago and Springfield,
while in Savannah and Madison the UCR rate was lower.

to the police were residential robberies.
b/Complete data were not available for the State of Illinois; therefore it was necessary that their crime 
counts be estimated.
c/Forcible rape figures furnished by the State-level UCR program administered by the Illinois Department
of State Police were not in accordance with national UCR guidelines.  Therefore, the figures were excluded
from the forcible rape category.

Population age 16 or older in 12 cities, by race, 1998

The survey questions on community attitudes were asked only of 
those residents age 16 or older.  City populations differed in
size and racial composition.  The number of residents age 16 or
older varied from about 100,000 to more than 5 million.  The
proportion of the black population in the 12 cities ranged from
2% in Spokane to 53% in Washington, D.C:

category.  Total exceeds 100% due to multiple responses.  Asked only of those residents who said they knew of
serious crimes  which had occurred in their neighborhood in the past 12 months.
Question: "Which of the following types of serious crimes do you know to have occurred in your neighborhood in
the past 12 months -- people openly selling drugs, people openly using drugs, auto theft, theft of personal
property, breaking and entering to steal personal property, violent physical attacks, crimes committed with guns
sexual assault/rape, murder."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About a fifth of all the residents in Chicago, Springfield, and
Washington, D.C. said they were aware of a murder in their
neighborhood. One of the serious crimes which people said they
were least aware of was sexual assault.

Residents in the 12 cities who said they were aware of serious
crimes in their neighborhood were asked how they found out about
these crimes.

In most of the cities residents primarily received information
about serious neighborhood crime either from attending a
community meeting or from the media.  Few residents said they
became aware of serious crime from the police (table 13).

Neighborhood conditions

The 12-city survey asked residents about a series of conditions
and activities which may have existed in their neighborhood. 
Residents said a variety of conditions existed in their
neighborhood (table 15).  These conditions included abandoned
buildings and cars, poor lighting, trash, and empty lots.  At
least a fifth of the residents in each city mentioned "poor
lighting" as a condition which existed in their neighborhood.

Residents were also asked about various activities which may
have been present in their neighborhood.

Question: "Do any of the following conditions or activities exist in your neighborhood  illegal public
drinking/public drug use, public drug sales, vandalism or graffiti, prostitution, panhandling/begging,
loitering/hanging out, truancy/youth skipping school, transients/homeless sleeping on benches, streets?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Residents who identified a neighborhood condition or activity
were asked if any of  these conditions or activities made them
feel less safe in their  neighborhood, and if so, which one
impacted their feeling of safety the most.  

Not all the residents felt that the existence of these specific
conditions or activities affected their perception of public
safety.  For example, between 17% and 36% of all the residents
in each city said the conditions or activities made them feel
less safe (table 17).  Across the cities, public drug use,
loitering and poor lighting were among the conditions that
affected residents' sense of safety  (table 18).

Residents in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Tucson who had
identified a condition frequently said transients and the
homeless sleeping in public were problems that made them feel
less safe (not shown in table).  Few respondents in any of the

Crime prevention measures 
--------------------------

All residents were asked about the types of security measures
they took to protect themselves from crime in their homes as
well as crime which might occur in the street.

The most frequently cited security actions taken by residents in
the 12 cities to protect themselves from crime in their home
included adding outside or automatic lighting, arranging with
neighbors to watch out for each other, and installing extra
locks.  About a third or more of the residents in Knoxville,
Savannah, Spokane, and Tucson kept a weapon inside the home for
self defense.  Less frequently mentioned were installing
security systems, attending neighborhood watch meetings, or
asking police to conduct a home security check (table 25).

Police crime prevention

Sixty percent of respondents from all 12 cities indicated that
in the past 12 months the police had worked at least "somewhat"
with neighborhood residents on crime prevention and safety
(table 37). The percent of residents who identified police
activity regarding crime prevention in the neighborhoods varied
from about 50% of the residents in Knoxville, Spokane, and
Tucson to 68% in Chicago.

related to community policing and citizens' preference for
police activity.

Over half of all respondents said they were familiar with the
term "community policing" (table 38).  In Chicago, 73% of the
residents were familiar with community policing.

*Including those residents who said police practiced community policing "somewhat."
Question:  "Community policing involves police officers working with the community 
to address the causes of crime in an effort to reduce the problems and the associated 
fear, through a wide range of activities.  Based on the definition, do you think the
police in your neighborhood practice community policing?"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Residents who reported community policing activities in their
neighborhoods became aware of those activities in different
ways.  Overall, about a third of the residents said they became
aware of community policing in their neighborhood because they
saw the police doing community policing activities (20%) or they
heard about it in the media (12%) (table 40). The remaining
residents stated several other ways of learning about such
activities, including talking with neighbors and children,
neighborhood meetings and newsletters, advertising in the
community, and police patrols.

Methodology
-------------

The methodological description of the study is based on the
material presented in the Census Bureau's NCVS Research
Memorandum No. 98-02 -- Community-Oriented Policing Services:
Project Description and Analysis Plan -- Revised by Denise Lewis
and Elaine Hock, May 1, 1998.

This survey was designed to obtain total violent crime estimates
in 12 selected cities.  The survey used the current National
Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) questionnaire with a series of
supplemental questions measuring the attitudes in each city. 
The NCVS collects data in interviews from all household members
age 12 or older about victimizations that occurred within the
preceding 6 months. For the purposes of the 12-city survey,
respondents were asked about incidents that occurred within the
last year. Information on any of the following crimes is
collected:

* Violent crimes of rape, robbery, aggravated assault, and
simple assault
* Personal crimes of theft 
* Household crimes of burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft.

The data collection was done using Computer Assisted Telephone
Interviewing (CATI). The data collection took place over a
4-month period starting in February 1998.

---------------
Sample design
---------------

The 12-city survey sample design is a simple random sample of
telephone numbers within each city.  People residing within the
city boundaries of interest were the target population. The
Demographic Statistical Methods Division (DSMD) used the GENESYS
Random-Digit Dialing (RDD) Sampling System to select zip codes
associated with each of the 12 cities. The GENESYS RDD Sampling
System selects telephone numbers at a unit called a cell.  These
cells are grouped  to form projects. For the 12-city survey, a
cell contained the appropriate zip codes for each sample city,
and the project was the sample city itself.

GENESYS numbers are contained in banks which are sets of 100
potential telephone numbers.  These numbers have the same area
code and five-digit prefix. Only those banks that contained at
least one listed telephone number were used.  By excluding banks
that contained only unlisted numbers, a slight coverage bias was
incurred. 

After obtaining GENESYS banks of phone numbers for zip codes
within the 12 cities, DSMD obtained zip code maps that showed
county and city boundaries. The zip codes that were wholly
within city boundaries were included in the sample. In the zip
codes that crossed boundaries, DSMD looked at population counts
to determine which zip codes to include. Cut-off levels for
inclusion of zip codes were determined on a city-by-city basis.
The cut-offs used included as much city population as possible
while minimizing the population outside the city.

Approximately 870 household interviews, or 1,600 individual
interviews, were required within each city to obtain total crime
estimates at the 10% coefficient of variation level.

Prior NCVS results suggested that there were an estimated 1.84
eligible persons per household.  This number was applied to the
estimated number of household interviews to obtain the 1,600
individual interviews within each city. Applying these estimates
for all 12 cities produced a required total sample size of
10,440 household cases.  Exact household counts varied across
cities based on differences in the percent of the city
population age 12 or older. Target household interview counts
were --

   Total           10,449

Tucson, AZ            878    
Springfield, MA       894
Los Angeles, CA       881          
New York, NY          866

San Diego, CA         868          
Knoxville, TN         844
Savannah, GA          891          
Spokane, WA           875

Chicago, IL           885         
Madison, WI           840
Kansas City, MO       884       
Washington, DC        843

The target household sample sizes were then increased by four
types of inflation factors: geographic screenouts,
nonrespondents, ineligible respondents, and nonresidential
respondents. Based on previous studies of this type it was
estimated that approximately 40,000 telephone numbers would need
to be screened to obtain the required number of interviews.

The monthly designated sample size for the first month was based
on the Telephone Point of Purchase Survey (TPOPS) interview and
screenout rates. DSMD provided phone numbers for additional
households in the first month to ensure that the final sample
size was achieved. This was done to allow for additional
sampling in the following months if the expected number of
interviews was not attained.

Survey interview and screen-out rates replaced TPOPS rates as
the survey progressed.  This allowed more accurate projections
of interview counts.  The designated sample sizes were adjusted
among the cities in April and May to take into account inflation
that differed across the 12 cities.  Telephone numbers were
edited to eliminate numbers already in a prior month's sample. 
Listed business numbers were eliminated from the sample using
the GENESYS Sampling System.

-----------------------------
Nonsampling sources of error
-----------------------------

In addition to sampling error, other sources of error can affect
the data collected. These sources include:

* The inability to obtain information about all cases in the
sample. To reach the established target sample size of
approximately 800 households per city almost twice that number
of households had to be contacted by telephone.  If respondents
in fact differ from nonrespondents, this could be a source of
significant bias in the estimates.

* Data collection errors resulting from recording and coding
data and errors in estimating values for missing data

* Failure to represent all city-wide household units with the
selected sample (undercoverage).  This survey excluded the
nontelephone households and households with unlisted phone
numbers in strictly unlisted phone banks.  Although there is
evidence that nontelephone households have somewhat different
victimization rates than other households, the size of these
groups is small enough that the effect on overall rates would
not be large.

* Respondent recall error and the unboundedness of the
interview.  In the regular NCVS, interviews are bounded, as
households are interviewed more than once to exclude incidents
outside the time reference period.  This was not possible in the
12-city RDD survey.

Weighting/estimation procedures
--------------------------------

Each person, household, and person incident received a full
sample final weight. The final weight was the product of all the
components presented in the table on this page. 
The weighting was done independently within each of the 12
cities.

The weights calculated for each person, household, and person
incident contain the following four components:
* Base weight is the inverse of the probability of selecting the
household's telephone number.
* Multiple phone number factor adjusts for households with more
than one telephone number and therefore a higher probability of
selection.
* Household noninterview adjustment factor adjusts for household
noninterviews. This includes both in scope noninterviews and a
portion of the cases with unknown eligibility. Fifty percent of
the unknown eligibility cases were assumed to be in-scope
noninterviews.

Multiple-victim adjustment factor                      X

* Population ratio estimate factor  adjusts the weighted person
totals to the estimated city population for each of the surveyed
cities. DSMD determined the growth rate for each city based on
April 1, 1990, and July 1, 1996 city population counts.  These
growth rates were then applied to the July 1996 counts to
estimate city populations for February 1998. Further adjustments
were made to reflect each city's population age 12 older,
(eligible to take part in this survey).


The person and person incident weights also included the
Within-Household Noninterview Factor (WHNF). The WHNF inflates
the weights of interviewed persons within interviewed households
to account for noninterviewed persons within interviewed
households. The weight assigned for the household is the weight
of the principal person excluding the WHNF; this weight is also
used to construct household incident estimates.

The incident weight also includes the Multiple-Victim Adjustment
Factor (MVAF). This factor reduces the weights of multiple
persons involved in a single victimization.

-------------------------------------------
Replicate weighting and variance estimation
-------------------------------------------

The sample used for a survey is one of a large number of
possible samples of equal size that could have been obtained
using the same sample design and selection procedures.
Information collected from the sample surveyed is used to
estimate characteristics of the entire population. The accuracy
of those estimates must be measured to determine whether
apparent differences are significant or part of the estimates'
variation.

The standard error of a survey estimate is a measure of the
variation among that estimate from all possible samples. DSMD
has traditionally developed generalized variance functions that
modeled the standard error for each type of characteristic
studied. Generalized variance functions derive standard errors
which are applicable to a wide variety of items and which can be
prepared at a moderate cost, but require a number of approximations.

For the 12-city survey, variance estimation is based on the
concept of replication. Through the use of replicate weights,
users can compute standard errors for any characteristic that is
relevant to their area of interest.  The standard errors are
more accurate than with the previously used approximations obtained 
through generalized variance functions.

Replicate samples were created by randomly assigning a replicate
code (1 to R) within each primary sampling unit (PSU). For the
12-city survey, a replicate code of r=1, ..., 30 was assigned to
each sample case at the time of sampling. This created thirty
replicate samples (R), each containing 1/30 of the sample.

Replicate methods of variance estimation require reweighted
replicate samples.  The 12 cities replicate samples were
reweighted by rerunning the basic weighting program 30 times
with the following revisions:
* excluded one replicate sample for each iteration of the
weighting procedure.
* increased the base weight of each replicate sample by a factor
of 30/(30-1) to account for the exclusion of one replicate
sample during each iteration.

The survey data can now be used to calculate estimators for each
characteristic of interest and each estimator variance. The
appropriate replication method to calculate variances is the
"simple jackknife" because the 12-city survey used a simple
random sample. The simple jackknife procedure requires that
replicate codes (1 to R) be randomly assigned to each case,
which was done during sampling. To calculate an estimator and
its variance, first calculate the estimator of interest using
the complete sample. Then recalculate the estimator for each of
the 30 reweighted replicate samples.  The simple jackknife
variance estimator is:

     where:

R = the total number of reweighted replicate samples

y/r = the reweighted replicate sample estimator

y = the complete sample estimator

Use of replicate weights to calculate variances requires a vast
number of computations.  Software programs have been developed to
perform these procedures.

Survey Instrument
---------------------------

The survey questions related to community attitudes were
developed through a collaboration between the Office of
Community Oriented Policing Services and the Bureau of Justice
Statistics.  

A number of survey instruments were reviewed during the
development of the community policing questions.  Specific
questions were adapted from policing surveys conducted in --

Chicago, Illinois,
Knoxville, Tennessee,
Pocatello, Idaho, and
Tempe, Arizona.

Comments on the survey instrument were provided by Gary Cordner
of Eastern Kentucky University, Wes Skogan of Northwestern University, 
and Deborah Weisel of the Police Executive Research Forum.  

The Bureau of the Census reviewed the final instrument prior to
field work.
