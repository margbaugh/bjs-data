---------------------------------------------------         

Twelve States executed 59 prisoners during 
2004. The number executed was 6 fewer than 
in 2003. Those executed during 2004 had been 
under sentence of death an average of 11 
years, or 1 month longer than the period for 
inmates executed in 2003.

At yearend 2004, 3,314 prisoners were under
sentence of death. California held the largest
number on death row (637), followed by Texas
(446), Florida (364), and Pennsylvania (222).
Thirty-three people were under a Federal death
sentence.

During 2004, 29 States and the Federal prison
system received 125 prisoners under sentence 
of death. Texas (23 admissions), California 
(11), the Federal prison system (10), Florida 
(9), Alabama (7), and Louisiana (6) accounted 
for more than half of those sentenced in 2004 
(53%).

In 2004, 59 men were executed, including 36
whites, 19 blacks, 3 Hispanics (all white), 
and 1 Asian. Fifty-eight were carried out by 
lethal injection; one by electrocution.

From January 1, 1977, to December 31, 2004, 
944 inmates were executed by 32 States and the
Federal Bureau of Prisons. Two-thirds of the
executions occurred in 5 States: Texas (336),
Virginia (94), Oklahoma (75), Missouri (61), 
and Florida (59).

Capital punishment laws

At yearend 2004 the death penalty was authorized
by 38 States and the Federal Government. No
State enacted new legislation authorizing capital
punishment in 2004.

The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled on February
3, 2004, that aggravating factors are elements 
of a capital murder under State statute and must,
therefore, be submitted to the grand jury and
returned in an indictment(State v. Fort in, 843 
A.2d 974 (2004)).  

The New York Court of Appeals overturned a
portion of that State's criminal procedure on 
June 24, 2004.  The decision in People v. 
LaValle (3 NY3d 88, 783 NYS2d 485 (Ct of Apps. 
2004)) found that the requirement that jurors 
in the penalty phase of a capital trial be told 
that a deadlock will allow the defendant to be 
eligible for parole violated the heightened 
standard of reliability in sentencing required 
by the New York State Constitution.

The Kansas Supreme Court struck a portion of
that State's capital statute on December 17, 
2004 (State v. Michael Lee Marsh II, Case No. 
81, 135). The statute states that when the 
existence of aggravating circumstances is not 
outweighed by any mitigating circumstances a 
death sentence should be imposed (K.S.A. 
21-4624(e)). The court ruled that this was 
unconstitutional under the Eighth and 
Fourteenth Amendments.

Statutory changes

During 2004, 4 States revised statutory 
provisions relating to the death penalty. 
By State, the changes were as follows:

California -- Added to its penal code a 
new section which defines mentally retarded 
and procedures for determining whether a 
defendant is mentally retarded (Cal. Penal 
Code, Section 1376). The statute exempts 
imposition of a death sentence on any 
defendant found to be mentally retarded and 
became effective January 1, 2004.
 
South Dakota -- Enacted a law creating a
minimum age of 18 for which a death sentence
may be imposed (SDCL 23A-27A-42), effective
July 1, 2004.

Utah -- Repealed the use of a firing squad 
as a method of execution for all persons 
sentenced to death on or after May 3, 2004 
(Utah Code Ann. sec77-18-5.5). The law 
allows for use of a firing squad for those 
sentenced prior to that date or in the 
event that lethal injection is found to be 
unconstitutional.

Wyoming -- Revised the capital statute to 
increase the minimum age of eligibility for 
a death sentence from 16 to 18 years at the 
time the murder was committed (W.S. 6-2-101
(b)), effective 7/1/2004.

Automatic review

Of the 38 States with capital statutes at 
yearend, 37 provided for review of all death 
sentences regardless of the defendant's 
wishes. In South Carolina the defendant had 
the right to waive sentence review if he or 
she was deemed competent by the court(State 
v. Torrence, 473 S.E. 3d 703 (S.C. 1996)). 
Federal death penalty procedures did not 
provide for automatic review after a 
sentence of death had been imposed.

The State's highest appellate court usually
conducted the review. If either the conviction 
or sentence was vacated, the case could be
remanded to the trial court for additional
proceedings or retrial. As a result of retrial 
or resentencing, a death sentence could be
reimposed.

While most of the 37 States authorized 
automatic review of both the conviction and 
sentence, Idaho, Montana, Oklahoma, South 
Dakota, and Tennessee required review of the 
sentence only. In Idaho review of the 
conviction had to be filed through appeal or 
forfeited. In Indiana and Kentucky a defendant 
could waive review of the conviction.

In Virginia a defendant could waive an appeal 
of trial court error but could not waive 
review of the death sentence for arbitrariness 
and proportionality. 

In Mississippi the question of whether the
defendant could waive the right to automatic
review had not been addressed. In Wyoming
neither statute nor case law precluded a 
waiver of appeal. 

Arkansas implemented a rule requiring review 
of specific issues relating to both capital 
convictions and sentences (Ark. R. App. P. -- 
Crim 10). Recent case law held waivers of this 
review are not permitted (Newman v. State, No. 
CR02-811, 2002Westlaw 31030906 (Ark. Sept.
12, 2002)). 

Method of execution

As of December 31, 2004, lethal injection
was the predominant method of execution 
(37 States).

Nine States authorized electrocution; four 
States, lethal gas; three States, hanging; 
and three States, firing squad.

Seventeen States authorized more than 1 method
-- lethal injection and an alternative method --
generally at the election of the condemned
prisoner; however, 5 of these 17 stipulated 
which method must be used depending on the date 
of sentencing; 1 authorized hanging only if 
lethal injection could not be given; and if 
lethal injection is ever ruled to be 
unconstitutional, 1 authorized lethal gas, 
1 authorized electrocution or firing squad, 
and 1 authorized firing squad.

The method of execution of Federal prisoners 
is lethal injection, pursuant to 28 CFR, Part 
26. For offenses under the Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the 
method is that of the State in which the 
conviction took place (18 U.S.C. 3596).

Minimum age

In 2004 six jurisdictions did not specify a 
minimum age for which the death penalty 
could be imposed.
  
In some States the minimum age was set forth in
the statutory provisions that determine the age 
at which a juvenile may be transferred to adult 
court for trial as an adult. Eighteen States 
and the Federal system required a minimum age 
of 18. Fourteen States indicated an age of 
eligibility between 14 and 17.

Characteristics of prisoners under sentence 
of death at yearend 2004

Thirty-six States and the Federal prison system
held a total of 3,314 prisoners under sentence 
of death on December 31, 2004, a decrease of 
63 since the end of 2003. This was the fourth
consecutive year that the number of prisoners
under a sentence of death declined, down from
3,601 on December 31, 2000.
       
Three States reported 44% of the Nation's death
row population: California (637), Texas (446), 
and Florida (364). The Federal Bureau of 
Prisons held 33 inmates at yearend. Of the 39 
jurisdictions authorizing the death penalty 
during 2004, New Hampshire and Kansas had no 
one under a capital sentence, and New York, 
South Dakota, Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, 
and Wyoming had 4 or fewer.

Among the 37 jurisdictions with prisoners under
sentence of death at yearend 2004, 9 had more
inmates than a year earlier, 15 had fewer 
inmates, and 13 had the same number. The largest
increase occurred in the Federal Bureau of
Prisons (10), followed by California (7), 
Illinois (4), and Oregon (2). The largest 
decreases were in Arizona (19), North Carolina 
(13), and Oklahoma (10).

During 2004 the number of white and black inmates 
under sentence of death declined (by 32 and 27, 
respectively). The number of persons of other 
races (including American Indians, Asians, and 
self-identified Hispanics) decreased from 78
to 74.

Men made up 98% (3,262) of all prisoners under
sentence of death. Whites accounted for 56%;
blacks accounted for 42%; and other races (2%)
included 28 American Indians, 32 Asians, and 
14 persons whose race was unknown. Among 
those for whom ethnicity was known, 13% were
Hispanic.

During 2004 the number of women sentenced to
be executed increased from 47 to 52. Five 
women were received under sentence of death; 
none was removed from death row. Women were 
under sentence of death in 19 States. More 
than 6 in 10 women on death row at yearend 
were being held in four States: California, 
Texas, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina.

The number of Hispanics under sentence of 
death rose from 365 to 367 during 2004. 
Sixteen Hispanics were received under 
sentence of death, 11 were removed from 
death row, and 3 were executed. More than 
three-quarters of the Hispanics were held 
in 3 States: California (131), Texas (124), 
and Florida (31).

The gender, race, and Hispanic origin of 
those under sentence of death at yearend 
2004 were as follows:

Among all inmates under sentence of death for
whom date of arrest was available, about half 
were age 20 to 29 at the time of arrest for 
their capital offense; 13% were age 19 or 
younger; and less than 1% were age 55 or older. 
The average age at time of arrest was 28 years.

On December 31, 2004, 34% of all inmates were
age 30 to 39, and 63% were age 25 to 44. The
youngest offender under sentence of death 
was 18; the oldest was 89.

Criminal history of inmates under 
sentence of death in 2004

Among inmates under a death sentence on
December 31, 2004, for whom criminal history
information was available, 64% had prior 
felony convictions, including 8% with at 
least one previous homicide conviction.

Among those for whom legal status at the time 
of the capital offense was available, 40% had 
an active criminal justice status. Less than 
half of these were on parole and a quarter 
were on probation. The remaining third had 
charges pending, were incarcerated, had 
escaped from incarceration, or had some other 
criminal justice
status.

Criminal history patterns differed by race and
Hispanic origin. More blacks (70%) than whites
(62%) or Hispanics (59%) had a prior felony
conviction. About the same percentage of whites,
blacks, and Hispanics had a prior homicide
conviction (8%). A slightly higher percentage 
of Hispanics (22%) or blacks (17%) than whites
(14%) were on parole when arrested for their
capital offense.

Since 1988 data have been collected on the
number of death sentences imposed on entering
inmates. Among the 4,283 individuals received
under sentence of death during that time, 1
in 7 entered with 2 or more death sentences.

Entries and removals of persons under
sentence of death

Between January 1 and December 31, 2004, 29
State prison systems and the Federal Bureau of
Prisons reported receiving 125 inmates under
sentence of death. More than half of the 
inmates were received in 6 jurisdictions: Texas 
(23), California (11), the Federal system (10), 
Florida (9), Alabama (7) and Louisiana (6).

All 125 prisoners who were received under
sentence of death had been convicted of murder;
5 were female. By race, 75 were white and 50
were black. Of the 125 new admissions, 16 were
Hispanic.

The 125 admissions to death row in 2004 marked
a decline of 27 from the 152 admissions recorded
in 2003, and represented the smallest number
received in a year since 44 persons were admitted
in 1973. The 10 persons who entered the Federal
prison system in 2004 was twice the previous
largest number of annual admissions to the
Federal system since 1973 (5 in 1993 and in
2002).

Twenty-two States reported 107 persons whose
death sentences were removed or overturned.
Appeals courts vacated 72 sentences while
upholding the convictions and vacated 25
sentences while overturning the convictions.
Arizona (23 exits) had the largest number of
vacated sentences. Four States reported 4
commutations of a death sentence, including
Indiana, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Texas (one
each). Six inmates had their death sentence
declared unconstitutional by the Kansas 
Supreme Court.

As of December 31, 2004, 57 of 107 persons who 
were formerly under sentence of death were
serving a reduced sentence, 20 were awaiting a
new trial, 23 were awaiting resentencing, 1 
had all capital charges dropped, and 6 had 
no action taken after being removed from 
under sentence of death.

In addition, 22 persons died while under sentence
of death in 2004. Nineteen of these deaths were
from natural causes -- 4 each in Ohio and
California; 3 in Florida; 2 in Texas ; and 1 
each in Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, North 
Carolina, Oklahoma, and Idaho. Three deaths 
were suicides -- one each in Texas, Virginia, 
and Montana.

From 1977, the year after the Supreme Court
upheld the constitutionality of revised State 
capital punishment laws, to 2004, a total of 
6,807 persons entered prison under sentence of 
death. During these 28 years, 944 persons were 
executed, and 2,929 were removed from under a 
death sentence by appellate court decisions and 
reviews, commutations, or death.***Footnote 1: 
An individual may have been received and removed
from under sentence of death more than once. 
Data are based on the most recent sentence.***

Among individuals who received a death sentence
between 1977 and 2004, 3,331 (49%) were white,
2,773 (41%) were black, 593 (9%) were Hispanic,
and 110 (2%) were other races. The distribution 
by race and Hispanic origin of the 3,873 inmates 
who were removed from death row between 1977 and
2004 was as follows: 2,002 whites (52%), 1,576
blacks (41%), 241 Hispanics (6%), and 54 persons
of other races (1%). Of the 944 who were
executed, 546(58%)were white, 320 (34%) were
black, 64(7%) were Hispanic, and 14 (1%)were 
of other races.

Executions

According to data collected by the Federal
Government, from 1930 to 2004, 4,803 persons
were executed under civil authority.
***Footnote 2: Military authorities carried 
out an additional 160 executions between 1930 
and 1961.*** 

After the Supreme Court reinstated the death
penalty in 1976, 32 States and the Federal
Government executed 944 prisoners:

During this 28-year period, 5 States executed 
625 prisoners: Texas (336), Virginia (94), 
Oklahoma (75), Missouri (61), and Florida (59). 
These States accounted for two-thirds of all 
executions. Between 1977 and 2004, 537 white 
non-Hispanic men, 319 black non-Hispanic men, 
64 Hispanic men, 8 American Indian men, 6 
Asian men, 9 white non-Hispanic women, and 1 
black non-Hispanic woman were executed.

During 2004 Texas carried out 23 executions;
Ohio executed 7 persons; Oklahoma, 6 persons;
Virginia, 5; North Carolina and South Carolina, 
4 each; Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Nevada, 
2 each; and Arkansas and Maryland, 1 each. All 
59 of the inmates executed in 2004 were male.
Thirty-six were white; 19 were black; 3 were
Hispanic; and 1 was Asian.

From 1977 to 2004, 7,187 prisoners were under
death sentences for varying lengths of time. 
The 944 executions accounted for 13% of those 
at risk. A total of 2,929 prisoners (41% of 
those at risk) were removed by means other 
than execution. A higher percentage of whites 
(16%) were executed as compared with both blacks 
(11%) and Hispanics (11%). Somewhat larger 
percentages of blacks (43%) and whites (41%) 
than Hispanics (29%) were removed from under a 
death sentence by means other than execution.

Among prisoners executed from 1977 to 2004, the
average time between the imposition of the most
recent sentence received and execution was more
than 10 years. White prisoners had spent an
average of 10 years and 1 month, and black
prisoners, 10 years and 9 months. The 59
prisoners executed in 2004 were under sentence 
of death an average of 11 years.

For the 944 prisoners executed between 1977 
and 2004, the most common method of execution 
was lethal injection (776). Other methods used
included electrocution (152), lethal gas (11),
hanging (3), and firing squad (2).

Among prisoners under sentence of death at
yearend 2004, the average time spent in prison
was 10 years and 2 months, up 7 months from 
that in 2003. The median time between the 
imposition of a death sentence and yearend 
2004 was 9 years and 2 months.

Overall, the average time for women was 7 years
and 11 months, 27 months less than that for men
(10 years and 2 months). On average, whites,
blacks, and Hispanics had spent from 105 to 
126 months under a sentence of death.

----------------------------------------------
Advance count of executions: January 1, 2005
-- September 28, 2005

To provide the latest data on capital punishment,
BJS gathers information following each execution.
The data include the date of execution, the
jurisdiction, method used, and the name, race, 
and gender of each person executed.

As of September 28, 2005, 12 States had
executed 41 inmates, 3 fewer than the number
executed as of the same day in 2004.

Five States accounted for nearly three-quarters 
of the executions carried out during this 
period: Texas performed 13; Indiana executed 
5; and Missouri, Alabama, and Oklahoma each 
carried out 4.

Connecticut executed one inmate, the first in 
that State since 1960.

Lethal injection accounted for all 41 
executions.

Thirty of those executed were white and 11 
were black. One woman was executed (Texas). 

Final counts for 2005 will appear in Capital
Punishment 2005, released in late 2006. This
annual report will consist of data collected 
from State and Federal correctional agencies.  
The report will cover all persons under 
sentence of death on December 31, 2005, as 
well as those removed from under sentence of 
death.
--------------------------------------------          

Methodology

Capital punishment information is collected
annually as part of the National Prisoner 
Statistics program (NPS-8). This data series 
is collected in two parts: data on persons 
under sentence of death are obtained from the 
department of corrections in each jurisdiction 
currently authorizing capital punishment; and 
information on the status of death penalty 
statutes is obtained from the Office of the 
Attorney General in each of the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, and the Federal Government. 
Data collection forms and more detailed tables 
are available on the BJS website <www.ojp.usdoj.

NPS-8 covers all persons under sentence of death
at any time during the year who were held in a
State or Federal nonmilitary correctional 
facility. Included are capital offenders 
transferred from prison to mental hospitals and 
those who may have escaped from custody. 
Excluded are persons whose death sentences have 
been overturned by the court, regardless of their 
current incarceration status.

The statistics reported in this Bulletin may 
differ from data collected by other organizations 
for a variety of reasons: (1) NPS-8 adds inmates 
to the population under sentence of death not at
sentencing but at the time they are admitted to a
State or Federal correctional facility; (2) If 
inmates entered prison under a death sentence or 
were reported as being relieved of a death 
sentence in one year but the court had acted 
in the previous year, the counts are adjusted 
to reflect the dates of court decisions(see 
the note on table 4 for the affected 
jurisdictions); and (3)NPS counts are always 
for the last day of the calendar year and will 
differ from counts for more recent periods.

All data in this report have been reviewed for
accuracy by the data providers in each 
jurisdiction prior to publication.
