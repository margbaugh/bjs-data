----------------------------------------------------
            
In 2001 State court prosecutors' offices
that served districts with a population of
500,000 or more budgeted over $2.9
billion for prosecutorial functions. Results
from the 2001 National Survey of Prosecutors 
(NSP) indicate that these 114 offices in 
large districts closed more than 1 million 
felony cases and employed over 40,000 staff 
during the year.  The median office budget 
for prosecution was $14 million, and the 
median total staff size was 234.  

The survey found that most offices in
large districts had experience prosecuting
computer-related crime (83%) and had
implemented community prosecution by
involving the community to help identify
crime and other problem areas (81%).  All
the large district offices had used DNA
evidence during felony trials, and all had
prosecuted domestic violence and child
abuse felony offenses in 2001.

The 2001 NSP collected data on all chief
prosecutors that handled felony cases 
in State courts of general jurisdiction.
***Footnote 1: The 1990, 1992, 1994, and
1996 NSP data collections surveyed a 
nationally representative sample of chief
prosecutors that tried felony cases in
State courts of general jurisdiction.***
The survey did not include municipal 
attorneys or county attorneys who primarily 
operate in courts of limited jurisdiction. 
This report focuses entirely on the 114 
prosecutors' offices that served districts 
with a population of 500,000 or more.
***Footnote 2: A report on all 2,341 State 
court prosecutors' offices is scheduled for 
spring 2002.*** 

In 2001, 114 prosecutors' offices out of
the 2,341 offices nationwide served
districts with a population of 500,000 or
more.  Although these 114 offices comprised 
only 5% of all prosecutors' offices nationwide, 
they served 45% of the U.S. population in 
1999.  About two-thirds of Part I Uniform 
Crime Report (UCR) offenses reported to the 
police in 1998 occurred in the prosecutorial 
districts served by these offices.
***Footnote 3: Part I Uniform Crime Report 
offenses taken from Uniform Crime Reporting 
Program Data: County-Level Detailed Arrest 
and offense Data, 1998, Part 4, Crimes 
Reported (computer file).*** 

Half of these offices represented a district
with a population of 772,000 or more.  The
majority (83%) of prosecutors' offices in 
large districts served one county.  Three 
of the offices, in which the Attorney General 
had responsibility for prosecuting all 
violations of state law, had jurisdiction 
for their entire State (Alaska, Delaware, and 
Rhode Island).
                                       
While all the offices in this report 
served at least 500,000 or more residents, 
the size of the prosecutorial district 
varied considerably among the 114 offices.  
For example, the largest prosecutor's office,
Los Angeles County, California served a
population of over 9 million, while the
prosecutor's office in Camden County,
New Jersey, served a population slightly
over 500,000.  Since staffing, budget, and
workload often differ according to the size
of the prosecutorial district, this report
presents information in the aggregate for
all 114 offices and then by categories for
offices that served a district with a
population of 1 million or more and offices
that served between 500,000 to 999,999. 

The offices that served 1 million or more
residents were generally different from 
the other offices examined in this report. 
Prosecutors' offices serving 1 million or
more had considerably more staff and
larger budgets and caseloads.  For example, 
for districts  of 1 million or more, the 
per resident amount budgeted was $28 compared 
to $18 per resident of districts between 
500,000 and 999,999. In prosecutors' offices 
serving 1 million or more, the number of 
assistant prosecutors per 100,000 residents 
was 12.3, compared to 10.5 for offices 
serving between 500,000 and 999,999.

Staffing in large districts

In 2001 prosecutors' offices in large 
districts employed more than 40,000 staff
including assistant prosecutors, paralegals, 
victim advocates, investigators, and support 
staff.  About 4% of the total staff worked 
part time.  Attorneys (assistant prosecutors, 
civil attorneys, and supervisory attorneys)
responsible for felony prosecutions or civil
litigation comprised about 38% of total
staff.  Support staff, including
administrative staff and clerical staff,
comprised about 36% of total staff. 

The median total staff size for large district 
prosecutors' offices was 234, including the 
chief prosecutor.  Half of the offices reported 
79 or more assistant prosecutors and 8 or 
more supervisory attorneys.  The median 
number of support staff was 69 and of staff 
investigators was 17. Overall, the ratio of 
assistant prosecutors (including supervisory 
attorneys) to investigators was 3.6 attorneys 
to 1 investigator;  to victim advocates, 9.7 
to 1; and to support staff members, 1 to 1. 

Term of office, length of service, 
and salary of chief prosecutor in 
large districts

During 2001 all 114 prosecutors' offices in
large districts reported employing a full-
time chief prosecutor.  Most large district 
chief prosecutors were elected or appointed 
to 4-year terms (88%), with half serving 8 
years or more (not shown in a table).  

About 25% of chief prosecutors in large
districts had served 15 years or more. In
general, chief prosecutors representing
districts with a population between
500,000 to 999,999 served longer in office
(median of 8.3 years) than their counterparts 
representing districts with 1 million or 
more (median of 6.5 years). 

Half of prosecutors' offices in large
districts reported that the chief prose-
cutor earned $125,000 or more per year 
(not shown in a table).  The chief prosecutor
earned an annual salary of $100,000 or
more in 86% of the offices.  The annual
salary for chief prosecutors in large
districts ranged from $84,000 to $190,000.

Attorney recruitment and retention 
in large districts

Problems with recruiting new staff
attorneys were reported by 58% of large
district prosecutors' offices.  Eighty-
one percent of prosecutors' offices with
recruitment problems indicated that the
primary obstacle was noncompetitive
salaries (not shown in a table).

Problems with recruiting new staff
attorneys was cited more often in offices
serving districts with a population between
500,000 to 999,999 (64%) than offices
serving districts with a population of 1
million or more (46%).  Retaining staff
attorneys also was a problem for most
prosecutors' offices in large districts
(72%).  Three-fourths of the offices with
retention problems reported that the
amount of the salary was the primary
obstacle (not shown in a table). 

Annual salary for full-time assistant
prosecutors and supervisory attorneys
in large districts
                                   
In 2001 the median minimum annual salary 
for entry level assistant prosecutors
in offices in large districts was $40,000,
and the median maximum annual salary
was $51,100.  For assistant prosecutors
with 5 years of experience, the median
minimum salary was $54,000 and for
supervisory attorneys the median minimum 
salary was $70,000.  Half of the offices 
reported that the maximum annual salary 
for assistant prosecutors with 5 years of 
experience was $68,576 or more and for 
supervisory attorneys $104,260 or more.  
In general, the median minimum and maximum 
salaries for assistant prosecutors and 
supervisory attorneys were higher in offices 
serving districts with a population of 1 
million or more.      

Budget of prosecutors' offices in 
large districts
                    
In 2001 prosecutors' offices in large
districts had total budgets of over $2.9
billion for prosecutorial functions.  
Half of the offices reported an annual 
budget of $14 million or more.  The budget 
for large district prosecutors' offices 
ranged from $1.4 million to $373 million.  
The median annual budget for offices 
serving a district with population of 1 
million or more ($32 million) was almost 
3 times the median annual budget for offices 
serving a district with a population between 
500,000 to 999,999 ($11 million) .

Most of the offices indicated that staff
salaries (99%), expert services (90%),
and investigator services (90%) were
included in their reported budget amounts.
Three-fourths of large district offices
reported that funds for interpreter 
services and for DNA testing were included. 
Funding for social services (38%) and
child support enforcement (31%) were
included by about a third of prosecutors'
offices in large districts.

Half of the prosecutors' offices in large
districts received 70% or more of their
funding from the county government (not
shown in a table).  Forty-one percent of
the offices did not receive State
government funds and 17% did not receive 
county government funds.  About 11% of 
the offices reported receiving some portion 
of their budget from the city government.  
Some amount of grant funds were received 
by 85% of the offices in large districts.  

Types of cases handled by 
prosecutors' offices in large 
districts 

Large district offices prosecuted a wide
variety of felony offenses.  In addition 
to felony criminal cases, 93% of prosecutors'
offices in large districts also had
jurisdiction for juvenile matters, 87%
misdemeanor cases, 84% misdemeanor
appeals, 64% felony appeals, 59% traffic
violations, 46% child support enforcement,
and 34% represented the government in
civil lawsuits.  Felony and misdemeanor
appeals were handled more often in offices 
serving a district with population of
1 million or more (77%, 97%) than in
offices serving a district with population
between 500,000 to 999,999 (58%, 77%). 

Special categories of felony 
offenses prosecuted in large 
districts 

All large district prosecutors' offices
reported they had prosecuted domestic
violence and child abuse felony offenses
during the previous year. Over 90% of
offices indicated prosecuting illegal
possession of a firearm (93%) and stalking 
(91%) offenses.  Offenses related to health 
care fraud were prosecuted in 42% of the 
offices and telemarketing fraud in 36%.  
About 46% of prosecutors' offices in large 
districts also indicated that they prose-
cute use of excessive force offenses by 
the police.
 
Offices serving a district with 1 million 
or more were more likely than those offices
serving between 500,000 to 999,999 to have 
prosecuted police use of excessive force 
(65%) health care fraud (56%) and 
telemarketing fraud (50%) offenses.

Computer related crime prosecuted 
in large districts

Over the previous year, 83% of large
district offices reported prosecuting
computer related crimes under their
State's computer statutes.  Three-fourths
of the offices indicated prosecuting
misdemeanor or felony computer related
crimes dealing with the transmittal of 
child pornography (75%) or credit card 
fraud (73%).  Two-thirds of offices 
prosecuted identity theft (68%), 
cyberstalking (66%), and bank card fraud 
(66%) computer crimes.  Computer sabotage 
(29%), unauthorized copying or distribution 
of computer programs (25%), and theft of
intellectual property (24%) computer crimes 
were prosecuted in about a quarter of the 
offices. 
 
Number of cases and convictions 
in large districts

During the 12 months before the survey,
prosecutors' offices in large districts
closed more than 1 million felony cases
and 3 million misdemeanor cases. 
Approximately 823 felony cases were
closed per 100,000 large district 
residents. The median number of felony 
jury trials per office was 160.  Half 
of large district offices closed 6,347 
or more felony cases. About 72 felony 
cases per assistant prosecutor were 
closed.***Footnote 4: This estimate was
calculated by dividing the total number
of felony cases closed divided by the
number of assistant prosecutors including
supervisory attorneys.  An assumption
made in calculating the estimate is that
all large district assistant prosecutors
handled felony cases, which may not 
always be the case.*** 

In at least half of the offices, 85% or 
more of felony cases resulted in a felony 
or misdemeanor conviction.  The median
number of felony jury trial verdicts per
office was 160.  Half of the offices serving
a population of 1 million or more closed
12,079 or more felony cases, compared to
4,921 or more for offices serving between
500,000 to 999,999.  The median number
of felony jury trial verdicts for offices
serving a district with population of 1
million or more (354) was almost 3 times
the median number of felony jury trial
verdicts for offices serving a district 
with population between 500,000 to 
999,999 (130).

Juveniles proceeded against in 
criminal courts in large districts

Almost all prosecutors' offices in large
districts (99%) proceeded against
juveniles in criminal court.  Over the
previous 12 months large district offices
reported proceeding against almost
11,000 juvenile cases in criminal court. 
Half of the offices proceeded against 
37 or more juvenile cases in criminal 
court. The median number of juvenile cases
proceeded against in criminal court by
offices serving 1 million or more residents
was 53 and for offices serving between
500,000 to 999,999 residents, 31. 

Forty-two percent of prosecutors' offices
in large districts reported a specialized
unit for handling juvenile cases in criminal
court, and 23% reported designated attorneys.  
Half of the offices maintained written guide-
lines about proceeding against juveniles in 
criminal court.  A specialized unit for 
handling juvenile cases in criminal court 
was reported by 46% of offices serving a 
district with a population between 500,000 
to 999,999 compared to 35% of offices serving 
a district with population of 1 million or
more. 

Offices serving 1 million or more
residents (35%) were more likely than
their smaller counterparts (18%) to
specifically designate attorneys to 
handle juvenile cases in criminal 
cases. 

Work-related threats or assaults
against staff in large districts

Seventy-one percent of prosecutors' offices 
in large districts indicated that a staff 
member experienced a work- related threat 
or assault.  The chief prosecutor was 
threatened or assaulted in 41% of the
offices, an assistant prosecutor in 65%,
and a staff investigator in 22%. 

Over half of the chief prosecutors and
over three-quarters of assistant prosecutors 
in offices serving 1 million or more received 
a work-related threat or assault.  About 60% 
of assistant prosecutors and 34% of chief 
prosecutors employed in offices that served 
a district between 500,000 to 999,999 
experienced a work-related threat or assault. 

Security measures in prosecutors'
offices in large districts

Prosecutors' offices in large districts
employed a variety of security measures
to protect their building and staff. Nearly
three-fourths of the offices reported using
building guards for protection, and two-
thirds indicated the presence of metal
detectors.  About 57% of offices in large
districts had electronic security systems. 
Police protection was used by 28% of the
offices.  Police protection was more likely
to be used by offices serving 1 million or
more (46%) than by offices serving
between 500,000 to 999,999 (21%).

The chief prosecutor carried a firearm for
personal safety or security in 20% of the
large districts (not shown in a table). 
Thirty-seven percent of offices in large
districts reported that an assistant
prosecutor carried a firearm for personal
safety, and 81% indicated a staff
investigator did so.

DNA evidence used by prosecutors'
offices in large districts

The use of DNA evidence is a common
practice in large district prosecutors'
offices as 100% reported using DNA
evidence during felony trials and 90%
used it during plea negotiations. Three-
fourths of the offices reported that
a State-operated forensic laboratory
performed the DNA analysis.  

A privately operated forensic laboratory
performed the DNA testing for 70% of the
offices, a forensic laboratory operated by
a local agency for 45%, and the FBI for
25%.  Forensic laboratories operated by
localities performed DNA analysis for 81%
of the offices in a district serving  of 
1 million or more, compared to 30% of the
offices serving between 500,000 to 999,999.
***Footnote 5: For more information on DNA 
laboratories, see the BJS report Survey of 
DNA Crime Laboratories, 2001, November 
2001, NCJ 179104.***  

When asked about problems in the use of
DNA evidence, about 70% of large district
offices reported at least one instance of
excessive delay in getting laboratory
results.  A quarter of the offices 
indicated improper collection of evidence 
by the police.  Difficulty in getting the 
DNA results admitted as evidence was
experienced at least once by 3% of the
large district offices.

Community prosecution in large
districts
          
Community prosecution is a proactive
approach used by prosecutors' offices 
to engage in community-based problem 
solving. Prosecutors' offices coordinate 
their work with law enforcement, 
residents, and agencies and organizations 
to improve public safety and quality of 
life.***Footnote 6: For more information 
on community prosecution see Elaine Nugent 
and Gerard A. Rainville, "The State of 
Community Prosecution: Results from a 
National Survey," The Prosecutor, March/
April 2001, pp. 26-33, and the Office of 
Justice Programs website http://www.ojp.
usdoj.gov/prosecution/commlinks.htm>.***

Over 80% of prosecutors' offices in large
districts involved the community to help
identify crime or problem areas and used
tools other than traditional criminal
prosecution to address community problems.  
About two-thirds of the offices indicated 
assigning prosecutors to specific geographic 
areas in the community. Three-fourths of 
the offices in large districts assigned 
prosecutors to handle community-related 
activities. 

All large district offices reported a 
formal or informal relationship with law
enforcement agencies.  Most offices also 
had formal or informal relationships with 
other government agencies (97%) and 
community associations (91%). About 84% 
of the offices reported a formal or 
informal relationship with private 
organizations.

Eighty-six percent of prosecutors' offices 
in large districts met regularly with school 
groups and with advocacy groups. About three-
quarters of the offices also indicated meeting 
regularly with neighborhood associations (76%), 
business groups (76%), and youth service 
organizations (72%).  Less than half (41%) of 
the offices met regularly with tenant's 
associations. 

Of the offices assigning prosecutors to
handle community-related activities, 55%
reported that these prosecutors were
located outside of the central prosecutors'
office.  Not shown in the table, of the
offices placing prosecutors who handled
community-related activities in outside
locations, 47% reported prosecutors
located in the police department and 47%
in a community-based office. The types of
offenses handled most often by prosecutors 
assigned to community related activities 
were property crime (75%), drug-related 
crime (74%), violent crime (63%), and 
juvenile crime (59%).  Half  (51%) of 
the large district offices that assigned 
prosecutors to community related activities 
indicated that these prosecutors carried a 
full caseload.

Methodology

Respondent selection
          
The 2001 National Survey of Prosecutors
(NSP) was a census of 2,341 chief
prosecutors in the United States that
handled felony cases in State courts 
of general jurisdiction.  In 2001 there 
were 2,341 prosecutorial districts in 
the Nation, each with one chief prosecutor. 
The Prosecutor Coordinator Office in each
State was contacted and asked to provide
the names and addresses of all chief
prosecutors in their State and the counties
for which these chief prosecutors served. 

The 114 prosecutors' offices that served a
district with a population of at least
500,000 or more residents are the basis of
this first report from the 2001 NSP.

Data collection

The data collection for the 2001 NSP was
conducted by the National Opinion Research 
Center (NORC) through a mailed questionnaire 
consisting of 35 questions on such topics 
as staffing, funding, special categories of 
felony prosecutions, caseload, juvenile 
matters, work-related threats or assaults, 
DNA evidence, and community related
activities.  The 2001 NSP questionnaire is
available at the BJS website
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov
/bjs/pub/pdf/nsp01.pdf>. 

In May 2001 NORC mailed the 2001 NSP
questionnaire to the 114 prosecutors'
offices that served districts with a 
population of 500,000 or more. The
remaining 2228 prosecutors' offices were
sent questionnaires in June 2001. After
the initial mailings, NORC engaged in an
extensive follow-up to obtain a returned
survey from each of the prosecutors'
offices.  The follow-up process involved
phone calls, e-mail communication,
re-mailing questionnaires, and sending
follow-up letters. Staff of the National
District Attorneys Associations as well as
the Prosecutor Coordinator Office in each
State assisted NORC in providing
follow-up.

NORC conducted additional telephone,
fax, and e-mail follow-up on completed
surveys to obtain responses to unanswered 
items and to clarify responses to other 
items.    

Survey response

The response rate for the 114 prosecutors' 
offices serving a district of 500,000 or 
more residents was 100%. 

Data imputations

NORC used the simple hot deck method,
in which a value was copied from a donor
case having similar values or related 
variables, to impute the data for the 
number of felony cases closed for 8 offices 
and for the number of juveniles proceeded 
against in criminal court for 4 offices.  
Specifically, NORC used prosecutorial 
district size to sort the 114 completed 
cases (prosecutor office surveys) in 
descending order.  A missing value for felony 
cases closed was imputed as the value of 
felony cases closed on the case that immediately
proceeded the case with missing data. 
Missing values for the number of juveniles
proceeded against in criminal court were
imputed in the same way.
