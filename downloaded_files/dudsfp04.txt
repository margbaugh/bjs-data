Highlights

In 2004 nearly a third of State and a quarter of Federal 
prisoners committed their offense under the influence 
of drugs, unchanged since 1997

* 17% of State and 18% of Federal prisoners committed 
their crime to obtain money for drugs. Violent offenders 
in State prison(50%)were less likely than drug(72%)and 
property (64%) offenders to have used drugs in the month 
prior to their offense.

Among drug dependent/abusing prisoners, 40% of State and 
49% of Federal inmates took part in drug abuse treatment 
or programs since admission to prison

* Among inmates who used drugs in the month before their 
offense, between 1997 and 2004 participation in drug abuse 
programs increased in both State (from 34% to 39%) and 
Federal prison (from 39% to 45%).

Among both State and Federal prisoners, white inmates were 
at least 20 times more likely than black inmates to report 
recent methamphetamine use

* State prisoner reports of methamphetamine use in the month 
before the offense rose from 7% in 1997 to 11% in 2004. 
Between 1997 and 2004, prior drug use by State prisoners was 
stable on all drug types except methamphetamine, which rose 
on all measures.

* Between 1997 and 2004, prior drug use by State prisoners 
was stable on all drug types except methamphetamine, which 
rose on all measures. 
-------------------------------------------------

Prior drug use among State prisoners remained stable on 
all measures between 1997 and 2004, according to the most 
recent findings from the Survey of Inmates in State and 
Federal Correctional Facilities. Over the same period,
the percentage of Federal inmates who reported prior drug 
use rose on all measures. For the first time, half(50%)of 
Federal inmates reported drug use in the month before their 
offense, up from 45% in 1997.

In the 2004 survey, BJS included measures of drug dependence
and abuse for the first time. These estimates were based on 
criteria specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV). Fifty-three 
percent of State and 45% of Federal prisoners met the 
DSM-IV criteria for drug dependence or abuse. 

Prisoners who met the criteria for recent drug dependence 
or abuse had extensive criminal records. Among State 
prisoners who were dependent on or abusing drugs, 53% 
had at least three prior sentences to probation or 
incarceration, compared to 32% of other inmates. At the 
time of their arrest, drug dependent or abusing State 
prisoners (48%) were also more likely than other inmates 
(37%) to have been on probation or parole supervision.

Overall drug use by State prisoners unchanged from 1997; 
methamphetamine use rose

A third of State inmates said they had committed their 
current offense while under the influence of drugs. Over 
half used drugs in the month before the offense, and 
more than two-thirds had used drugs regularly at some
time in their lives. These figures were unchanged from 
1997.

Marijuana remained the most common drug used by State
prisoners. Forty percent of State prisoners reported using 
marijuana in the month before their offense, and 15% said 
they had used marijuana at the time of the offense. All 
measures of marijuana use were within 1% of 1997 estimates.

Reported use of cocaine or crack cocaine in the month 
before the offense fell from 25% of State prisoners in 
1997 to 21% in 2004, while use at the time of offense 
fell from 15% to 12%. 

Over the same period, the use of heroin and other opiates 
fell slightly on all measures. Use of hallucinogens 
(including ecstasy) in the month before the offense rose 
slightly from 4% to 6%.

State prisoner reports of stimulant use went up on all
measures. Stimulant use in the month before the offense 
increased from 9% in 1997 to 12% in 2004, and use at the 
time of offense rose from 4% to 7%. 

The increases in the use of stimulants were attributable to
the rising use of methamphetamines. Use of methamphetamines 
in the month before the offense increased from 7% to 11%, 
and use at the time of the offense rose from 4% to 6%. 

Overall drug use by Federal prisoners rose; cocaine/crack 
use declined

Across all measures of use, Federal prisoners reported 
higher levels of prior drug use from 1997 to 2004. An 
estimated 26% of Federal inmates reported using drugs at 
the time of the offense, up from 22% in 1997. Drug use
in the month before the offense rose to 50% of Federal
prisoners, up from 45% in 1997.

During the period, marijuana use among Federal prisoners 
in the month before the offense rose from 30% to 36%. 
Stimulant use in the month before the offense grew slightly, 
due to methamphetamines which rose from 7% to 10%. Use of 
hallucinogens in the month before the offense rose from 2%
to 6%. 

Heroin or other opiate use among Federal prisoners remained
stable. In both years 3% of inmates committed their crimes 
while using heroin or other opiates. Depressant use was also 
unchanged.

The percentage of Federal prisoners who reported prior use 
of cocaine-based drugs dropped between 1997 and 2004. Use 
of cocaine or crack in the month before the offense fell 
slightly from 20% to 18%, and use at the time of the
offense fell from 9% to 7%. No other drug types displayed 
a decline in prior use during this period.

Women in Federal prison report 
sharp increase in prior drug use

Among Federal inmates, men (50%) were slightly more likely
than women (48%) to report drug use in the month before 
the offense in 2004. Drug use in the month before among 
women held in Federal prisons increased by more than 11
percentage points, up from 37% in 1997. Use by men was up 
from 45%.  

Women in State prisons in 2004 reported slightly lower 
levels of drug use in the month before the offense
(60%) than in 1997 (62%). The percentage of male State
prisoners who reported drug use in the month before their 
crimes remained unchanged (56% in both years). 

--------------------------------------------
Profile of methamphetamine users among State 
and Federal prisoners, 2004

Among State prisoners in 2004 —

* Female inmates (17%) were more likely than males (10%) 
to report use of methamphetamines in the month before 
their offense.

* White inmates (20%) were almost twice as likely as 
Hispanics (12%) to have used methamphetamines. Around 1% 
of black inmates reported using methamphetamines in the 
month before the offense.

* Violent offenders (6%) were half as likely to use 
methamphetamines as either drug (19%) or property 
(13%) offenders.

Similar patterns emerged among Federal inmates:

* Females (15%) were more likely than males(10%)to have 
used methamphetamine in the month before the offense.

* White inmates (29%) were 6 times more likely than 
Hispanics (5%) to report using methamphetamines. Black 
inmates (1%) reported low use of methamphetamines. 

* The percentage of drug offenders who reported use of 
methamphetamines (14%) was 3 times higher than that of 
violent or property offenders (4% of each).
--------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------
In 2004 an estimated 333,000 prisoner were for
drug law violations; 21% of State, 55% of Federal
inmates

Between the 1997 and 2004 prison inmate surveys, 
the number of drug offenders in State and Federal 
prisons grew by 57,000 inmates. Despite this 
numerical growth, drug offenders made up the same 
percentage of State prisoners in both 1997 and 2004 
(21%). The percentage of Federal prisoners serving 
time for drug offenses declined from 63% in 1997 to 
55% in 2004.

State drug offenders reported serious criminal 
records:

* 50% were on probation, parole, or escape at the time 
of their arrest;

* 78% had a prior sentence to incarceration or probation; 
46% had three or more prior sentences;

* 22% had a prior violent offense; 16% reported that all 
prior sentences were for drug offenses.

Drug offenders in Federal prisons had less extensive 
criminal records:

* 24% were on a criminal justice status at the time of 
their arrest;

* 62% had a prior sentence; 30% had three or more prior 
sentences;

* 16% had a prior violent offense; 15% reported prior 
sentences only for drug offenses.

Drug offenders in State prisons (45%) were 3 times more 
likely than those in Federal prisons (17%) to report a 
maximum sentence of less than 5 years. State drug 
offenders (15%) were half as likely as Federal drug 
offenders (28%) to report a sentence of 15 years or more. 
In part, the longer sentences for Federal drug offenders 
reflect the higher proportion of trafficking offenders 
and the more serious drug distribution crimes that fall 
under Federal jurisdiction. 

The percentage of drug offenders serving 
time for crimes involving stimulants nearly 
doubled between 1997 and 2004

Between 1997 and 2004, the percentage of drug offenders 
in State prisons serving time for drug law violations 
involving stimulants rose from 10% to 19%. These 
sentences covered possession, use, manufacture, and 
trafficking of stimulants. The percentage who reported 
the involvement of cocaine-based drugs in their offense 
dropped from 72% to 62%. The percentage of Federal drug 
offenders who reported sentences for crimes involving 
stimulants grew from 11% to 19%, while the percentage 
serving time for crimes involving marijuana fell from 
19% to 12%. 
--------------------------------------------

Among Federal inmates in 2004, 58% of whites, 53% of blacks,
and 38% of Hispanics reported using drugs in the month before 
the offense. With the exception of Hispanics, all racial/
ethnic groups of Federal inmates reported higher levels of 
drug use than in 1997.

State prisoner reports of prior drug use showed little
variation by race or Hispanic origin. In 2004, between 53% 
and 58% of all racial/ethnic groups reported using drugs 
in the month before the offense. In 1997 the same range
was reported across all groups. 

Prior drug use grew most quickly among middle-aged inmates

Drug use in the month before the offense was highest among 
the youngest inmates, and these percentages declined 
steadily with age. About two-thirds of State and Federal 
inmates age 24 or younger reported drug use in the month
before their offense, compared to a fifth of the inmates 
aged 55 or older.  

Despite the lower level of drug use among older offenders, 
the largest increase in prior drug use since 1997 was 
reported by middle-aged inmates. Among State prisoners 
aged 45 to 54, drug use in the month before the offense
rose from 40% to 47% in 2004. The increase reported by
middle-aged inmates in Federal prison was larger, rising 
from 35% to 45%.

1 in 4 violent offenders in prison committed their 
offenses under the influence of drugs

Nearly three-quarters (72%) of drug offenders in State 
prison reported drug use in the month before their offense. 
Property offenders (64%) were more likely than violent and 
public-order offenders (50% of each) to have used drugs in 
the month before the offense. Burglary (68%), robbery and 
larceny(67% of both)offenders reported the highest levels 
of drug use in the month of the offense.

Drug offenders(44%)were most likely to have committed their
crimes while using drugs, followed by property offenders 
(39%). About a quarter of both violent (28%) and public-
order(25%)offenders reported drug use at the time of their 
offense. Inmates serving time for sexual assault (17%) and 
aggravated assault (24%) were least likely to commit their 
crimes while under the influence of drugs.

An estimated 59% of Federal offenders held for drug 
trafficking reported using drugs in the month before their 
offense, followed by 57% of those held for robbery and 54% 
for weapons. About a quarter of Federal inmates (26%)
committed their crimes while under the influence of drugs, 
led by trafficking (34%) and robbery (29%) offenders. Federal 
fraud offenders (9%) were the least likely to commit their 
crimes while under the influence of drugs.

For most types of offenders, these findings showed little
change since 1997.  

1 in 3 property offenders in State prisons report drug 
money as a motive in their crimes

Fewer than a fifth (17%) of all State prisoners said they
committed their crimes to get money for drugs. By the type 
of offense, drug money as a motive in the offense varied 
widely. About 1 in 3 property offenders reported drug
money as a motive, followed by about 1 in 4 drug offenders.
Violent offenders(10%)and public-order offenders (7%) were 
least likely to report that they committed the offense to 
get money for drugs. 

Among Federal inmates the overall percentage who committed
their offense to get money for drugs(18%)was similar to 
State prisoners. A quarter of Federal drug offenders, 15% 
of violent offenders, and 11% of property offenders said
they committed their crimes for drug money.

53% of State and 45% of Federal prisoners met criteria 
for drug dependence or abuse 

More than half of State prisoners (53%) said they 
experienced symptoms consistent with drug dependence 
or abuse in the 12 months prior to their admission to 
prison. Seventeen percent reported symptoms that met
the criteria for drug abuse only. (See box below for 
abuse and dependence symptoms.)

Federal inmates (45%) were less likely to meet the drug
dependence or abuse criteria than State inmates.

-------------------------------------
Prevalence of drug dependence or abuse
symptoms among State and Federal
prisoners, 2004


The 2004 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal 
Correctional Facilities included questions to 
measure the prevalence of substance dependence or 
abuse as defined in the DSM-IV. These new estimates 
are not comparable to measures of prior drug use 
and related experiences in previous BJS surveys. 

Abuse symptoms included repeated drug use in hazardous 
situations or recurrent occupational, educational, 
legal or social problems related to drug use. Inmates 
reporting any of these symptoms in the 12 months prior 
to their admission met the abuse criteria. Recurrent 
social problems due to drug use (45% of State and 34% 
of Federal inmates) was the most commonly reported 
abuse symptom.

Dependence criteria covered a range of symptoms, 
including behavioral, cognitive, and physiological 
problems. Inmates reporting three or more symptoms 
in the 12 months before admission met the dependence 
criteria. Continued use despite emotional or 
psychological problems was the most common symptom 
reported by both State (36%) and Federal(28% inmates, 
followed by increasing tolerance (34% State and 28% 
Federal).
-------------------------------------

State and Federal prisoners were  more likely than other
adults in the U.S. resident population to meet the criteria 
for drug dependence or abuse. Using the same criteria, the 
National Epidemiologic Survey of Alcohol and Related
Conditions, 2002 (NESARC) measured the national prevalence 
of various substance abuse disorders. According to BJS's 
analysis of NESARC data, 2% of U.S. adult residents were 
dependent on or abusing drugs in the last 12 months.
 
In State prisons, violent offenders 
were least likely to meet criteria for
drug dependence or abuse 

An estimated 60% of female and 53% of male State prisoners
were dependent on or abusing drugs. White inmates in State 
prisons (59%) were most likely to meet the drug dependence 
or abuse criteria, followed by Hispanic(51%)and black(50%) 
inmates.

In Federal facilities 46% of male inmates and 43% of female
inmates were dependent on or abusing drugs in the year prior 
to their admission. White inmates(59%)reported higher levels 
of drug dependence or abuse than black(44%)or Hispanic 
(34%) inmates. 

State prisoners age 45 or older were less likely to report
drug dependence or abuse than other inmates. Between 55% 
and 60% of the under-45 age groups met the dependence or 
abuse criteria, compared to 47% of inmates age 45-54, and
18% of those age 55 or older. Among Federal inmates, drug
dependence or abuse declined steadily with age, from 58% 
of inmates 24 or younger to 21% of those age 55 or older.

Violent offenders(47%)were the only offender group in 
State prisons with less than half meeting the DSM-IV 
criteria for drug dependence or abuse. Property and drug 
offenders (63% of each) were the most likely to be drug
dependent or abusing.

Drug offenders(52%)were the only group of Federal inmates
with at least half meeting the drug dependence or abuse 
criteria. Property offenders (27%)reported the lowest 
percentage of drug dependence or abuse.

Half of drug dependent or abusing inmates in State 
prisons reported three or more prior sentences

Nearly half (48%) of State prisoners meeting the DSM-IV
criteria for drug dependence or abuse were on some form 
of criminal justice status(probation, parole, or escape) 
at the time of their arrest, compared to 37% of other 
State inmates. Federal inmates meeting the DSM-IV criteria
(30%) were slightly more likely to have been on a criminal 
justice status at the time of arrest than other Federal 
inmates (25%).

Drug dependent or abusing inmates in State prisons were 
more likely than other prisoners to have a prior offense 
(84% compared to 68%). More than half(53%)of drug dependent 
or abusing State prisoners reported at least three prior
sentences; a third(32%)of other State prisoners had three
or more prior sentences. 

1 in 7 drug dependent or abusing inmates in State prison were
homeless in year before admission

Drug dependent or abusing inmates were more likely than 
other inmates to report troubled personal backgrounds, 
including experiences of physical or sexual abuse, 
homelessness, unemployment, parental substance abuse, and 
parental incarceration. 

Drug dependent or abusing inmates in State prisons(14%)
were twice as likely as other inmates(6%)to report being 
homeless during the year before admission to prison. They 
also reported lower levels of employment in the month 
prior to admission (68% compared to 78% of other inmates).

While growing up, 42% of drug dependent or abusing State
prisoners received public assistance, 45% lived in single-
parent homes, and 41% had a substance-abusing parent. By 
comparison, 31% of other inmates received public 
assistance, 39% lived in single-parent homes, and 24% had 
a substance-abusing parent.

Reports of prior physical or sexual abuse were also higher
among drug dependent or abusing State prisoners(23%)than 
among other inmates(15%).

State prisoners  who were drug dependent or abusing were 
about twice as likely as other inmates to report past 
incarceration of either a mother(8% compared to 4%) or 
father(21% compared to 13%). A majority of drug dependent 
or abusing inmates (53%) reported the prior incarceration 
of a member of their immediate family (parent, sibling, 
child, or spouse), compared to 40% of other inmates.

Participation in drug abuse programs rose in both State and
Federal prison since 1997

The percentage of recent drug users in State prison who
reported participation in a variety of drug abuse 
programs rose from 34% in 1997 to 39% in 2004. This 
increase was the result of the growing percentage of 
recent drug users who reported taking part in self-help 
groups, peer counseling and drug abuse education programs 
(up from 28% to 34%). Over the same period, the percentage 
of recent drug users taking part in drug treatment
programs with a trained professional was almost unchanged 
(15% in 1997, 14% in 2004). 

Participation in drug abuse programs also increased among
Federal inmates who had used drugs in the month before 
their offense, from 39% in 1997 to 45% in 2004. While there 
was no change in percentage of these inmates who had 
undergone drug treatment with a trained professional(15% in 
both years), the percentage taking part in other drug abuse 
programs rose from 32% in 1997 to 39% in 2004.

Number of Federal prisoners taking part in drug abuse 
programs up 90% between 1997 and 2004

With the continued growth in the State prisoner population,
the estimated number of inmates reporting drug use in the 
month before the offense rose from 598,700 in 1997 to 
686,700 in 2004. Among these users the number who took part
in any drug abuse programs rose from 205,300 to 269,200.

More than 9,000 additional State inmates reported receiving
professional drug treatment. However, the largest increase 
was seen in the number of inmates taking part in self-help/
peer counseling groups and drug abuse education classes, up 
62,000 since 1997.

During the period, the estimated number of Federal inmates 
who reported drug use in the month before their offense rose 
by 25,000 inmates from 39,900 to 64,900. In 2004, an estimated 
9,900 Federal prisoners with a recent drug use history 
had been in a drug treatment program with a trained 
professional, up from an estimated 6,100 in 1997.

The number of inmates taking part in self-help or peer
counseling groups and drug abuse education classes 
increased by more than 12,000 inmates. The number of 
recent drug users receiving some type of drug abuse 
program in Federal prisons rose by 90% (from 15,500 to 
29,400 prisoners).

Over 250,000 dependent/abusing State inmates took part 
in drug abuse programs since admission

In 2004, about 642,000 State prisoners were drug dependent 
or abusing in the year before their admission to prison. 
An estimated 258,900 of these inmates (or 40%) had taken 
part in some type of drug abuse program. These
inmates were more than twice as likely to report 
participation in self-help or peer counseling groups and 
education programs (35%) than to receive drug treatment 
from a trained professional (15%).

In Federal prison, a higher percentage of drug dependent 
or abusing inmates (49%) reported taking part in some type 
of drug abuse programs. Nearly 1 in 3 took part in drug 
abuse education classes, and 1 in 5 had participated in
self-help or peer counseling groups. Overall, 17% took 
part in drug treatment programs with a trained 
professional, and 41% had participated in other drug 
abuse programs.

Methodology 

The findings in this report are based on the data in the
Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional 
Facilities, 2004. Conducted every 5 or 6 years since 1974 
(Federal facilities were added for the first time in 1991), 
the inmate surveys are the only national source of detailed
information on criminal offenders, particularly special 
populations such as drug and alcohol users and offenders 
who have mental health problems.

The survey design included a stratified two-stage sample 
where facilities were selected in the first stage and 
inmates to be interviewed in the second stage. In the 
second sampling stage, interviewers from the Census
Bureau visited each selected facility and systematically 
selected a sample of inmates. Computer-assisted personal 
interviewing (CAPI) was used to conduct the interviews.

Survey of Inmates in State and Federal 
Correctional Facilities, 2004 

The State prison sample was selected from a universe of 
1,585 facilities. A total of 287 State prisons participated 
in the survey; 2 refused, 11 were closed or had no inmates 
to survey, and 1 was erroneously included in the universe. 
A total of 14,499 inmates in the State facilities were 
interviewed; 1,653 inmates refused to participate, 
resulting in a second-stage nonresponse rate of 10.2%.

The Federal prison sample was selected from 148 Federal
prisons and satellite facilities. Thirty-nine of the 40 
prisons selected participated in the survey. After the 
initial sample of inmates was drawn, a secondary sample 
of 1 in 3 drug offenders was selected. A total of 3,686 
inmates in Federal facilities were interviewed and 567 
refused to participate, resulting in a second-stage
nonresponse rate of 13.3%.

Accuracy of survey estimates

The accuracy of the survey estimates depends on sampling 
and measurement errors. Sampling errors occur by chance 
because a sample of inmates rather than all inmates were 
interviewed. Measurement error can be attributed to many
sources, such as nonresponse, recall difficulties, 
differences in the interpretation of questions among 
inmates, and processing errors.

The sampling error, as measured by an estimated standard
error, varies by the size of the estimate and the size of 
the base population. These standard errors may be used to 
construct confidence intervals around percentages. 

Estimates of the standard errors have been calculated for 
the 2004 surveys population base estimates). For example, 
the 95% confidence interval around the percentage of 
Federal inmates in 2004 who had used drugs in the month
before their current offense is approximately 50.2% plus 
or minus 1.96 times 1.41% (or 47.4% to 53.0%).

A detailed description of the methodology for the State 
and Federal Prison survey, including standard error tables 
and links to other reports or findings, is available on 
the BJS Website <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/ 
sicf04.htm>.

Measures of drug dependence and 
abuse in the general population

Caution should be used when making comparisons between 
prison inmates and the general population based on the 
12-month DSM-IV structured interview. There are significant 
variations in questionnaire design and data analysis. For
example, questions on the severity or duration of symptoms 
and questions about whether symptoms are due to bereavement, 
substance use, or a medical condition may vary from survey 
to survey.

Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions,

Alcoholism, see the Data Reference Manual,

the prevalence of drug dependence and abuse in the general 
population, see the National Survey on Drug Use and Health,
