Highlights

HIV-positive and confirmed AIDS
cases among inmates drop in 2000

*  Between 1995 and 2000 the number of 
HIV-positive prisoners grew at a slower 
rate (3%) than the overall prison 
population (16%).

*  At yearend 2000, 3.6% of all female 
State prison inmates were HIV positive, 
compared to 2.2% of males.

*  During 2000, 18 States reported a
decrease in the number of HIV-positive 
prisoners and 29 States reported an 
increase. 

*  New York held nearly a quarter of all 
inmates (6,000 inmates) known to be HIV 
positive at yearend 2000.

*  Virginia with an increase of 220 HIV-
positive inmates reported the largest 
increase, followed by Maryland (up 178) and 
Alabama (up 136). New York with 1,000 fewer 
HIV-positive inmates reported the largest 
drop.

*  The overall rate of confirmed AIDS 
among the Nation's prison population 
(0.52%) was about 4 times the rate in 
the U.S. general population (0.13%).

*  Among Federal inmates, 21 died from 
AIDS-related causes, up from 16 in 1999.

*  During 2000, Florida (48) and New 
Jersey (20) reported the most AIDS-
related deaths.

*  In 1999 the AIDS-related death rate 
(20 per 100,000) was lower for State 
prisoners than for a comparable group 
in the general population (25 per 100,
000).

On December 31, 2000, 2.2% of State prison 
inmates, and 0.8% of Federal prison inmates 
were known to be infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Correctional 
authorities reported that 24,074 State 
inmates and 1,014 Federal inmates were HIV
positive.  The number known to be HIV 
positive totaled 25,088 down from 25,801 
at yearend 1999.

Of those known to be HIV positive in all 
U.S. prisons at yearend 2000, 5,528 were 
confirmed AIDS cases, down from 6,642 in 
1999. This was the first decrease in the 
number of confirmed AIDS cases since data
collection started in 1991. Among State 
inmates, 0.6% had AIDS; among Federal 
inmates, 0.2%.

During 2000, 174 State prisoners and 21 
Federal prisoners died from AIDS-related 
causes.  State prisons had the fewest AIDS-
related deaths in 10 years -- less than a 
fifth of the number (1,010) recorded 
during the peak year in 1995. In 2000, 6% 
of State inmate deaths were attributed to 
AIDS, down from 32% in 1995.

This report is based on the 2000
National Prisoners Statistics (NPS-1) and 
the 2000 Census of State and Federal Adult 
Correctional Facilities.  Data from the 
NPS were provided by the departments of 
corrections in 50 States and the District 
of Columbia and by the Federal Bureau of 
Prisons.  Data from the Census were 
provided by 1,504 facilities for June 30, 
2000.

Number of HIV-infected prison
inmates at yearend 2000 down
from 1999

At yearend 2000, 25,088 inmates in State 
and Federal prisons were known to be 
infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), down from 25,801 in 1999. 
Among State prison inmates, 24,074 were 
known to be HIV positive; among Federal 
inmates, 1,014. 

HIV-infected inmates were concentrated in 
a small number of States.  New York (6,000), 
Florida (2,640), and Texas (2,492) held the
largest number of HIV-positive inmates.  
These three States housed nearly half of 
all HIV-infected inmates in State prisons 
in 2000.  HIV-positive inmates comprised 
2.2% of the State prison population in 2000, 
down from 2.4% in 1995. In Federal prisons, 
HIV-positive inmates comprised 0.8% in 2000, 
the lowest rate since reporting began in 
1991. Overall, the percent of the total 
prison population with HIV decreased from 
2.1% in 1999 to 2.0% in 2000. 
 
Inmates in the Northeast had the
highest rates of HIV infection

Within the Northeast, 5.2% of the prison 
population were known to be HIV positive in 
2000, followed by 2.3% in the South, 1.1% 
in the Midwest, and 0.9% in the West. New 
York had the highest percentage of inmates 
known to be HIV positive (8.5%), followed 
by Maryland (4.3%), and Florida (3.7%).

Three States (North Dakota, South Dakota, 
and Wyoming) reported 10 or fewer cases of 
HIV-positive inmates in their prisons. In 
2000 every reporting jurisdiction held at
least one HIV-positive inmate. Six States 
reported that fewer than 0.5% of their 
inmate population were HIV positive.  

Between 1999 and 2000, 18 States reported 
a decrease in the number of HIV-positive 
inmates.  The largest decrease was reported 
in New York -- 6,000 in 2000, down from 
7,000 in 1999.  Twenty-nine States reported 
an increase.  The largest increases were 
reported in Virginia (up 220), Maryland 
(178), and Alabama (136). 

A greater percent of females than
males with HIV infection 

On December 31, 2000, there were 19,935 male 
inmates and 2,243 female inmates in State 
prisons known to be HIV positive. Overall,
2.2% of male inmates and 3.6% of all female 
inmates were known to be HIV positive. The 
rate of HIV infection was higher among 
females than among males in all regions
and in most States.

New York reported the largest number of male 
and female HIV-positive inmates (5,400 and
600, respectively).  The second largest 
number of HIV-positive male and female 
inmates were in Florida (2,269 and 371, 
respectively)followed by Texas (2,220 and 
272, respectively). Four States (Maine,
North Dakota, Hawaii, and Wyoming) reported 
having no HIV-positive female inmates. No 
State reported zero HIV-positive male 
inmates.

In six States and the District of Columbia, 
more than 5% of all female inmates were known 
to be HIV positive.  In two jurisdictions
over 15% of all female inmates were known to 
be HIV positive   the District of Columbia 
(41.0%) and New York (18.2%).  New York
(with 8.0%) was the only State with more 
than 5% of their male inmates known to be 
HIV positive. 

Number of HIV-positive female
inmates rose during 2000 

In States that did not provide a breakdown of 
the number of HIV cases by gender, estimates 
were made to provide comparable year-to-year 
data. Estimates were made using the distribution 
from the most recent year in which data 
were reported.  Based on these yearend 
estimates, the number of HIV infected 
females increased from 2,402 to 2,472 
during 2000. The number of infected male 
inmates decreased from 22,175 in 1999 to 
21,894 in 2000. On average, from 1995 to 
2000 the estimated number of male State 
prisoners infected with HIV increased 
annually by 0.7%; and the number of 
female prisoners by 2.1%.

While the estimated number of both male 
and female HIV-positive inmates in State 
prisons has increased since 1995, the
percentage of male HIV-positive inmates 
has remained nearly stable, fluctuating 
between 2.3% and 2.1%, and the percentage 
of female inmates has decreased from 4.0% 
in 1995 to 3.4% in 2000.

The number of confirmed AIDS
cases in U.S. prisons decreased
during 2000

At the end of 2000, 5,528 inmates in U.S. 
prisons had confirmed AIDS, down from 6,642 
in 1999.  Among those with confirmed AIDS, 
5,230 were in State prisons and 298 were
in Federal prisons.  

Confirmed AIDS cases made up 0.6% of inmates 
in State prisons and 0.2% of those in Federal
prisons.  Of those known to be HIV-positive 
inmates, over a fifth had confirmed AIDS.

The States with the largest number of 
confirmed AIDS cases were New York (1,100), 
Texas (922), Florida (768), and Maryland 
(325). Combined, these States held more
than half of all confirmed AIDS cases in 
State prisons. Fifteen States reported 
having fewer than 10 confirmed AIDS cases 
in their prisons.

New York (1.6%) reported the highest percentage 
of confirmed AIDS, followed by Connecticut
(1.5%), Maryland (1.4%), and Massachusetts 
(1.3%).  In 15 States, confirmed AIDS cases
comprised 0.1% or less of State inmates.

During 2000, 19 States and the District of 
Columbia reported a decrease in the number 
of confirmed AIDS cases.  Excluding
California which had 224 HIV/AIDS cases 
awaiting classification, Texas with a 
decrease of 72, had the largest drop in 
the number of confirmed AIDS cases, 
followed by New York (down 70).  Sixteen 
States reported an increase in the number 
of confirmed AIDS cases, led by Washington 
up from 7 in 1999 to 74 in 2000.

Because some States each year did not 
provide a breakdown of the number of 
HIV cases by type of HIV infection, 
estimates of the number of confirmed 
AIDS cases were made for those States 
to provide comparable year-to-year data. 
Based on yearly estimates, the number 
of confirmed AIDS cases decreased from 
7,039 in 1999 to 6,520 in 2000. Overall, 
since 1995 the estimated number of 
confirmed AIDS cases has increased by 
1,363. 

Rate of confirmed AIDS higher
among prison inmates than U.S.
general population

In every year since 1991, the rate of 
confirmed AIDS has been higher among 
prison inmates than in the general 
population.  At yearend 2000 the rate of
confirmed AIDS in State and Federal prisons 
was about 4 times higher than in the total 
U.S. population.  About 52 in every
10,000 prison inmates had confirmed AIDS, 
compared to 13 in 10,000 persons in the 
U.S. general population. 

About a third of prisoners with
confirmed AIDS were held in 25
facilities

Data on confirmed AIDS cases from the 2000 
Census of State and Federal Adult 
Correctional Facilities was collected from 
1,504 facilities. At midyear 2000, 25 
facilities held nearly a third (1,995) of 
the 6,011 inmates with AIDS.  The facility
holding the largest number of inmates with 
confirmed AIDS was the Stiles Unit in Texas 
(452), followed by the Broad River
Correctional Institution in South Carolina 
(217), the Central Florida Reception Center 
in Florida (140), and the Mohawk Correctional 
Facility in New York (111).  These 4 
facilities housed about 15% of all inmates 
with confirmed AIDS.

Two facilities reported that more than 1 
in 7 of their inmates had confirmed AIDS; 
Broad River Correctional Institution in 
South Carolina (21%) and Stiles Unit in
Texas (16%).

Nearly a quarter of HIV-positive
prisoners were housed in medical 
treatment facilities

The 2000 Census of State and Federal Adult 
Correctional Facilities identified 135 
facilities that had medical treatment as 
either a primary or secondary function. 
These facilities held 4,662 inmates known 
to be HIV positive.  Fifty-one percent of 
HIV-positive inmates in facilities that 
primarily function as a medical facility 
had confirmed AIDS; among those with HIV 
in facilities where medical treatment 
is a secondary function, 30% had confirmed 
AIDS. The majority of inmates known to be 
HIV positive were held in general population
facilities. 

AIDS-related deaths in State
prisons have dropped by more
than 80% since 1995 

The number of State inmates who died of 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, Kaposis's 
sarcoma, or other AIDS-related diseases
peaked in 1995 and has been steadily 
decreasing. Between 1995 and 2000 the number 
of AIDS-related deaths decreased from 1,010 
to 174.  AIDS-related deaths accounted for 
6% of all deaths among State prisoners in 
2000, down from 32% in 1995.

With the introduction of protease
inhibitors and combination antiretroviral 
therapies, there has been vast improvement 
in the quality and effectiveness in HIV/
AIDS care. 

After being the second leading cause of 
death since 1991, AIDS-related illnesses 
are now the third leading cause of death 
in State prisons following deaths due to 
natural causes (2,139), and suicides (185).

Among Federal inmates, 21 died from AIDS-
related causes up from 16 in 1999. In 2000 
for every 100,000 inmates, 14 died from
AIDS-related causes. These AIDS related 
deaths accounted for more than 7% of all 
deaths in Federal prison. 

Fewer deaths reported in all
jurisdictions in 2000 compared
to 1995

In 2000,for every 100,000 State inmates, 
14 died from AIDS-related causes compared 
to 109 per 100,000 in 1995.  The most AIDS
deaths were reported in the South (91), 
followed by the Northeast (52). Together, 
these two regions accounted for more than 
three-quarters of AIDS-related deaths in 
State prisons.

Florida reported the largest number of AIDS-
related deaths (48), followed by New Jersey 
(20), and Pennsylvania (13). Twenty-four
States reported having no AIDS-related deaths.

Relative to the number of inmates, the District 
of Columbia had the highest rate of AIDS-
related deaths (80 per 100,000), followed by 
New Jersey and Florida (67 per 100,000
inmates), New Hampshire and Connecticut (44 
per 100,000), and Pennsylvania (35 per 100,
000). 

AIDS deaths as a percent of all deaths 
in State prison more than two and a 
half that in the general population
 
The percentage of deaths because of AIDS 
is about 21/2 times higher in the prison 
population than in the U.S. general 
population age 15-54. In 1999 about 1 in 
every 9 prisoner deaths were attributable 
to AIDS-related causes compared to fewer 
than 1 in 20 deaths in the general 
population.

AIDS death rate lower for State 
prisoners than for comparable 
general population

Although AIDS deaths represent a higher 
percentage of all deaths among prisoners 
than in the general population, the rate 
of AIDS-related deaths (20 per 100,000) 
for State inmates in 1999 was significantly 
lower than the rate (25 per 100,000) for 
a comparable group in the general
population.

To compare death rates, a rate of death 
for a comparable population was estimated 
by weighting AIDS-related death rates in 
the general population by the percent of
State prisoners in each gender and racial/
ethnic subgroup. A weighted average (24.6 
per 100,000) was calculated by summing 
these weights.  This average represents 
the rate of death due to AIDS for persons 
in the general population based on a 
similar composition of men and women, and 
whites, blacks, Hispanics, and persons 
of other races.

20 States and the Federal Bureau
of Prisons test all inmates for HIV
at admission or while in prison 

Data on HIV prevalence rates are reported 
in the National Prisoners Statistics series 
(NPS) by prison officials.  The quality of 
the information reported may vary by the 
circumstances under which inmates were 
tested.  Circumstances range from testing 
all inmates to testing only upon inmate 
request. 

Each State, the District of Columbia,
and the Federal Bureau of Prisons test
their inmates for HIV based on certain
criteria.  Most jurisdictions (51) test
inmates if they have HIV-related
symptoms or if the inmates request a
test.  Forty States and the Federal
Bureau of Prisons test inmates after
they are involved in an incident, and 15
States test inmates who belong to
specific "high-risk groups." 

Missouri, Alabama, Nevada, and the
Federal Bureau of Prisons test 
inmates upon their release. 

Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, South 
Carolina, and Nevada test all inmates 
currently in custody. Three States (New 
York, Virginia, and Oregon) and the 
Federal Bureau of Prisons test inmates 
selected at random.

Since 1991 the number of jurisdictions 
reporting each testing policy has remained 
relatively stable with the exception on 
those testing based on involvement in an
incident.  In 2000 42 reported testing 
those involved in an incident, up from 20 
in 1991.

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The National Prisoner Statistics series 
(NPS-1)includes yearend counts of prisoners 
by jurisdiction, gender, race, Hispanic 
origin, and admissions and releases during 
the year.  The series consists of reports
from the departments of corrections of the 
50 States, the District of Columbia, and 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  Since 1991
respondents have indicated the circumstances 
under which inmates are tested for HIV and 
have provided the number of HIV-infected 
inmates in their custody.

Census of State and Federal Adult
Correctional Facilities

The 2000 Census of State and Federal Adult 
Correctional Facilities was the sixth 
enumeration of State institutions sponsored 
by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Earlier
censuses were completed in 1974, 1979, 1984, 
1990, and 1995.  

The facility universe was developed from the 
1995 census.  Each department of corrections 
was contacted to identify new facilities and 
facilities that had been closed since June 30, 
1995.  Data were collected from all facilities, 
resulting in a final response rate of 100%. 
Facilities were included in the census if they 
had separate staffs; housed primarily State 
or Federal prisoners; were physically, 
functionally, and administratively separate; 
and operational on June 30, 2000. Overall, 
the census identified 84 Federal facilities, 
1,295 State facilities, 22 facilities under 
State and local authority, 3 facilities 
operated by the District of Columbia, and 
264 privately operated facilities. 

The census included the following types of 
adult correctional facilities: prisons and 
penitentiaries; boot camps; prison farms; 
reception, diagnostic, and classification
centers; road camps, forestry and conservation 
camps; youthful offender facilities (except 
in California); vocational training
facilities; prison hospitals; drug and
alcohol treatment facilities; and State-
operated local detention facilities (in 
Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, 
Rhode Island, and Vermont).

AIDS in the U.S. resident 
population

The number of persons with confirmed AIDS 
in the U.S. general population (age 13 and
over) was derived from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, yearend
editions 1995-99. For each year the number 
of active AIDS cases in the United States 
was calculated by subtracting the number 
of cumulative AIDS deaths for people age 
15 and older at yearend from the cumulative
number of total AIDS cases for people age 
13 and older at yearend as listed in the 
HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report.

The rate of confirmed AIDS cases in
the U.S. resident population was calculated 
by dividing the annual totals for individuals 
with AIDS by the population estimates for the
U.S. resident population of individuals 13 
and older.  

AIDS-related deaths in the United
States

The number of AIDS-related deaths for persons 
age 15-54 was derived from the CDC, HIV/AIDS
Surveillance Report, yearend editions. Deaths 
in the U.S. population for persons age 15-54
were taken from the CDC, Monthly Vital 
Statistics Report, Vol. 42, No. 2(S); Vol. 
43, No. 12;  Vol. 43, No. 6(S); Vol. 45, No. 
3(S); and Vol. 45, No. 11(S); and from CDC, 
National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 47, 
No. 9; Vol. 47, No. 25; Vol. 48, No. 11;
and Vol. 49, No. 8.

AIDS-related deaths as a percentage of all 
deaths in the U.S. population were calculated 
by dividing the national estimate of AIDS 
deaths of  persons age 15-54 by the national 
mortality estimates of persons age 15-54 in 
a given year.
