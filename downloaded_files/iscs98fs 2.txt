JOINT JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND EDUCATION 
DEPARTMENT REPORT SHOWS MOST CRIME AGAINST
STUDENTS OCCURS AWAY FROM SCHOOLS

       WASHINGTON, D.C.--Key indicators of school
crime and safety show that few of the murders and
suicides of youth occur at school; students are
victims of fewer nonfatal crimes of serious
violence (rape, robbery or aggravated assault) at
school than when they are away from school; and
most schools did not report any serious violent
crimes to police in 1996.   These were major
findings presented in a joint report on school
crime and safety released today by the Departments
of Justice and Education.

       During the 1992-94 school years (the most
recent for which data were available), 76 students
were murdered or committed suicide at school.  By
contrast, in the 1992-93 calendar years combined, 
more than 7,000 juveniles age 5-19 were murdered
and more than 4,000 committed suicide in all
locations.  

       In 1996 students age 12-18 were victims of
about 225,000 incidents of nonfatal serious
violent crime at school and about 671,000
incidents away from school. (This sentence was revised
4/20/99) 

       In 1996-97, 10 percent of all public schools
reported at least one serious violent crime
(murder, rape or other type of sexual battery,
suicide, physical attack, robbery or fight with a
weapon) to the police or a law enforcement
representative. Another 47 percent reported at
least one less serious violent or nonviolent
crime.  The remaining 43 percent of public schools
did not report any of these crimes to the police.

       The report was produced to provide source
material for the statistical section of the Annual
Report on School Safety: 1998, to be released on
October 15.  President Clinton directed that the
Attorney General and Secretary of Education issue
a report annually to provide information that
educators and parents can use to address their
school crime problems.  The report on indicators
of school crime and safety drew on data from a
comprehensive array of sources to present the
perspectives of students, teachers, principals and
the general population.  Data for crime away from
school are also presented to place school crime in
the context the larger society.

       Among other findings presented by the report:

       The percentage of 12th graders injured in
violence at school has not changed over the 
20-year period, 1976-96, although the percentage
threatened with injury showed a very slight
overall upward trend.    

       Elementary schools were much less likely than
either middle or high schools to report any type
of crime to the police in 1996-97.   They were
much more likely to report vandalism (31 percent)
than any of the other crimes (19 percent or less). 

       The report includes findings related to
victimization of teachers in school as well as
school environment.   Middle school or junior high
school teachers are the most vulnerable to violent
crime, and elementary school teachers the least
vulnerable, although most such crimes were simple
assaults.   Over the 5-year period 1992-96,
teachers overall were victims of about 316,000
nonfatal violent and property crimes per year at
school, including 18,000 serious violent crimes.  

       Students reported a mixed picture of their
school environment associated with crime and
safety, with increased percentages over time of:
       --students avoiding places at school out of   
         fear
       --reported gang presence
       --seniors using marijuana and stimulants at   
         school
and decreased percentages of--
       --male seniors carrying a weapon at school
       --seniors drinking at school
       --seniors taking drugs at school.

     Because the report relied on so many
different data sources, many of the indicators
refer to different time periods and present
findings for different sets of people, and may
utilize different definitions for key terms.
