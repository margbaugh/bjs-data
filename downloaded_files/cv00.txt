Highlights

Violent crime rates fell 15% between 1999
and 2000, resulting in the greatest annual
percentage decline and the lowest rates of
violent crime recorded since the inception
of the NCVS in 1973.

*  According to National Crime
Victimization Survey, the violent crime
rate fell 15% and the property crime rate
fell 10%, 1999-2000.  

*  Violent victimization and property 
crime rates in 2000 are the lowest 
recorded since the NCVS' inception in 
1973.***Footnote 1: Based on adjustments
to pre-1992 estimates to account for the
1992 redesign of the NCVS.*** 

*  The overall violent crime rate decline
resulted from a decrease in simple assault
and rape/sexual assault coupled with a
slight fall in aggravated assault during
2000.

*  Overall property crime rates fell
between 1999 and 2000 due to a decrease 
in theft and a slight decline in motor 
vehicle theft. 

*  From 1999 to 2000 violent crime rates
fell for almost every demographic group
considered: males, females, whites,
blacks, non-Hispanics, and 12-to- 24
year-olds.  Violent crime against
Hispanics also fell somewhat during the 
period.
   
*  48% of violent victimizations and 
36% of property crimes were reported to 
the police in 2000.  

*  From 1999 to 2000 the number of crimes 
of violence, completed or threatened, 
dropped about 1 million from 7.4 million 
to 6.3 million.

*  The majority of violent crime victims
(67%) do not face an armed offender. 
Rape/sexual assault victims (6%) were
the least likely, while robbery victims
(55%) were the most likely, to face an
armed offender.
------------------------------------------------------

Approximately 25.9 million violent and
property victimizations occurred during 
the year 2000, according to data from 
the National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS).  Property crimes against U.S. 
households   burglary, motor vehicle
theft, and theft   accounted for three-
fourths of all victimizations.  Violent
crimes  -- rape, sexual assault, robbery, 
and aggravated and simple assault -- 
against persons age 12 or older accounted 
for about a fourth.  Personal theft --
pocket picking and purse snatching -- 
comprised 1% of victimizations.  

In 2000 the estimated 25.9 million 
victimizations represented a decline
from 28.8 million property and violent
crimes experienced in 1999.  The 2000 
level of violent crime continued a 
downward trend that began in 1994 and 
the 2000 level of property crime is the 
lowest since 1974.  The number of criminal
victimizations estimated for 2000 is the
lowest ever recorded since 1973 when the 
NCVS began and measured 44 million 
victimizations.

A rate of 28 violent victimizations per 
1,000 persons age 12 or older in the year 
2000 represents a 15% decrease from the
1999 rate (33 per 1,000).  The 2000 violence 
rate was 44% less than the 50 per 1,000
in 1993, which was the first year a full
sample was interviewed using the NCVS 
redesign.     

---------------------------------
Victimization trends,
1973-2000

The National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS) was initiated in 1973.  Refined 
by improvements like the 1992 redesign, 
the NCVS now can trace 27-year trends in 
U.S. criminal victimization.
***Footnote 2: For more information about
the redesign, see The Effects of the Redes-
ign on Victimization Estimates (NCJ 164381),

(NCJ 151169), National Crime Victimization
Survey Redesign: Fact Sheet (NCJ 151170),
Technical Background (NCJ 151172), and the 
Questions & Answers (NCJ 151171).***

Record lows

The 15% drop in violent crime rates, 1999-
2000, is the largest single-year percent 
decrease ever measured by the NCVS.  Among 
crimes the NCVS accounts for,  the year 2000 
rates per 1,000 persons or households for
overall violent crime (28), simple assault 
(18), and household theft (138) were the 
lowest ever recorded.  Other crime rates 
registered at their lowest point but were 
still  not significantly different from the 
1999 rates.  These  rates included --
*  3 robberies and 6 aggravated assaults
per 1,000 persons
*  32 burglaries and 9 motor vehicle thefts
per 1,000 households.

Violent crime

Violent crime victimization rates fluctuated 
between 1973 and 1994.  Beginning in 1994,
the violent crime rate steadily declined. 
Ten percent reductions in the violent crime
rate occurred between 1994 and 1995 and 
between 1995 and 1996, followed by 7% 
decreases between 1996 and 1997 and between 
1997 and 1998.  

Robbery rates have moved in concert with overall
violent crime rates. Initially, through 1978,
robbery rates fell and then reversed course and
increased until 1981.  The increase continued 
at a slower pace through 1985. The robbery rate 
then rose slowly until 1994 when it began to
decrease.
 
Aggravated assault rates declined with some 
interruptions from 1974 to the mid-1980's. 
Following several years of minimal increases 
and decreases, the aggravated assault rate 
increased from 1990 to 1993.  In 1994 and
afterward, the aggravated assault rate fell 
steadily, reaching the current level at half 
the 1994 rate (12 per 1,000). 

Simple assault, the most common form of 
violent crime measured by the NCVS, increased
from 1974 to 1977 and remained stable until
1979.  The rate then declined until 1989, when
it increased through 1994. After 1994 the rate 
fell to the lowest level to date -- 18 per 
1,000 persons.

Property crime

Aside from a 1973-74 increase, property 
crime rates have fallen throughout NCVS 
history.  

The burglary rate, after a period of slow
decline interrupted by an increase from 1980 
to 1981, fell each year.  The 2000 burglary 
rate was about a third of the 1973 adjusted 
rate.

Motor vehicle theft rates, despite some 
periods of increase, primarily declined from 
1973 through 2000.  The 2000 rate of 9 per 
1,000 households was half that of 1973 
(19 motor vehicle thefts per 1,000 households).

Thefts increased between 1973 and 1974, then
remained stable until 1977.  After 1978 theft
rates declined steadily, reaching the lowest 
recorded rate in 2000. 
--------------------------------

The apparent increase in personal theft rates
from 0.9 per 1,000 persons in 1999 to 1.2 
per 1,000 persons in 2000 was not statistically
significant.

The rates of property victimization fell 10%
from 1999 to 2000, from 198 to 178 property 
crimes per 1,000 households.  The 2000
estimate of property crime continued a steady 
downward trend that began in 1974.  

Criminal victimization, 1999 to 2000

Violent crime

The NCVS collects data on nonfatal violent 
crimes against persons age 12 or older in the 
United States.  These crimes may or may not 
have been reported to the police. The Uniform 
Crime Reporting (UCR) Program of the FBI 
collects data on homicide.  
         
Violent crimes measured by the NCVS

Overall violent victimization refers to rape, 
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, 
and simple assault.  Overall violent victimization
rates declined 15% from 33 to 28 victimizations
per 1,000 persons between 1999 and 2000.  A
significant decline in the rate of attempted or
threatened violent crime coupled with a slight 
decline in the rate of completed violent crime
contributed to this decrease in overall
violence.

The rates of simple assault and rape/sexual 
assault decreased significantly between
1999 and 2000.  Aggravated assault rates fell
slightly, while the apparent decrease in the 
robbery rate was not significant.

The decline in violent victimization rates was
experienced by almost every demographic group
considered between 1999 and 2000.  The rate at
which males, females, whites, blacks, and non-
Hispanic persons were violently victimized 
decreased significantly between 1999 and 2000.

Hispanics were victimized at slightly lower 
rates in 2000 than 1999.  There was no
significant difference between the years in 
the rates at which persons of "other" races 
(Asians, Native Hawaiians, other Pacific 
Islanders, Alaska Natives, and American Indians
considered together) were victimized.

Violent victimization rates fell significantly
for persons ages 12-24 and ages 35-49. 
The decline in victimization of persons
between 12 and 24 is noteworthy because
they have historically experienced the
highest rates of violent victimization.

No clear association existed between the
categories of annual household income
and changes from 1999 to 2000 in violent
victimization rates.

Compared to 1999, persons who had
never married or who were divorced or
separated had significantly lower violent
victimization rates in 2000.

------------------------------------------
Change in violent victimization, by
category  1999-2000

The figure shows the estimated annual
percentage change in victimization rates
from 1999 to 2000 for the categories that
comprise violent crime:  homicide, rape
and sexual assault, aggravated assault,
simple assault, and robbery.  

The crime categories are displayed vertically 
according to their 2000 rates per 1,000 
population age 12 or older.  Total violent 
(the sum of all types) is first with the 
highest rate, and murder is last with
the lowest rate. 

Because the National Crime Victimization 
Survey relies on a sample of households, 
the rates and numbers from it are estimates 
and are not exact.  Each horizontal bar 
shows the range within which the true percent 
change in rates from year to year is likely 
to fall.  

If a bar is clear of the "No change" line,
one may be reasonably certain a change
occurred.  If a bar crosses the "No
change" line, there is a possibility that
there was no change.  The degree of
certainty depends on where the bar
crosses the line.  A line shadows the
bottom and a side of those bars
representing crime categories in which a
statistically significant year-to-year
change occurred. 

Bar lengths vary from crime to crime,
dependent upon a variety of factors such
as  sample size and rarity  of the event. 
Because homicide rates are derived from
nonsample data,  the preliminary value for
the 1999-2000 homicide rate change is
given as a point estimate and not as a
range of estimates.  Murder rates have no
variance associated with their point
estimates, though some discrepancies
exist between UCR rates and Vital
Statistics of the National Center for Health
Statistics.

At 42 violent victimizations per 1,000
persons, divorced or separated persons
experienced a fifth less violence than a
year earlier.  Apparent changes in the

were not significant.

For residents of the West -- historically
associated with the highest victimization
rates -- apparent victimization declines
were not significant.  Persons living in the
Northeast, Midwest, and South were
victims of violent crime at lower rates in
2000 than in 1999.

Urbanites and suburbanites experienced
violent victimization at rates lower in 2000
than in 1999.  Rural residents had no
measurable change in the rate of violent
crime.

Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter
measured by the UCR 

Preliminary UCR estimates for the year
2000 indicate a 1.1% decrease in the number 
of murders in 2000, compared to 1999.  
Estimates also show declines in the number 
of murders occurring in the (-1.5%), West
(-4.5%), and Midwest (-4.4%).  The
number of homicides in the Northeast
increased 5.5%, 1999-2000. 

Property crime

The NCVS includes as property crimes
burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft. 
Between 1999 and 2000, overall property
crime rates fell 10% from 198 to 178
crimes per 1,000 households.  

The decline in overall property crime rates
is explained by significant decreases in
theft, primarily completed theft.  A slight
decline in the rate of motor vehicle theft
was evident.  The rate at which households 
were burglarized in 2000 was similar to the 
1999 rate.   

Property crime rates declined between
1999 and 2000 for several of the
demographic groups.  For every racial
category,  households experienced
property crimes at rates lower in 2000
than in 1999.  Fewer property victimizations 
occurred among non-Hispanic households in 
2000 than in 1999.  No measurable change 
occurred in the rate of property crime for 
Hispanics.

rates at least somewhat lower than those in 
1999.  Households with an annual income 
of less than $7,500 or with an income between 
$25,000 and $34,999 experienced property

Murder in the United States, 2000
     
In 1999 the FBI reported a total of
15,533 murders in the United States.  
To make an estimate for 2000, the number 
of murders reported from January to June
2000 was compared to the same period in
1999.  The estimate yielded a 1.8%
decrease in murder.  Based on this
decrease, the preliminary estimate for 
the entire year 2000 is 15,253 murders.

The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) 
program gathers statistics on murder from 
over 16,000 city, county, and State law 
enforcement agencies. The FBI defines 
murder in its annual Crime in the United 
States as the willful, nonnegligent 
killing of one human being by another.

Murder rates differ based on victim
characteristics, but the relationship
between victim characteristics and
incidence of homicide tends to remain the
same.  Past homicide data suggest that in
general:
     
*  Males account for three-quarters of all 
murder victims.  
*  White and black persons each account 
for about half of all homicide victims.
*  About 1 in 8 people murdered are younger 
than 18 years old. 
*  Firearms are used in about 7 in 10 
murders. 
*  Murder rates tend to be highest in the 
South and lowest in the Northeast.
*  Large cities have higher murder rates than 
small cities and rural areas.

Households in urban and suburban areas
experienced property crime at lower rates
in 2000 compared to 1999.  No measurable 
change in property crime rates was noted 
for households in rural areas, 1999-2000.  

Regardless of whether a household was
owned or rented, property crime occurred
at lower rates in 2000 than in 1999.

Characteristics of violent crime
victims, 2000

While violent crime rates declined
significantly for almost every demographic
group examined, those most vulnerable to
violent victimization in the past -- males,
teens, and blacks, for example --
continued to be the most vulnerable in
2000. 

Gender of victim

Males were victims of overall violent
crime, robbery, total assault, aggravated
assault, and simple assault at rates higher
than females in 2000.  Males experienced
violent crime at rates 42% greater, were
robbed at rates 125% greater, and were
victims of aggravated assault at rates
159% greater than females.  Females
were victims of rape or sexual assault at
rates 21 times those of males during
2000.  

Age of victim

In general the younger the person, the
higher rate of violent victimization,
regardless of the type of violence
considered.  In 2000 persons ages 12-15
and ages 16-19 experienced overall
violence at similar rates, which were at
least somewhat higher than rates of
persons in older categories.  Beginning
with the 20-24 age category, the rate at
which persons were victims of violence
declined significantly as the age category
increased. 

Race of victim

Blacks were violently victimized and robbed 
at rates higher than whites and persons of 
"other races" during 2000.***Footnote 3: In
this report, "other races" and "others" are
defined as Asians, Native Hawaiians, other
Pacific Islanders, Alaska Natives, and
American Indians considered together.***  
Blacks were victims of simple assault at
rates higher than the rates of persons of
"other races."  Blacks were victims of
aggravated assault at rates greater than
those of whites.  Whites were violently
victimized and victims of simple assault at
rates greater than persons of "other
races" in 2000.

Hispanic origin of victim

Non-Hispanics and Hispanics were victims 
of overall violent crime, total assault, 
aggravated assault, and simple assault at 
similar rates during 2000.  The rate of 
rape or sexual assault was greater for 
non-Hispanics than Hispanics, and the
rate of robbery, greater for Hispanics 
than non- Hispanics.  

Household income

In general, the lower the person's annual
household income, the higher the rate of
violent victimization during 2000.  Persons 
in households with annual incomes of less 
than $7,500 annually experienced violence 
at rates significantly greater than persons 
in every other income bracket.

Individuals in households with annual
incomes of $75,000 or more were victims
of violent crime overall and aggravated
assault at rates about a third of the rates
of persons in households making less
than $7,500 a year.
    
Marital status

In 2000 persons who had never married were 
victimized by violent crime at rates greater 
than those of persons with other marital 
statuses.  Persons who had never married 
experienced violence at a rate about 6 times 
that of widowed persons and 4 times that of 
married persons. Divorced or separated 
individuals experienced violence at rates 
higher than those who were married who, in 
turn, had higher victimization rates than 
widowed persons.  

Region

Western and Midwestern residents were
victimized by violent crime at similar rates
in 2000.  Northeastern and Southern residents 
also experienced violent crime at similar rates.  
The violent crime rates of Westerners and 
Midwesterners were significantly greater than 
those of persons in the Northeast and South.  

Residence

Urban residents experienced overall
violence, robbery, total assault, and
simple assault at rates higher than
suburban and rural residents in 2000. 
Suburban residents were robbed at a rate
greater than rural residents.  Suburban
and rural persons sustained overall
violence, total assault, aggravated
assault, and simple assault at rates that
did not differ statistically.  

For rape and sexual assault, urban
residents had higher rates than suburban
residents, and rural residents had had
slightly higher rates than suburban
residents.  

Victim-offender relationship

Fifty-three percent of all victims of violent
crime identified the offender(s) as an
intimate, relative, friend, or acquaintance
in 2000.   Among those who had experienced 
violence, victims of rape or sexual assault 
and victims of simple assault were the most 
likely to report knowing the offender (62% 
and 61%, respectively).  Robbery victims had 
the lowest percentage (28%) of having known
the offender.

Victims identified intimate partners
(current or former spouses, boyfriends, or
girlfriends) as the perpetrator in 10% of
violent crime overall, 17% of rapes and
sexual assaults, and 13% of simple
assaults.  A higher percentage of female
(21%) than male (3%) victims identified an
intimate as the offender.  An intimate
partner committed 18% of the rapes and
sexual assaults and 13% of the
aggravated assaults sustained by
females. 

Females identified friends or acquaintances 
as the offender(s) in a substantial portion 
of the violence that they experienced.  
Thirty-seven percent of overall violent crime 
and 42% of rapes and sexual assaults came at 
the hands of a person the female victim called 
a friend or acquaintance.  Thirty-eight percent 
of female victims of aggravated assault said
the offender(s) was a friend or acquaintance.

About a third of all female victims of
violent crime, as well as a third of female
victims of rape or sexual assault, described 
the offender(s) as a stranger. Among female 
robbery victims, 60% identified the offender 
as a stranger. 

As has been the case historically, males
were more likely than females to be
victimized by strangers.  Fifty-four percent
of male victims of violence stated that the
offender was a stranger.  Seventy-four
percent of male robbery victims identified
the robber as a stranger.  

Male victims knew the perpetrator in about
4 in 10 violent crimes during 2000.  Of
violent crimes sustained by males, a
friend or acquaintance committed 38% of
overall violent crime, 30% of aggravated
assaults, and 45% of simple assaults.   

Weapon use

Most victims of violent crimes except
robbery do not face an armed offender. 
Sixty-seven percent of victims of violent
crimes were victimized by an offender(s)
who was not armed.  Rape and sexual assault 
victims were least likely to face an armed 
offender (6%), and robbery victims were 
most likely to face an armed offender (55%).  
Overall, 8%  of victims of violence faced a 
firearm, 7% faced a knife, and 10% described 
the weapon as something other than a firearm 
or knife.  

The type of weapon present varied depending 
upon the type of violence considered.  For 
example, 3% of victims of rape or sexual 
assault faced an offender armed with a firearm, 
compared to 26% of robbery victims and 6% of
assault victims.  Similarly,  3% of rape/sexual 
assault victims were confronted by an offender 
brandishing a knife, compared to 14% of robbery 
victims and 6% of assault victims. 

Characteristics of property crime
victims, 2000

Race of head of household 

Blacks were victims of all property crimes
-- regardless of the type -- at rates higher
than whites during 2000.  Blacks sustained 
overall property crime, burglary, and theft 
at rates significantly greater than persons 
of "other races."  Blacks and persons of 
"other races" had a motor vehicle stolen at 
similar rates during 2000.

Hispanic origin of head of household 

Regardless of the type of property crime
considered, Hispanic households sustained 
property crime at rates significantly greater 
than non-Hispanic households.  

Annual household income

The relationship between annual household 
income and property crime depended upon the 
crime category.  In general, estimates suggest 
that the higher the annual household income, 
the lower the rates of burglary during 2000.  
In contrast during the same period, the
higher the annual household income, the
higher the rate of theft.  Because of these
counteracting associations between the
categories of property crime, no clear
relationship existed between household
income and overall property crime during
2000.

Region, locality, and home ownership

Western households sustained the highest rate 
and Northeastern households experienced the 
lowest rate of overall property crime during 
2000.  Southern and Midwestern households 
experienced similar rates of property crime 
during this period.  

Urban households were the most vulnerable 
to overall property crime, burglary, motor 
vehicle theft, and theft during 2000.  Suburban 
households experienced motor vehicle theft 
at rates significantly higher than rural 
households. No measurable difference in suburban
and rural rates of burglary, overall property 
crime, and household theft emerged during the 
year 2000.  Property crime occurred at greater 
rates among households residing in rented
property than in those in owned property,
regardless of the type of property crime
considered.  

Reporting to the police
    
Forty-eight percent of all violent
victimizations and 36% of all property
crimes were reported to the police during
2000.  Of the violent crimes in 2000, 56%
of robbery and 57% of aggravated assault
were reported to police.

Of property crimes, motor vehicle theft
continued to be reported at the highest
percentage (80%), and theft at the lowest
(30%).  

Reporting crime to the police over time

The percentage of victimizations reported
to police in 2000 increased significantly
from 1999 levels for several categories of
crime.  The percentages of overall violent
crime, rape and sexual assault, simple
assault, overall property crime, and property 
theft reported to the police increased 
significantly.   Robberies, aggravated 
assaults, personal thefts, motor vehicle 
thefts, and burglaries were reported to the 
police in statistically similar percentages 
in 1999 and 2000.

Between 1993 and 2000 the number and types 
of crimes that had increased reporting 
to the police differed slightly from the 
1999-2000 comparisons.  Simple assault and 
motor vehicle theft were reported in 
significantly higher percentages in 2000 than 
in 1993. Slightly higher percentages of rape/
sexual assault, robbery, and  personal theft 
were reported in 2000 than in 1993.
***Footnote 4: The increase in the percentage
of rapes/sexual assaults reported to the police,
1999-2000, was based on 10 or fewer sample
cases.***  There were no measurable changes in 
the percentages of overall violent crime,
aggravated assault, overall property crime, 
burglary, and theft reported to the police, 
1993-2000.

Reporting and victim characteristics

Violence against females was reported to
police in higher percentages than violence
against males during 2000.

The police were notified about 43% of all
violence experienced by males and  55%
of all violence experienced by females
during 2000.

The gender difference in reporting to police 
existed by varying degrees for victims of 
different races.  A significantly higher 
percentage of violence against white females 
compared to white males was reported.  A 
somewhat higher percentage of violence 
perpetrated against black females compared to 
black males was reported to the police in 
2000. The percent reported did not differ
significantly between males and females
of "other races."  

Considering only males or only females,
the percentage of violent victimizations
reported to the police did not differ
significantly across racial categories or by
the Hispanic origin of the victim.

Victimization trends, 1993-2000

In 1993 the first full year of NCVS data
collected after the redesign was
available.  For this reason, trends
presented in this section use 1993 as
the beginning point.  

The rate of every major violent and
property crime measured in the NCVS --
rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated 
assault, simple assault, burglary theft, 
and motor vehicle theft fell significantly 
between 1993 and 2000.

Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter

A comparison of preliminary FBI data from 
January to June 2000 to the same period in 
1999 shows that the overall number of murders 
in the United States committed during 2000 
declined, continuing a decrease that began 
in 1993. Given the continued decline of 1.8% 
in the number of murders committed during the
first 6 months of 2000, an estimated 61%
decline in the number of U.S. murders is
anticipated, 1993-2000.  
Violent crime

The overall violent crime rate fell 44% from 
50 to 28 victimizations per 1,000 persons 
between 1993 and 2000.  Further significant 
declines were noted in rates of rape/sexual 
assault (down 52%), robbery (down 47%), 
aggravated assault (down 53%), and simple 
assault (down 40%). Rates for attempted rape 
were among those showing the greatest decline,  
71% between 1993 and 2000. 

Personal theft
   
Rates of personal theft (purse snatching
and pocket picking) decreased 48% from 2.3 
personal thefts in 1993 to 1.2 per 1,000 
persons in 2000.

Property crime

From 1993 through 2000, the rate of overall 
property crime fell, as did the rate for each 
major type of property crime examined.  Rates 
of household burglary fell 45%, motor vehicle 
theft fell 55%, and theft fell 43%. 

For all categories of property crime,
attempted motor vehicle theft rates were
among those showing the greatest
decline, 59% between 1993 and 2000.

-------------------------------------------
Trends in violent victimizatin, 1973-2000

Because the National Crime Victimization
Survey relies on a sample of households,
the rates and numbers from it are estimates 
and are not exact.

The figure shows the violent victimization
rate trend line, 1973-2000:  Each vertical
bar shows the range within which the true
victimization rate is likely to fall for the
indicated year.  The white trend line
represents the best estimate -- the most
likely value for the rate in each year --
which is the published estimates.  There is
a greater likelihood that the true rate will
fall near the best estimate, and the bars
reflect that likelihood:  The darker the bar
segment, the greater the likelihood.

The precision of estimates derived from
samples is related to the sample size.  In
general,  the larger the sample, the more
precise the estimate and smaller the
range bars.  Some year-to-year changes
are so large that contiguous bars do not
touch (1980-81, 1982-83, 1990-91, 1994-95, 
1995-96, and 1999-2000), suggesting a change  
in the year-to-year victimization rate. In 
other words, the difference is statistically 
significant. Overlap in the bars (1973-76 and
1986-90) suggests that the year-to-year
differences in victimization estimates are
too small to conclude a change in victimization 
rates occurred. 

Even with the range of possible
victimization rates, general trends 
are apparent.  Violent crime rates in- 
creased from the early 1970's to the 
early 1980's, then fell until the mid-
1980's.  For several years in the late 
1980's, violent crime rates were stable, 
but increased in the early 1990's and 
fell 1994-2000.

see the BJS Technical Report Displaying
Violent Crime Trends Using Estimates
from the National Crime Victimization
Survey, March 1998, NCJ 167881. 
----------------------------------------

Characteristics of victims

With few exceptions, persons in most
demographic categories -- gender, race,
Hispanic origin, household income, and
locality -- experienced significant
decreases in violent victimization,
1993-2000.  The rate of violent
victimization for each group fell
significantly, with two exceptions. 
Violence against persons of "other
races" demonstrated no measurable
change, and violence against persons
with annual household incomes of
$75,000 or more fell slightly, 1993-
2000.  

Among groups examined, the largest
decrease in the rate of violent crime
occurred among Hispanic persons.  As
measured by the linear trend test, between 
1993 and 2000, Hispanics experienced 
5.7 fewer violent crimes (per 1,000 
Hispanics) each year.  Males experienced 
nearly the same magnitude of decrease of 
4.6 violent crimes (per 1,000 males) each 
year, 1993-2000.

Between 1993 and 2000 the rate at which
all property crimes were committed in the
United States fell regardless of the
demographic group considered.  Among groups 
considered, the greatest decline in property 
crime rates, as measured by a linear trend 
test, was among Hispanic households.  
Those households experienced 34.9 fewer 
property crimes per 1,000 Hispanic 
households on average each year in the 
period.

Survey methodology      
                   
This Bulletin presents data on non- lethal
violence and property crimes from the
National Crime Victimization Survey, and
data on homicide from the FBI's Uniform
Crime Reporting program.  The NCVS
collects data on nonfatal crimes against
persons age 12 or older, reported and not
reported to the police, from a nationally
representative sample of households in
the United States.  The NCVS provides
information about victims (age, gender,
race, ethnicity, marital status, income and
educational level), offenders (gender,
race, approximate age, and victim-offender 
relations), and criminal offenses (time 
and place of occurrence, use of weapons, 
nature of injury, and economic consequences).

In 2000, 86,800 households and 159,420
people age 12 or older were interviewed. 
For the 2000 NCVS data presented here,
the response rate is 93.4% of eligible
households and 89.6% of eligible
individuals.  

The estimates in this Bulletin were
calculated from data collected during the
calendar year being estimated.   That is,
the data include victimizations that are
identified in interviews conducted in 2000. 
Because of the retrospective nature of the
survey, the estimates include some
incidents that actually occurred during the
previous year.  Analyses comparing the
victimization data collected in a calendar
year to data occurring in a calendar year
the victimization occurred (a data year)
show small differences in estimates.   For
example, the 1995 violent crime rate was
44.5 (per 1,000) using data year data,
compared to 46.6 using calendar year
data.  Differences in estimates obtained
from data year and calendar year
methods are greater during periods of
changing rates and less during periods of
stable rates.

Standard error computations

Comparisons of estimates discussed in
this Bulletin were tested to determine if
the differences were statistically
significant.  Differences described as
higher, lower, or different passed a
hypothesis test at the .05 level of
statistical significance (95% confidence
level).  That is, the tested difference was
greater than twice the standard error of
that difference.  For comparisons of
estimates which were statistically
significant at the 0.10 level (90%
confidence level), differences are
described as somewhat, marginal, or
slight.  

Caution is required when making
comparisons of estimates not explicitly
discussed in the Bulletin.  What may
appear to be a large difference in
estimates may not test as statistically
significant at the 95%- or even the
90%-confidence level.  Significance
testing calculations were conducted at
BJS using statistical programs
developed specifically for the NCVS by
the U.S. Census Bureau.  These
programs consider the complex NCVS
sample design when calculating
generalized variance estimates. 

Testing trends and annual differences in
violent and property victimization

When a statement is made describing
differences in estimates between two
years, it was tested for significance using
a computer program designed specifically
for the NCVS.  These tests determine
whether an estimate in one year differs
from that of another, regardless of
intervening estimate variation.  For
instance, the percent changes in
victimization rates in table 8 were based
on such a test. 

When a statement is made describing the
increase or decrease of a linear trend, it
was tested using a linear trend test. This
test compares the slope of the trend to a
horizontal line (a slope of zero).  The
purpose of this test is to  ascertain
whether the slope generated from a
change in estimates differs from a flat
trend - taking into account estimate
variation in intervening years.  The linear 
trend test is a regression equation using 
time as the independent variable, and the 
estimate of victimization as the dependent 
variable.  A regression coefficient (b) 
and its corresponding standard error (F) 
are computed.  Next a t-statistic -- the 
ratio b/F -- is calculated.  If the t-
statistic is greater than 1.96 for a two-
tailed test, the slope is different from
zero, and if the t-statistic is greater than
1.645 for a two-tailed test, the slope is
slightly different from zero.  If the t-
statistic is less than the critical value, 
the trend of the estimates does not differ 
significantly from a flat line.  

This Bulletin uses linear trend tests in 
Characteristics of victims on page 13 and
Reporting to the police on page 10.  In
NCVS Bulletins published prior to 1999,
linear trend tests were not used.
