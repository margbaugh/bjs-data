An estimated 10,400 American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) inmates were 
held in local jails at midyear 2014, up from an estimated 5,500 at 
midyear 1999 (figure 1, table 1). *** Footnote 1 Based on a single race 
and excludes persons of Hispanic or Latino origin. See Reporting of race 
and Hispanic origin data text box on page 8.*** At midyear 2014, AIAN 
inmates accounted for 1.4% of all (744,600) local jail inmates (figure 2). 
The percentage of AIAN inmates held in local jails remained stable 
from 2006 to 2014. 

Data in this report are from the Census of Jails (1999 and 2013), Census 
of Jail Inmates (2005), and Annual Survey of Jails (2000-2014). The 
report also uses data from the National Inmate Survey (2011-12) to 
examine the characteristics of adult AIAN inmates held in local jails. 
The report provides state and national level estimates and examines jail 
inmates by race and Hispanic origin.

HIGHLIGHTS
*************

* At midyear 2014, an estimated 10,400 American Indian and Alaska Native 
(AIAN) inmates were held in local jails, nearly double the number held in 
1999 (5,500).

* From 1999 to 2014, the number of AIAN jail inmates increased by an 
average of 4.3% per year, compared to an increase of 1.4% per year for 
all other races combined.

* Between 1999 and 2013, the AIAN jail incarceration rate increased from 
288 to 398 AIAN inmates per 100,000 AIAN U.S. residents.

* An estimated 71% of adult AIAN jail inmates were age 39 or younger. 

* Nearly a quarter (24%) of AIAN jail inmates were held for a violent 
offense.

* AIAN jail inmates were equally as likely as adult inmates of other 
races and Hispanic origin to be held for a violent sexual offense (about 
5% each).

* About 12% of the adult AIAN jail population were drug offenders, which 
was significantly lower than adult jail inmates of other races and 
Hispanic origin (24%).
***********************************************************

Local jail facilities include confinement facilities administered by 
local or regional law enforcement agencies and private facilities 
operated under contract to such agencies. They exclude jails administered 
by federal, state prison, or tribal authorities. This analysis includes 
15 locally operated jails in Alaska, but excludes the combined jails and 
prison systems in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, 
and Vermont. In addition to the 10,400 AIAN inmates held in local jails, 
21,600 were held in state and federal prisons in 2014. (See the text box 
More than 34,000 American Indian and Alaska Natives were held in local 
jails and in state and federal prisons in 2014.)

******************************************
The number of AIANs held in local jails 
nearly doubled from 1999 to 2014
******************************************

While AIAN inmates made up a small proportion of the jail population, the 
number of AIAN inmates held in county and city jails increased nearly 90% 
from 1999 to 2014. Non-Hispanic white inmates accounted for 47% of the 
jail population in 2014, up from 41% in 1999.***Footnote 2 See Jail 
Inmates in 2015, NCJ 250394, BJS web, December 2016.*** In comparison, 
the percentage of non-Hispanic black inmates held in local jails declined 
from 42% in 1999 to 35% in 2014. Hispanics accounted for 15% of the jail 
population, which was unchanged from 1999 to 2014.

From midyear 1999 to midyear 2014, the number of AIAN inmates held in 
local jails grew by an average of 4.3% each year, compared to an increase 
of 1.4% per year for all other races and Hispanic origin combined. The 
average annual growth of AIAN inmates from 1999 to 2005 was 5.5% and 5.4% 
from 2005 to 2010. In comparison, the number of jail inmates of all other 
races and Hispanic origin grew an average of 3.5% each year from 1999 to 
2005, and remained stable from midyear 2005 to midyear 2014.

******************************************
The majority of AIAN jail inmates were 
held in the Midwest and West
******************************************

AIAN inmates made up 0.2% of all inmates in the Northeast, 0.4% in the 
South, 2.1% in the Midwest, and 3.0% in the West on December 31, 2013 
(the latest year for which state-level data were available) (not shown). 
AIAN inmates were held in local jails in nearly every state on December 
31, 2013. About 80% of these inmates were held in jurisdictions located 
in the Midwest and West in 1999, 2005, and 2013 (figure 3, table 2).
 
From 1999 to 2013, jails in Arizona reported the largest increase in the 
percentage of AIANs held in local jails, from 8% of the Arizona jail 
population in 1999 to 11% by yearend 2013. In comparison, jails in 
California reported the largest decline in percentages, from 9% in 1999 
to 6% by yearend 2013.

Based on the absolute jail population at yearend 2013, New Mexico jails 
held the greatest number of AIAN inmates (1,180), followed by jails in 
seven states that held at least 500 AIAN inmates: Arizona (970), Oklahoma 
(850), South Dakota (670), Washington (620), California (550), Wisconsin 
(540), and Minnesota (500). Eight states held fewer than 10 AIAN inmates 
at yearend 2013: Massachusetts (9), Mississippi (9), Ohio (7), New 
Hampshire (6), Georgia (6), West Virginia (3), and Alabama (1). The 
District of Columbia reported holding no AIAN inmates at yearend 2013.

******************************************
About 22% of jails held at least 
one AIAN inmate
******************************************

Approximately 700 local jail facilities (22% of all local jails 
nationwide) held at least one AIAN inmate on December 31, 2013 (figure 
4). Ten facilities held more than 100 AIAN inmates at yearend (ranging 
from 124 to 353 inmates). In 4 of these 10 facilities, AIAN inmates made 
up more than 50% of their total population. In 2 of these 10 facilities, 
AIAN inmates made up less than 10% of their total inmate population. 
Three of these 10 facilities held about 10% of all AIAN inmates held in 
the 700 local jail facilities: San Juan County Adult Detention Center, 
New Mexico (353); Maricopa County Jail System, Arizona (324); and 
Pennington County Jail, South Dakota (262).

Of the approximately 700 facilities holding at least one AIAN inmate on 
December 31, 2013, 4 facilities reported that AIANs made up all of their 
inmate population (each of these facilities reported holding fewer than 
10 inmates), 40 facilities reported that AIANs made up at least half of 
their inmate population, and 64 facilities reported AIANs made up at 
least a third of their inmate population. In comparison, 216 facilities 
reported that AIAN inmates made up less than 1% of their inmate 
population.

******************************************
A small number of inmates were held 
for tribal authorities
******************************************

Fifty-three local jail facilities held approximately 540 inmates for 
tribal authorities on December 31, 2013. Of these, 25 facilities held 
about 325 inmates for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), and 28 
facilities held about 215 inmates for AIAN tribal governments.***Footnote 
3 Inmates held for the BIA and tribal governments were typically AIAN.*** The 540 inmates held on behalf of tribal authorities made up a 
small portion of both the 731,600 inmates held on December 31, 2013, and 
the estimated 109,000 inmates held in local jails for all authorities 
(including federal, state, and tribal authorities).

******************************************
The AIAN jail incarceration rate 
continued to increase
******************************************

At yearend 2013, local jails in the United States incarcerated 237 
persons per 100,000 residents of all ages and races and Hispanic 
ethnicity. This was a slight increase from 1999 (228 per 100,000), but a 
decline from 259 persons per 100,000 residents in 2005 (table 3). For 
AIANs (single race, not of Hispanic or Latino origin), the jail 
incarceration rate in 2013 (398 per 100,000 AIAN U.S. residents) was 
higher than the national rate. ***Footnote 4 Based on a single race and 
excludes persons of Hispanic or Latino origin.*** Though the national 
incarceration rate decreased from 2005 to 2013, the AIAN incarceration 
rate increased from 359 in 2005 to 398 in 2013. While AIANs in the U.S. 
resident population grew 16% from 1999 to 2013, the number of AIANs held 
in local jails increased 60%, which resulted in the higher incarceration 
rate in 2013.

Wisconsin had the highest AIAN jail incarceration rate in 2013. From 1999 
to 2013, its rate increased 25%, from 870 to 1,085 per 100,000 AIAN 
Wisconsin residents. The number of AIAN inmates held in Wisconsin jails 
increased 42% (160 inmates) during the same period, while its AIAN 
resident population increased by 15%. At yearend 2013, five other states 
had an AIAN jail incarceration rate of at least 900 per 100,000 residents 
of all ages: Utah (1,079 per 100,000), Wyoming (1,040), Nebraska, (977), 
South Dakota (944), and North Dakota (912). From 1999 to 2013, Utah's 
incarceration rate increased 104%, from 529 to 1,079. The number of AIAN 
inmates held in Utah jails increased 114% (up 160 inmates) during the 
same period, while its AIAN resident population increased by 7%. From 
1999 to 2013, Wyoming's incarceration rate increased 33%, from 780 to 
1,040. The number of AIAN inmates held in Wyoming jails increased 63% (up 
50 inmates) during the same period, while its AIAN resident population 
increased by 23%. In all, 13 states had a higher AIAN incarceration rate 
than the national AIAN jail incarceration rate (398 per 100,000).

From 1999 to 2013, of the 31 states whose AIAN jail incarceration rate 
increased, 22 states also experienced an increase in the incarceration 
rate among inmates of Hispanic origin and all other races other than 
AIAN. Among the 13 states that had a decrease in the AIAN jail 
incarceration rate, eight experienced an increase in the jail 
incarceration rate among inmates of Hispanic origin and all other races 
other than AIAN.

At yearend 2013, jails in the Midwest (618 per 100,000 AIAN Midwest 
residents) and West (506) had a higher AIAN jail incarceration rate than 
the national AIAN jail incarceration rate (figure 5). A similar increase 
was observed in the Midwest from 1999 (429 AIANs per 100,000 residents) 
to 2005 (522) and in the West from 1999 (352) to 2005 (438). Jails in the 
South and Northeast both experienced increases in AIAN incarceration 
rates between 1999 and 2005. The incarceration rate for AIANs in Southern 
states was flat between 2005 and yearend 2013 (185 per 100,000 in 2013), 
while jails in the Northeast had lower incarceration rates in 2013 (178 
per 100,000).

********************************************
An estimated 71% of adult AIAN jail inmates 
were age 39 or younger in 2011
********************************************

Males made up 80% of adult AIAN jail inmates (single race, not of 
Hispanic or Latino origin) in 2011, the most recent year for which 
detailed survey data are available (table 4). Females accounted for 20% 
of adult AIAN inmates. The proportions of both AIAN males and females 
were significantly different than the distribution of male (87%) and 
female (13%) inmates for all other races and Hispanic origin. An 
estimated 71% of adult AIAN jail inmates were age 39 or younger. Young 
adults (ages 18 to 24) accounted for about 20% of all adult AIAN inmates, 
and 5% of AIAN inmates were age 55 or older. Except for inmates ages 18 
to 24, the age distribution of adult AIAN jail inmates was not 
significantly different from all other races and Hispanic origin 
combined.

In 2011, nearly a quarter (24%) of the AIAN jail inmates were held for a 
violent offense, including 5% for a violent sexual offense. AIAN jail 
inmates were equally as likely as adult jail inmates of all other races 
and Hispanic origin to be held for violent sexual offense. Drug offenders 
accounted for 12% of the adult AIAN jail population, which was 
significantly lower than all other inmates (24%). However, AIAN jail 
inmates were more likely (14%) than all other inmates (6%) to be held for 
a DWI/DUI of alcohol or drugs. The distribution of inmates held for an 
other public order offense (about 1 in 10) was the same for AIAN inmates 
and inmates of all other races and Hispanic origin.

***********************************************************************
********************************************
Reporting of race and Hispanic origin data
********************************************

For this report, the inmate count of American Indian and Alaska Natives 
(AIAN) was based on race and Hispanic origin and not on tribal 
membership. Except for table 5, the AIAN jail population was based on a 
single race and excludes persons of Hispanic or Latino origin. Table 5 
compares selected characteristics of AIAN jail inmates based on the 
following four race and Hispanic origin categories in the 2011-12 
National Inmate Survey (NIS-3):***Footnote 5 Excluded AIANs of two or 
more races who were of Hispanic or Latino origin. These persons were not 
randomly selected for the NIS-3.***

* AIAN, single race, not Hispanic or Latino origin

* AIAN, two or more races, not Hispanic or Latino origin 

* AIAN, single race, Hispanic or Latino origin

* All AIAN jail inmates, including Hispanic and non-Hispanic 
AIANs and single or multiple race AIANs.
************************************************************************

In 2011, about 8 in 10 adult AIAN jail inmates had been previously 
incarcerated in jail, prison, or other correctional facilities. This was 
higher than all other adult inmates (7 in 10). Adult AIAN jail inmates 
(53%) were also more likely than all other adult inmates (47%) to be 
sentenced for their crime. However, AIAN jail inmates (6%) were less 
likely than all other adult inmates (9%) to be sentenced for 5 years or 
longer. More adult AIAN inmates (16%) than all other adult inmates (10%) 
were serving 30 days to 6 months. Nearly 4 in 10 adult AIAN inmates were 
held in jail for 29 days or fewer since admission, compared to about 3 in 
10 inmates of all other races and Hispanic origin combined.

********************************************
The number of jail inmates reporting partial 
AIAN race was six times greater than persons 
reporting sole AIAN race
********************************************

In 2011, the AIAN adult jail population ranged from an estimated 12,100 
inmates (single race, non-Hispanic or Latino origin) to 68,500 inmates 
(all AIAN jail inmates, including Hispanic and non-Hispanic AIANs and 
AIANs of single or multiple races) (table 5). (See Reporting of race and 
Hispanic origin data text box for race classification detail.) Of the 
estimated 68,500 AIAN adult jail inmates, 12,600 were Hispanic or Latino 
of a single race and 43,800 were non-Hispanic or Latino origin of two or 
more races.

Combined, males made up 84% of all AIAN adult jail inmates, which was 
similar across all the AIAN race and Hispanic origin categories. 
Regardless of the race and Hispanic origin of adult AIAN inmates, nearly 
29% were age 40 or older. In comparison, nearly 4% of single race AIAN 
non-Hispanic inmates were ages 18 to 19. This was significantly smaller 
than non-Hispanics AIANs of two or more races (6%) and Hispanics of 
single race AIAN inmates (7%).

Non-Hispanic AIAN inmates of two or more races were more likely to be 
held for a violent sexual offense (8%) or a drug law violation (22%) than 
single race, non-Hispanic AIAN inmates. Similarly, Hispanic single race 
AIAN inmates were more likely to be held for a drug law violation (17%). 
Combined, 9% of all AIAN adult jail inmates were held for a public order 
offense, 18% were held for a violent offense other than sexual violence, 
and 26% were held in jail for a property crime.

About half (51%) of all AIAN inmates were unsentenced, 4% were serving 
less than 30 days, and 34% were serving 6 months or more. Non-Hispanic 
AIAN inmates of a single race were more likely to serve 30 days to 6 
months (16%) than non-Hispanic AIAN inmates of two or more races and 
Hispanic AIAN inmates of a single race (10% each).

*************************************************************
More than 34,000 American Indian and Alaska Natives were 
held in local jails and in state and federal prisons in 2014
*************************************************************

The number of American Indian and Alaska Natives (AIAN) (single race, not 
of Hispanic or Latino origin) incarcerated in jail or prison reached an 
estimated 34,400 in 2014, up 72% from 20,000 in 1999 (table 6). In 2014, 
nearly two-thirds (21,600) were held in state (17,900) and federal 
(3,700) prison. The remaining 12,780 AIANs were held in local jails 
(10,400) and Indian country jails (2,380). Some AIAN inmates held in 
local jails may have been adjudicated by a tribal criminal justice system 
and housed in jails under contracts with tribal, city, or county 
governments.

From 1999 to 2014, the number of AIAN inmates held in jails and prisons 
nationwide grew by an annual average of about 3.7%. The largest average 
annual growth was observed in federal prisons (up 5.2%), followed by 
local jails (up 4.3%), state prisons (up 3.2%), and Indian country jails 
(up 2.6%). The AIAN population in federal prison more than doubled (up 
113%) from 1,740 in 1999 to about 3,700 in 2014. The number of AIAN 
inmates held in local jails increased nearly 90% from 1999 to 2014, 
compared to state prisons (up 61%) and Indian country jails (up 47%).

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 2.3 million non-Hispanic 
AIANs lived in the United States in 2014, up from 2 million in 1999.
***Footnote 6 Includes race alone and excludes Hispanic or Latino 
origin.*** The AIAN population accounted for less than 1% of the U.S. 
resident population. The number of AIANs held in U.S. jails or prisons 
accounted for 1% of all inmates held in jail or prison in 1999 and 1.6% 
in 2014. 

The incarceration rate for AIANs was higher than the overall national 
incarceration rate. In 2014, federal, state, local, and tribal 
correctional facilities held about 1,460 AIAN inmates per 100,000 AIAN 
U.S. residents, up 50% from a rate of about 980 per 100,000 AIAN in 1999 
(not shown). The incarceration rate among inmates of Hispanic origin and 
all other races other than AIAN remained relatively stable from 1999 
(690) to 2014 (680). While the general population increased at similar 
rates (16% for AIAN and 17% for all other races and Hispanic origin), the 
number of AIANs incarcerated in jail and prison increased 72% from 1999 
to 2014, compared to 15% among inmates of Hispanic origin and all other 
races combined.

Methodology
*************

Census of Jails
*******************

The Bureau of Justice Statistics' (BJS) Census of Jails is part of a 
series of data collections that describes the nation’s local jail inmates 
and facility characteristics and is a complete enumeration of the more 
than 3,100 local jails in the United States. Because the census is a 
complete enumeration, the results are not subject to sampling error. 
The census supplies the sampling frame for BJS's Annual Survey of Jails, 
the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, and the National Inmate Survey.

Data from Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities that function as 
jails are included in the census. Locally operated jails in Alaska, which 
hold inmates beyond arraignment and are staffed by municipal or county 
employees, are included in the census. Local jails are intended for 
adults but sometimes hold juveniles. The census excludes temporary 
holding facilities, such as drunk tanks and police lockups, that do not 
hold persons after they are formally charged in court (usually within 72 
hours of arrest). The census also excludes state-operated facilities in 
Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which 
have combined jail-prison systems, and are counted in BJS's prison 
collections.

The Census of Jails collects facility-level information on the--

* number of confined inmates and persons under the supervision of jail 
authorities but not confined in jail

* number of inmates participating in weekend programs

* number of confined non-U.S. citizens

* number of confined inmates by sex and adult or juvenile status

* number of juveniles held as adults conviction and sentencing status 
offense type

* number of inmates held by race or Hispanic origin

* number of inmates held for other jurisdictions or authorities

* average daily population

* rated capacity

* number of admissions and releases

* program participation for nonconfined inmates

* operating expenditures

* staff by occupational category and race or Hispanic origin.

2013 Census of Jails
***********************

The 2013 census included all locally administered confinement facilities 
(3,163) under the authority of 2,872 local jurisdictions. However, the 
results were affected by unit and item nonresponse. The unit-level 
response rate for the census was 92.4%. Missing item-level response was 
1% for the inmate population and 5% for inmate race or Hispanic origin. 
Detailed information on the 2013 Census of Jails methodology, survey 
nonresponse, imputation, and weighting procedures is available in Census 
of Jails: Population Changes, 1999–2013 (NCJ 248627, BJS web, December 
2015). For this report, BJS re-estimated the race data for 18 facilities 
that imputation procedures erroneously inflated the American Indian and 
Alaska Native inmate population. For these 18 facilities, BJS applied the 
racial distribution reported in the most recent Annual Survey of Jails or 
Census of Jails closest to the 2013 census to the total confined inmate 
population reported in the 2013 Census of Jails.

2005 Census of Jail Inmates
******************************

The 2005 Census of Jail Inmates included all locally administered 
confinement facilities under the authority of 2,853 local jurisdictions, 
42 privately operated jails under contract for local governments, and 65 
multi-jurisdiction jails administered by two or more local governments. 
Thirteen facilities maintained by the BOP and functioning as jails were 
included in the census but excluded from the report. All jail 
jurisdictions responded to the census, resulting in a 100% response rate. 
Missing item-level response for inmate race or Hispanic origin was 5%. 
For this report, to provide national and state estimates of race, BJS 
estimated race data for 139 facilities that reported their total confined 
inmate population, but not race data. For 40 facilities, BJS applied the 
racial distribution reported in the most recent Annual Survey of Jails or 
Census of Jails closest to the 2005 census to the total confined inmate 
population reported in the 2005 Census of Jail Inmates. For 99 facilities 
that did not report race breakout in a recent data collection, BJS summed 
the reported and estimated (40 facilities) item values and then 
multiplied them by a nonresponse adjustment factor (NAF). The NAF was 
calculated as a ratio of the total number of inmates in all jails by 
state to the number of inmates in jails by state reported and estimated 
race data. For additional methodology information, see Prison and Jail 
Inmates at Midyear 2005 (NCJ 213133, BJS web, May 2006).

1999 Census of Jails
***********************

The 1999 Census of Jails included all locally administered confinement 
facilities under the authority of 3,084 local jurisdictions. Of these 
jurisdictions in the final universe, 251 provided information on critical 
data items only. Data from six jurisdictions that did not respond to any 
items on the questionnaire were imputed based on previous survey and 
census reports. Missing item-level response for inmate race or Hispanic 
origin was 14%. For this report, to provide national and state total 
estimates of race, BJS estimated race data for 370 facilities that 
reported their total confined inmate population, but not race data. For 
306 facilities, BJS applied the racial distribution reported in the most 
recent Annual Survey of Jails or Census of Jails closest to the 1999 
census to the total confined inmate population reported in the 1999 
Census of Jail Inmates. For 64 facilities that did not report race 
breakout in a recent data collection, BJS summed the reported and 
estimated (306 facilities) item values and then multiplied them by a NAF. 
The NAF was calculated as a ratio of the total number of inmates in all 
jails by state to the number of inmates in jails by state reported and 
estimated race data. For additional methodology information, see Census 
of Jails, 1999 (NCJ 186633, BJS web, August 2001).

Annual Survey of Jails
************************

The ASJ is a sample survey that provides an annual source of aggregate 
data on local jails and jail inmates. The survey estimates 
characteristics of the nation’s jails and inmates housed in these jails. 
Data are collected on admissions and releases, number and percentage 
changes of jail jurisdictions, rated capacities and levels of occupancy, 
population supervised in the community, methods of community supervision, 
and crowding issues. The ASJ captures aggregated counts by race and sex, 
but not race by sex of inmate. The number of American Indians and Alaska 
Natives held in local jails excludes persons of Hispanic origin. Detailed 
information on the 2007 through 2014 ASJ methodology, including the 
survey nonresponse, imputation, and weighting procedures is available in 
the Jail Inmates at Midyear series. For 2000 and 2006 information, see 
Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 2000 (NCJ 185989, BJS web, March 2001) 
and Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 2006 (NCJ 217675, BJS web, June 
2007).

National Inmate Survey 
**************************

The report uses data from the 2011-12 National Inmate Survey (NIS-3) to 
examine the characteristics of adult AIAN inmates held in local jails. 
The NIS-3 is part of BJS's National Prison Rape Statistics Program, which 
collects reports of sexual victimization from administrative records and 
allegations of sexual victimization directly from victims through surveys 
of inmates in prisons and jails. BJS implemented this program to meet the 
requirements of the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-79). 
The inmate surveys contain a wide range of data beyond measures of sexual 
victimization, including items useful for describing inmates held in the 
state and federal prisons and local jails and their confinement 
experiences.

BJS conducted NIS-3 in 233 state and federal prisons, 358 jails, and 15 
special facilities (military, Indian country, and Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE)) between February 2011 and May 2012. The NIS-3 
comprised two questionnaires—a survey of sexual victimization and a 
survey of mental and physical health, past drug and alcohol use, and 
treatment for substance abuse. Inmates were randomly assigned to receive 
one of the questionnaires, and the content of the survey remained unknown 
to facility staff and the interviewers at the time of the interview.

A total of 106,532 inmates participated in NIS-3. Combined, the 
victimization survey and the randomly assigned companion survey included 
43,721 inmates in state and federal prisons, 61,351 inmates in jails, 605 
inmates in military facilities, 192 inmates in Indian country jails, and 
663 inmates in facilities operated by ICE.

Selection of jail facilities
******************************

In designing NIS-3, BJS selected a sample of 393 jails to represent the 
2,957 jail facilities identified in the Census of Jail Inmates, 2005, and 
supplemented the sample with information obtained during the NIS-1 and 
NIS-2. The 2005 census was a complete enumeration of all jail 
jurisdictions, including all publicly operated and privately operated 
facilities under contract to jail authorities. The NIS-3 was restricted 
to jails that had six or more inmates on June 30, 2005. Jails identified 
as closed or ineligible during the NIS-1 and NIS-2 were removed from the 
NIS-3 frame. Based on estimates from the 2011 ASJ, jails in the NIS-3 
held an estimated 720,171 inmates age 18 or older and 5,700 inmates ages 
16 to 17 on June 30, 2011. 

Selection of inmates within jails
************************************

For NIS-3, BJS obtained a roster of inmates immediately prior to the 
start of data collection at each facility. Inmates age 15 or younger and 
inmates who had not been arraigned were removed from the roster. Eligible 
inmates within a facility were placed into one of two stratum based on 
their age. Inmates who were ages 16 to 17 (juveniles) were placed in one 
stratum and inmates age 18 or older (adults) were placed in the other. 
Inmates age 15 or younger were considered ineligible for the NIS-3.
Selection of adult inmates within jails
The number of adult inmates sampled in each facility varied based on six 
criteria:

* an expected 3% sexual victimization prevalence rate

* a desired level of precision based on a standard error of 1.4%

* a projected 65% response rate among selected inmates

* a 10% chance among participating inmates of not receiving the sexual 
victimization questionnaire

* an adjustment factor of 1.9 to account for the complex survey design

* a pre-arraignment adjustment factor equal to 1 in facilities
where the status was known for all inmates and less than 1 in
facilities where only the overall proportion of inmates who
were pre-arraigned was known.

Each eligible adult inmate was assigned a random number
and sorted in ascending order. Inmates were selected from
the list up to the expected number of inmates determined
by the sampling criteria. Due to the dynamic nature of jail
populations, a second roster of inmates was obtained on the
first day of data collection. Eligible adult inmates who appeared
on the second roster but who had not appeared on the initial
roster were identified. These inmates had been arraigned since
the initial roster was created or were newly admitted to the
facility and arraigned. A random sample of the new inmates
was chosen using the same probability of selection used to
sample from the first roster.


Methods for adjusting for survey nonresponse and coverage error are 
described in detail in Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails as 
Reported by Inmates, 2011–12 (NCJ 241399, BJS web, May 2013).

Survey of Jails in Indian Country
************************************

The annual Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) provides a source of 
data on Indian country jails and jail inmates, including counts, 
movements, facility operations, and staff. In selected years (1998, 2004, 
2007, and 2011), additional information was collected on facility 
programs and services, such as medical assessments and mental health 
screening procedures, inmate work assignments, counseling, and 
educational programs.

The enumeration includes all Indian country correctional facilities 
operated by tribal authorities or the Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. 
Department of the Interior, to describe adult and juvenile jail 
facilities and detention centers in Indian country. For this report, 
Indian country included reservations, pueblos, rancherias, and other 
appropriate areas (18 U.S.C. § 1151). The number of Indian country jail 
facilities increased from 68 at midyear 1999 to 79 facilities at midyear 
2014. Detailed information on the 1999-2014 SJIC methodology, survey 
nonresponse, and procedures is available in the Jails in Indian Country 
series on the BJS website.

National Prisoner Statistics program
**************************************

The National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) program collects annual data on 
prisoners at yearend. Prior to 2011, the NPS gathered custody population 
by race at midyear. BJS depends entirely on voluntary participation of 
state departments of corrections and BOP for NPS data.

The NPS distinguishes between inmates in custody and prisoners under 
jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a state or the BOP must hold 
that inmate in one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction over a 
prisoner, the state or BOP must have legal authority over that prisoner, 
regardless of where the prisoner is incarcerated or supervised. Some 
states were unable to provide counts that distinguish between custody and 
jurisdiction.

The NPS jurisdiction counts include persons held in prisons, 
penitentiaries, correctional facilities, halfway houses, boot camps, 
farms, training or treatment centers, and hospitals. Counts also include 
prisoners who were temporarily absent (less than 30 days), in court, or 
on work release; housed in privately operated facilities, local jails, or 
other state or federal facilities; and serving concurrent sentences for 
more than one correctional authority.

For table 6, the 1999 and 2005 state and federal prison data are based on 
the custody population at midyear, and the 2014 data are based on the 
yearend custody population. For this report, the state and federal 
custody prison population for 2014 is estimated based on the ratio of the 
custody count to the jurisdiction count from the 2010 NPS, and applied to 
the 2014 jurisdiction population by race. Detailed information on the 
1999-2014 NPS methodology, the survey nonresponse, and procedures is 
available in the Prisoners series and Prison and Jail Inmates series, 
which are both on the BJS website.

Additional notes for figures
********************************
 
Data for figures 1-5 exclude jails in Indian country; the federal 
jurisdiction; and combined jail and prison systems in Alaska, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Figures include 
15 locally operated jails in Alaska. Data are adjusted for survey and 
item nonresponse. The number of American Indians and Alaska Natives held 
in local jails excludes persons of Hispanic origin. Unless noted for a 
specific year, data are based on the number of inmates held on the last 
weekday in June.


******************************************************************
The Bureau of Justice Statistics of the U.S. Department of Justice is the 
principal federal agency responsible for measuring crime, criminal 
victimization, criminal offenders, victims of crime, correlates of crime, 
and the operation of criminal and civil justice systems at the federal, 
state, tribal, and local levels. BJS collects, analyzes, and disseminates 
reliable and valid statistics on crime and justice systems in the United 
States, supports improvements to state and local criminal justice 
information systems, and participates with national and international 
organizations to develop and recommend national standards for justice 
statistics. Jeri M. Mulrow is acting director.
