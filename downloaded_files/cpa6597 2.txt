The International Year of Older Persons

The General Assembly of the United Nations observed the year 
1999 as the International Year of Older Persons "in recognition 
of humanity's demographic coming of age and the promise it holds 
for maturing attitudes and capabilities in social, economic, 
cultural and spiritual undertakings...."(Resolution 47/5)

The year's theme was "Towards a Society for All Ages."   "A 
society for all ages is one that does not caricature older persons 
as patients and pensioners.  Instead, it sees them 
as both agents and beneficiaries of development." -- Kofi Annan, 
Secretary-General of the United Nations, October 1, 1998

The Bureau of Justice Statistics presents this comprehensive report 
about criminal victimization of persons age 65 or older 
in the context of a society with appropriate concerns 
for all age groups.

Highlights

The elderly, persons age 65 or older, experienced less violence
and fewer property crimes than younger persons

Figure:  On average, 1992-97, for every 1,000 persons at their
age level, persons age 65 or older experienced about 5 violent
crimes and those younger than age 25 experienced over 100

Between 1992 and 1997 the average population of persons age 65
or older was 31.3 million.  These elderly were victims of 2.7
million property and violent crimes, either completed or
attempted--

2.5 million property crimes -- (household burglary, motor
vehicle theft, and household theft)

-- 46,000 purse snatchings or pocket pickings

-- 165,000  nonlethal violent crimes (rape, robbery, and
aggravated and simple assault)

-- 1,000 murders

(These annual averages describe data aggregated across the 6
years, providing a large enough number of cases for more
detailed analyses. See Methodology for further explanation.)     

When compared with other age groups, the elderly were
disproportionately affected by property crimes. More than 9 in
10 crimes against the elderly were property crimes, compared to
fewer than 4 in 10 crimes against persons age 12 to 24.

The elderly made up 15% of the population age 12 or older, but
accounted for 7% of measured crimes.
              
Robbery accounted for a quarter of the violent crimes against
persons age 65 or older, but less than an eighth of the violent
crimes experienced by those age 12-64.
                   
In general, compared with crime incidents involving other age
groups, most crimes against the elderly were more likely to
occur in or near their homes, and to occur in daylight hours.
                   
Differences in lifestyle may account in part for when and where
crimes against the elderly occurred.  For example, victims of
nonlethal violence who said that they never went out at night
for entertainment, work, shopping or other similar activities
included --

-- 22% of victims age 65 or older  
-- About 3% of victims in age groups under 50.

Elderly victims of nonlethal violence were less likely than
younger victims to go out at night.

Compared with violent crime victims in other age groups, elderly
victims of nonlethal violence were less likely to use
self-protective measures, such as arguing with the offender,
running away, calling for help, or attacking the offender.

50-64                  69
65 or older            49

More than 1 in 5 elderly victims of nonlethal violence sustained
injuries. For some crimes, such as overall violence, the elderly
were more likely to report crimes to police than victims in 
other age groups.  In all age groups, however, many crimes were
not reported. 

Figure.  On average from 1992 to 1997, the rate of property
crime for persons age 65 or older was less than a fourth that of
the young (117 crimes per 1,000 elderly households and 480
crimes per 1,000 households of the young)

Measuring crime against persons age 65 or older

"The elderly," a synonym for persons age 65 or older, comprise
over 1 in 8 U.S. residents 

In 1997 persons age 65 or older made up 12.7% of the United
States population.

In 1995 about 4% of persons age 65 or older, or 1.4 million,
resided in nursing homes or other long-term care facilities. 

Persons age 65 or older made up 89% of all persons in nursing
homes in 1995.  Although this age group is disproportionately
represented in the population of this type of institution, other
age groups are disproportionately represented in other types,
such as prisons.  



Households form basis for National Crime Victimization Survey

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) does not
interview members of any type of institutionalized population. 
Crimes occurring in these settings are missed.  In particular,
violence, abuse, neglect, theft, or other victimization of older
persons in nursing homes are not measured through this survey. 

Crimes measured by the NCVS include rape and sexual assault,
robbery, aggravated and simple assault, purse snatching and
pocket picking, household burglary, motor vehicle theft, and
theft from the home or car.  The NCVS does not measure
kidnaping, crimes against businesses, fraud (including
telemarketing scams), and other economic or "white collar"
crimes.

Box.

Household head

The NCVS relies on one person in a household to report the
household crimes of burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft.
The term "household head" designates this person in analyzing
findings about property crime from the NCVS.  The household head
concept is used because the crimes are assumed to be against an
entire household rather than a single victim.

A household head is nearly always an adult, and can be either
male or female.  End of box.

Some experts believe that some economic crimes, such as fraud,
disproportionately impact persons age 65 or older.  The NCVS
does not collect data to support or dispute this observation.

The elderly generally experienced crime at lower rates than
persons in other age categories

Although persons age 65 or older  made up 15% of the population
age 12 or older between 1992 and 1997, they accounted for about
7% of all crime measured by NCVS during that period.

For violent crimes, in particular, the elderly experienced much
lower rates than other age groups.  On average between 1992 and
1997, 5 persons per 1,000, age 65 or older, experienced a
violent crime (including murder, rape or sexual assault,
robbery, or aggravated or simple assault).  For persons ages
50-64, the overall violence rate was 16 per 1,000 persons,
compared with 47 per 1,000 persons ages 25-49 and 105 per 1,000
persons ages 12-24.  Most data in this report are presented as
an annual average of 6 years of surveys because of the
relatively small number of sample cases from a single year. 

The one crime category which affected the elderly at about the
same rate as most others in the population (except those ages
12-24) was personal theft, which includes purse snatching and
pocket picking.

Not only were the elderly victimized less often, but a greater
percentage of victimizations against the elderly, compared to
those against younger persons, were property crimes.  Of all
victimizations from 1992 to 1997, 92% of those reported by a
person age 65 or older were property crimes, versus 72% of those
reported by a person under age 65.

Prevalence of crime, 1992-97 

Property crime, not violence, provided the highest percentage of
crime against persons age 65 or older 
          
Figure.  -- Violence made up 27% of crimes against persons ages
12-64, compared to 6% of crimes against persons over 64.

Compared with other age groups, persons over 64 had lower rates
overall for both violent and property crime: 

Figure.  5.3 violent crimes per 1,000 persons age 65 or older --
about a tenth the rate for persons younger than 65 

Violence includes murder, rape and sexual assault, robbery, and
simple and aggravated assault.

Figure.  117.3 property crimes per 1,000 households with a
household head  age 65 or older -- about a third the rate for
younger households  

Property crime includes household burglary, motor vehicle theft,
and theft.

The elderly had lower victimization rates than other age groups
for all types of violent and property crime measured by the
NCVS, 1992-97 

Figure. Compared to persons ages 12-64, the elderly were --

-- About 5 times less likely to be victims of robbery

-- About 12 times less likely to be victims of aggravated or
simple assault.

Figure. Compared to households  with a head under age 65,
elderly households were --

-- About half as likely to be victims of burglary

-- About 3 times less likely to be victims of motor vehicle
theft or theft.

Declining rates of crime for persons age 65 or older, 1973-97

Rates of murder against persons age 65 or older declined after
1976 while those against persons ages 12-24 fluctuated  

Figure. The murder rate for persons age 65 or older declined by
half, from 0.56 murders per 10,000 persons in 1976 to 0.27 per
10,000 in 1997.

Rates of nonfatal violence against persons age 65 or older
declined, 1973-97

Figure. In 1973 persons age 65 or older  were assaulted or
robbed at a rate of 9 victimizations per 1,000 persons. (This
rate is weighted to adjust for NCVS questions changed in 1992. 
See Methodology.)  

By 1997 the rate had fallen to 4.5 victimizations per 1000
persons. 

For households with a person age 65 or older as head, property
crimes in 1997 occurred at half the 1973 rate  

Figure.  Rates of property crimes (burglary, motor vehicle
theft, and theft) against households with an elderly head of
household:  205 per 1,000 households in 1973 96 per 1,000 in
1997.      

Comparing rates of nonlethal violence

Each year between 1992 and 1997, about 3 per 100,000 persons age
65 or older were murdered 

Figure. Persons ages 12-24 were about 5 times as likely as the
elderly to be murdered.  Persons ages 25-49 were over 3 times as
likely.

In every age category, the rate of murder for males 
was about double that for females

Figure.  For every 100,000 persons age 65 or older --      
Males   --     4 murders
Females --     2 murders

For every 100,000 persons ages 12-64 --
Males   --     17 murders
Females --       4 murders

Whites were the least likely of the racial groups to be victims
of murder, regardless of age

Figure. For every 100,000 persons age 65 or older --
      White --  2 murders
      Black -- 12 murders
      Other --  3 murders



For every 100,000 persons ages 12-64 --
      White --  6 murders
      Black -- 43 murders
      Other --  7 murders  

Victims of nonlethal violence, 1992-97 

Among elderly victims of nonlethal violence, blacks experienced
higher rates than whites, and Hispanics experienced higher rates
than non-Hispanics

Figure. On average each year, 1992-97, the number of nonlethal
violent crimes for every 1,000 elderly persons in each category
-- 10 crimes against blacks
    5 against whites
   11 crimes against Hispanics
    5 crimes against non-Hispanics 

Elderly men experienced higher rates of nonlethal violence than
elderly women  

Figure. On average each year, 1992-97, the number of nonlethal
violent crimes for every 1,000 elderly persons in each category
-- 15 crimes against black men 
    6 crimes against white men
    7 crimes against black women*
    4 crimes against white women*

*The apparent difference between elderly women is not
statistically significant. 

Divorced or separated elderly persons had higher rates of
nonlethal violence than those who were married or widowed 

Figure. On average each year, 1992-97, the number of nonlethal
violent crimes for every 1,000 elderly persons in each category
-- 14 crimes against divorced/separated 
    4 crimes against married or widowed    

Property crime rates for households with an elderly head of
household were higher for blacks and Hispanics 

Figure. On average each year, 1992-97, for every 1,000
households with an elderly head of household, the number of
property crimes in each category --   
184 crimes against black households 
110 crimes against white households
168 crimes against Hispanic households
115 crimes against non-Hispanics.

Among households having a head of household age 65 or older,
higher rates of property crime victimization were associated
with divorced or separated persons rather than with married or
never married persons  

Figure. On average each year, 1992-97, for every 1,000
households with an elderly head of household, the number of
property crimes in each category --

186 crimes against households headed by a divorced or separated
man 154 crimes against households headed by a divorced or
separated woman.

Among households with an elderly head of household, property
crime rates were higher in those having annual incomes over
$50,000

Figure. On average each year, 1992-97, for every 1,000
households with an elderly head of household, the number of
property crimes ranged from  --
103 crimes against households with less than $15,000 per year 
to --
179 crimes against households with more than $50,000 per year. 

Victimization by those whom the victim knew well 

There is much interest in measuring what is often called "elder
abuse."  The general concept involved in the numerous
definitions of "elder abuse" is that the victim is injured,
neglected, or exploited because of vulnerabilities associated
with age, such as impaired physical or mental capacities.

The NCVS cannot accurately measure this category of crime, which
is difficult to determine using any methodology.  A mentally
impaired person may not be able to report a victimization or to
describe its details.  If the victimization is reported, the
report might not be believed.  Victims dependent on abusive
caretakers may not feel free to report the abuse. Financial
exploitation, including theft or fraud, may occur without the 
victim's knowledge.

                    
The NCVS does measure violent crimes committed against persons
age 65 or older by relatives, intimates, or persons well known
to the victim.  The NCVS includes crimes occurring to persons
living in households but not in institutional settings, such as
nursing homes.  Data on these violent crimes are presented to
provide some information on crimes that might be part of  "elder
abuse."

Information about murder comes from the Uniform Crime Reports.
Information is presented on murders that relatives or intimates
or persons known to the victim committed against victims age 65
or older.

For the persons age 65 or older, as for other age groups, most
violence measured by the NCVS is simple assault.  Simple assault
is defined as an attack without a weapon, resulting either in no
injury or in a minor injury, such as cuts or bruises. Simple
assault includes attempted attacks and verbal threats to attack
or kill the victim.

Each year on average between 1992 and 1997,  a relative or close
acquaintance injured about 36,000 persons age 65 or older and
killed about 500 

                Average annual elderly  
              victims per year, 1992-97

Nonlethal violence committed by --

When faced with violence by a relative, intimate, or close
acquaintance, about two-thirds of the elderly victims were at
home, about two-thirds avoided injury, and about half used some
self-protective measure 



                           Nonlethal violence against
                           persons age 65 or older

                           or others     By strangers
                           well known    or casual
                           to victim     acquaintances

*Estimate based on 10 or fewer cases.  

When comparing nonlethal violence committed by relatives or
persons well known to the victim with other nonlethal violence
against persons age 65 or older, 1992-97:

* There were no significant differences in whether the victims
used self-protective measures.  

* Injury appeared to be more likely for violence by relatives or
violence or well-known offenders, although the difference was
not statistically significant.  

*Violence by relatives or persons well known to the victim was
more likely to occur in the victim's home.

Relatives or intimates committed more than  1 in 4 of the
murders and 1 in 10 of the incidents of nonlethal violence
against persons age 65 or older

*Age is determined by the age of the head of the household, the
person responding to the interviewer. 

-- Household heads in all age groups often did not know the time
of day when property crimes occurred. 

-- Among elderly households, burglary and theft were about
equally likely to occur in the day or at night.

-- For all age groups, motor vehicle theft occurred more often
at night.

-- More than half of motor vehicle thefts from elderly
households occurred near their homes, compared with less than
half for other age groups.

-- Motor vehicle thefts from elderly households were less likely
than those from other age groups to occur in parking lots or
garages.

-- About 3 in 5 thefts from elderly households occurred near
their or a friend's or neighbor's home.  (Theft from a car is
categorized as a household theft.)

Elderly and younger victims did not differ in how burglars
entered their residences, and usually entry was not forced

*The estimate is based on 10 or fewer sample cases. 
a/Murder was nearly always reported to or discovered by police
agencies. 

-- Victims age 65 or older were more likely than other victims
to report robbery and simple assault to the police.


-- There were no differences between the elderly and those ages
12-64 in the extent to which they reported property crimes to
the police.

National Crime Victimization Survey methodology

The National Crime Victimization Survey measures personal and
household offenses, including crimes not reported to police. 
The crimes are rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and
simple assault, personal theft (purse snatching and pocket
picking), household burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft
from a house or car.  Information is obtained by interviewing
all occupants age 12 or older of housing units selected to
comprise a representative sample.

The sample also includes persons living in group quarters, such
as dormitories, rooming houses, and religious group dwellings. 
Excluded are crew members of merchant vessels, Armed Forces
personnel living in military barracks or temporary housing, and
institutionalized persons, such as correctional facility inmates
and hospital or nursing home patients.

A Census Bureau representative interviews each housing unit at
6-month intervals, spreading out the complete sample of the
household interviews over the entire year. Every 6 months
between 1992 and 1997, the Census Bureau interviewed about
85,000 persons in about 44,000 housing units about the crimes
they had experienced in the previous 6 months.  Yearly response
rates ranged from 89% to 96% of eligible households and
individuals.

Since sample survey data provide the estimates in this report,
these estimates are subject to sampling variation.  Comparisons
presented in this report are statistically significant at the
95% confidence level, meaning that the estimated difference is
greater than twice the standard error.  Statements of comparison
qualified by language such as "slightly," "somewhat," or
"marginal" indicated statistical significance at the 90% level
(1.6 standard error).

Some crimes of concern are not within the scope of the NCVS. 
Abuse of the elderly occurring in institutional settings is not
covered in NCVS, which is a household based survey.  The NCVS
does not measure fraud; therefore, fraud targeted at the
elderly, such as telemarketing scams, are not included.


Also, crimes that are measured by NCVS are based on information
that victims provide in telephone or personal interviews.  Elder
abuse is probably underreported, because some victims may be
unable to report,  afraid to discuss the abuse, or may not
regard mistreatment by relatives or caretakers as a crime.

If relatives or caretakers were taking personal or household
property from the victim without the victims' knowledge, these
crimes also would not be included.

NCVS data are useful for providing a comprehensive overview of
the entire elderly population in the United States.  Within this
population, however, there are people with particular
vulnerabilities whose victimization may be underreported or
outside the scope of the crimes measured by this survey.  

Other types of studies targeted at  specific groups, such as
elderly people in nursing houses, elderly victims of fraud, and
other similar studies are needed to complement data available
through the NCVS.

Calculation of rates and annual levels

The rates of crime in this report are annual average rates for
the period 1992 through 1997.  The numerator of a given number
is the sum of crimes that occurred for each year from 1992
through 1997; the denominator is the sum of the annual
population of persons or households for these year (or the
number falling within the  particular demographic group being
measured).  These numbers are multiplied by 1000 to obtain the
average annual rates.  Average annual levels of criminal
victimization are obtained by summing the number of
victimizations each year between 1992 and 1997 and dividing by
six.

The population totals used in this report are calculated from
estimates derived from the victimization survey.  Included in
the population are persons age 12 or older living in households,
including group quarters such as dormitories.  The estimates do
not include children under 12, institutionalized persons, U.S.
citizens living abroad, crew members of merchant vessels, and 
Armed Forces personnel living in military barracks.  The
percentages  are calculated using the method similar to the one
used for average annual rates.

The NCVS was redesigned in 1992 to improve survey methods and
collect previously unreported information. Data collected prior
to 1992 are not comparable to data collected using the
redesigned methodology.  The estimates for 1973-91 presented in
the trend figures on page 8 have been adjusted to make them
comparable to data collected under the redesigned methodology.
The adjustment methods are described in Criminal Victimization
1973-95 (NCJ 163069).

Information on murder

Murder data were obtained from the Uniform Crime Reports,
prepared by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  The
Supplemental Homicide Reports (SHR) data file for 1992-97 was
used to obtain characteristics of murder victims, offenders and
incidents.  There may be slight differences between these
estimates and those found in the yearly FBI publication, Crime
in the United States.  These differences occur, since data files
are updated with additional data that may not have been
available at the time of publication of the yearly report.
