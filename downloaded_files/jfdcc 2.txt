Highlights

Juvenile defendants in criminal courts

* In the Nation's 75 largest counties, juveniles transferred
to criminal courts represented about 1% of all felony
defendants.  

* Juveniles transferred to criminal court were generally
violent felony offenders.  Two-thirds were charged with a
violent offense, including about 11% with murder, 34% with
robbery, and 15% charged with felony assault.

* 63% of juveniles transferred to criminal courts were black
males, 29% were white males, 3% were black females, and 2%
were white females.

* 59% of juveniles transferred to criminal courts were
convicted of a felony, and 52% of those convicted of a felony
were sentenced to prison.

* About a third of juveniles in criminal courts sentenced to
State prison received a sentence of 4 years or less.  The
average prison sentence for juveniles convicted in criminal
courts was about 9 years; for those convicted of a violent
offense, the average prison sentence was nearly 11 years 
.
Defendants in juvenile courts 

* In the 75 largest counties, nearly 2% of juveniles age 15
or older formally handled in juvenile courts were transferred
to criminal courts by judicial waiver. Among those referred
to juvenile court for murder, 37% were judicially waived to
criminal court.
 
* Of juveniles formally processed in juvenile courts, 48%
were white males; 36%, black males; 7%, white females; and
5%, black females.

* 55% of juvenile defendants formally processed in juvenile
courts were adjudicated delinquent.

* Among juvenile defendants adjudicated delinquent, 40%
received a disposition of residential placement and 50%
received formal probation.

In the Nation's 75 largest counties, juveniles handled as
adults in criminal courts represented about 1% of all felony
defendants.  State statutes  define which persons are under
the original jurisdiction of the juvenile court system.  In
1994, 39 States and the District of Columbia defined the
upper age limit of juvenile court jurisdiction at age 17. 
The remaining 11 States set the upper age limit below age 17. 
Three States (Connecticut, New York, and North Carolina)
defined 16- and 17-year-olds as adults.  Eight States
(Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Missouri, Texas, and South Carolina) defined 17-year-olds as
adults.    

Each State legislature, however, has put in place mechanisms
that enable persons classified as juveniles in the State to
be transferred to the adult justice system and handled in
criminal court.  These mechanisms include judicial waiver,
concurrent jurisdiction, and statutorily excluding
certain offenses from juvenile court jurisdiction.   (See box
entitled "Mechanisms by which juveniles can reach criminal
court.")

Juveniles in criminal and juvenile courts

This report presents data on juveniles prosecuted as felony
defendants in criminal courts within the Nation's 75 largest
counties.  Comparable data are also presented on juvenile
defendants formally processed in the juvenile court system in
a selected number of the Nation's 75 largest counties.  

Every 2 years the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) gathers
information on a sample of felony defendants through the
State Court Processing Statistics(SCPS) project.  Data for
this report were combined from the 1990, 1992, and 1994 data
collections.  An estimated 7,110 defendants under age
18 faced charges in criminal court during May in the 3-year
period -- about a fourth (23%) of whom, based on age, would
be considered juveniles by State law.  Juvenile court data 
were provided by the National Center for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ).  

The National Juvenile Court Data Archive provided data on
more than 370,000 juvenile defendants formally processed in
juvenile courts in a selected number of counties among the
Nation's 75 largest. (See Methodology for description of
sampled counties from the NCJJ.) 



Most serious arrest charge

Criminal court

Among juveniles prosecuted in criminal courts in the
Nation's 75 largest counties, two-thirds were charged with a
violent felony offense --including robbery (34%), assault
(15%), and murder (11%) (table 2). About a sixth were
charged with a felony property offense.  For the remainder of
juveniles in  criminal courts, the most serious arrest
charge was a drug (14%) or a public-order offense (3%). 
Public-order offenses include weapons charges, 
driving-related charges, and other violations of social
order.

burglary, 56% of theft, and 59% of public-order defendants. 
Black defendants comprised 53% of defendants referred to
juvenile court for rape, 60% of robbery, and 59% of drug

Overall, black males accounted for about a third of
defendants in juvenile courts (not shown in a table).  About
40% of violent defendants in juvenile court were black males
compared to 70% of violent juveniles in criminal courts. 
White males accounted for the majority of juvenile
defendants referred to juvenile courts for murder (55%) and
burglary (64%).


Pretrial release and detention

Criminal court

Overall, about half of juveniles prosecuted in criminal
courts were released prior to the final disposition of their
case (table 6).  Public-order(19%) and violent (44%)
juvenile defendants were the least likely to be released
pretrial, while property (74%) and drug (63%) defendants
were the most likely.

Adjudication
 
Criminal court

Nearly two-thirds of juvenile defendants in criminal courts
were convicted (table 8).  About 9 in 10 of the convictions 
were for felonies.  By general offense category, conviction
rates in criminal court were 91% for public-order offenses
and 59% for violent offenses.

and are excluded from the table.  Data on adjudication outcome were available
for 85% of those cases that had been adjudicated.  Detail may not add to

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About 74% of juvenile property defendants in criminal court
and 70% of defendants charged with drug offenses were
convicted.  Juvenile defendants in criminal court charged
with public-order or drug charges were the most likely to
have received a felony conviction.

In most cases where the juvenile was not convicted in
criminal court, it was because the charges against the
defendant were dismissed by the prosecutor or the court. 
Dismissal occurred in about a fourth of juvenile felony cases
in criminal court.  Nearly 40% of defendants charged
with rape had their cases dismissed.  Overall, about 2% of
juvenile defendants in criminal court were acquitted,
including 7% of murder defendants and 11% of burglary
defendants.  About 9% of juvenile cases in criminal court had
other outcomes such as diversion or deferred adjudication.   

Fifty-one percent of juvenile defendants in criminal court
pleaded guilty to a felony, and an additional 5% pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor.  About 10%  of  juvenile cases
adjudicated within 1 year went to bench or jury trial.  A
fifth of the trials ended in an acquittal, while the
remainder resulted in a guilty verdict. 

Regardless of the method of adjudication, defendants who
were convicted were usually convicted of the original arrest
charge.  This was most likely to be the case when the
original offense was violent.  Among those charged with
murder and later convicted, 84% were convicted of
the original arrest charge.  The corresponding percentages
were also high for robbery 87%) and assault (76%).

Juvenile court

Among juvenile defendants formally processed in the juvenile
court system, 55% were adjudicated delinquent (table 9). 
Juvenile adjudication patterns differed little by offense
type, as at least half or more in each major offense category
were found delinquent.  Among defendants referred to juvenile
court for public-order offenses, 59% were found delinquent,
as were 51% of those referred for violent offenses.

Conviction and delinquent adjudication

Criminal court

Overall, about 9 in 10 juvenile convictions in criminal
court were felonies, with over half representing violent
convictions and a fifth property convictions (table 10).  The
remainder of juvenile defendants were convicted of
drug-related offenses (15%), public-order offenses (5%)
or misdemeanor offenses (8%).  By conviction offense, 25% of
juveniles in criminal court were convicted of robbery, 7%
were convicted of burglary, 15% of drug offenses, 14% of
felony assault, and 10% of theft. 

Juvenile court

Nearly half of defendants in juvenile courts were
adjudicated delinquent for a property offense, about a fifth
for a violent offense, and a fifth for a public-order
offense (table 11).

Sentencing

Criminal court

Overall, 68% of convicted juveniles in criminal court were
sentenced to incarceration in a State prison or local jail
(table 12).  Over half of juvenile felony convictions
resulted in a sentence to State prison, while over half of
juvenile  misdemeanor convictions resulted in a sentence to
local jail.  

Seventy-nine percent of juveniles convicted of violent
offenses in criminal court were sentenced to incarceration,
with nearly 7 in 10 violent convictions resulting in a
sentence to State prison.  Half of juveniles in criminal
court convicted of drug offenses were sentenced
to incarceration, with 34% sentenced to State prison.      

Thirty-one percent of juveniles convicted in criminal
court were sentenced to probation, and about 1% received
other nonincarceration sentences.  Forty-six percent of those
convicted  of drug offenses were sentenced to probation,
while 21% of those convicted of violent offenses had a
similar outcome.  By specific offense type, three-fourths of
juveniles in criminal court convicted of burglary were
sentenced to probation.

Juvenile court

In juvenile court during this period, 40% of delinquent
defendants were sentenced to residential placement, 50% were
sentenced to probation, and 10% to other sanctions (table
13).  Over half of defendants adjudicated delinquent for
murder (77%) and robbery (57%) were sentenced to residential
placement.

Among defendants adjudicated delinquent in juvenile court,
half were sentenced to probation.  Fifty-four percent of
those adjudicated delinquent for property offenses and 47% of
those adjudicated delinquent for violent offenses received
probation.

Mechanisms by which juveniles can reach criminal court

All States allow juveniles to be proceeded against as adults
in criminal court under certain circumstances.  The
following description of mechanisms that States use is
summarized from State Responses to Serious and Violent
Juvenile Crime by Patricia Torbet and others.

In all States except New Mexico, Nebraska, New York, and
Connecticut, juvenile court judges may waive jurisdiction
over the case and transfer it to criminal court.  The waiver
and transfer may be based on their own judgment, in response
to the State prosecutor's request, or in some States at the
request of juveniles or their parents.  

In a related provision -- called a presumptive waiver --
juvenile offenders must be waived to criminal court unless
they can prove that they are amenable to juvenile
rehabilitation.  


This type of provision shifts the burden of proof from the 
prosecutor to the juvenile.  As of 1995, 12 States and the 
District of Columbia had enacted presumptive provisions.  

Concurrent jurisdiction statutes, also called prosecutorial
discretion or direct-file, give prosecutors the authority to
file certain juvenile cases in either juvenile or criminal
court.  Ten States and the District of Columbia had
concurrent jurisdiction statutes as of 1995.  

Statutory exclusion of certain serious offenses from
juvenile court jurisdiction is another mechanism in many
States.  This would also include mandatory waiver
provisions.  Thirty-six States and the District of Columbia
exclude selected offenses from juvenile court jurisdiction. 
The most common offenses excluded are capital murder, murder
of other types, and serious crimes against persons.  
Several States exclude juveniles charged with felonies if
they have prior adjudications or convictions.  

Reverse waiver provisions have been enacted in 22 States
that allow the criminal court, usually on a motion from the
prosecutor, to transfer excluded or direct-file cases back
to the juvenile court for adjudication and/or disposition. 
 
"Once an adult, always an adult" provisions, enacted in 17
States and the District of Columbia, require that once the
juvenile court jurisdiction is waived or the juvenile is
sentenced in criminal court as a result of direct filing or
exclusion, all subsequent cases involving the juvenile
offender will be under criminal court jurisdiction.  (For
information about specific provisions of the various
mechanisms listed above, see Juvenile Offenders and Victims:
A National Report, 1995, pp. 85-89.)

Appendix A.  Judicial processing of felony defendants under
25, by State juvenile age definition, 1990, 1992, and 1994

The table shown compares the judicial processing of juvenile
felony defendants in criminal courts with that of other young
felony defendants. Data on persons younger than 25 years
prosecuted in State courts are presented  in three
categories. The first column includes those 
defendants between ages 18 and 24 at the time of arrest.  The
second includes felony defendants under age 18 who, by
definition, were considered adults by State age statute.  For
example, in New York all 16- and 17-year-old defendants were
considered adults under 18.  Finally, defendants defined by
State age statutes as under the original jurisdiction of the
juvenile courts were considered juveniles in criminal courts. 

An estimated 57,129 felony cases were filed against
defendants age 18 to 24 in the State courts of the Nation's
75 largest counties during May 1990, 1992, and 1994. 
By comparison, 7,110 felony defendants under age 18 were
prosecuted in the State courts during a similar time frame. 
Of these defendants under age 18, 23% or 1,638 cases were
defined as juveniles by State statutes and the remaining 77%
(5,472 cases) were defined as adults under 18. 
  
Juvenile defendants compared to adults 18 to 24

Defendants defined as juveniles in criminal courts were 
more than twice as likely to be charged with a violent
offense than defendants 18 to 24.  Among violent felony 
defendants, juveniles in criminal court were more likely than
defendants 18 to 24 to be --  
* detained pretrial prior to case disposition  
* convicted of a felony offense  
* sentenced to State prison.

cases.  Detail may not add to subtotal because of rounding.


Juvenile defendants compared to adults under 18

The average prison sentence for juveniles convicted of
violent offenses in criminal courts was about 10 1/2 years (a
mean of 127 months and a medianof 78 months).  For adult
defendants under 18 the average prison sentence for violent
offenses was about 8 years (a mean of 97 months and a median
of 72).   

Of juveniles sentenced to prison for violent offenses--

* 7% were sentenced to 2 years or less 
* 43% from 2+ years to 6 years 
* 26% from 6+ years to 10 years
* 22% to over 10 years, and 2% to life imprisonment.

Appendix B.  Estimating the number of juveniles handled in
adult courts

Sources for statistics on juveniles in adult courts

* The National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP) is a
biennial survey that compiles information on the sentences
that felons receive in State courts nationwide and on
characteristics of the felons.  The 1994 survey estimated
that 21,000 felons were younger than 18 at arrest,
conviction, or sentencing in State courts nationwide.  Of
these felons, an estimated 12,000 were juveniles convicted of
a felony in State courts.  

* The National Survey of State Prosecutors (NSP) is a
nationally representative sample drawn from a list  of all
prosecutors' offices that handle felony cases in State courts.  
The 1996 NSP estimated that 27,000 juveniles were 
proceeded against in criminal court by prosecutors' offices.  

* The  National Juvenile Court Data Archive which is
supported by OJJDP grant number 95-JN-FX-0008, at the 
National Center for Juvenile Justice (NCJJ), contains 
the most detailed information available on youth
involved in the juvenile justice system and on activities of
U.S. juvenile courts.  In 1990, 1992, and 1994, over 377,000 
defendants age 15 or older were formally processed in 
juvenile courts in a selected number of the Nation's  75 
largest counties.  Of these defendants, approximately 1.9% 
were transferred to criminal court by way of  judicial waiver.  
 
* The State Court Processing Statistics (SCPS) program is a
biennial data collection on the processing  of felony defendants 
in the State courts of the Nation's 75 largest counties.  
During May of 1990, 1992, and 1994 an estimated 7,110 
defendants under age 18 faced charges in criminal court --
about a fourth of whom, based on age, would be considered
juveniles by State law. 

Difficulties in developing National estimates  
for the number of juveniles in adult courts:

* Lack of uniform reporting methods by States regarding 
juvenile transfer statistics, including the mechanisms 
by which juveniles reach adult courts 

* Variation in the definition of juvenile offenders across
States

* Frequent changes in State statutes defining juvenile court
jurisdiction.

Appendix C.  Juveniles adjudicated as adults in the Federal
system

Juveniles may be adjudicated as adults in the Federal system
if the offense charged was a violent felony or drug trafficking or
importation and if the offense was committed after the
juvenile's 15th birthday.  Or, if the juvenile possessed a
firearm during a violent offense, the juvenile may be
adjudicated as an adult if the offense was committed after
the juvenile's 13th birthday.  

Before proceeding against a juvenile in Federal court, the
U.S. attorney must certify to the court a substantial Fed-
eral interest in the case and at least one of the following: 

* The State does not have jurisdiction.

* The State refuses to assume jurisdiction.

* The State with jurisdiction does not have adequate
programs or services for juvenile offenders.

* The offense charged is a violent felony, a drug
trafficking or importation offense, or a firearm offense (18
U.S.C. Section 5032).

While the U.S. Department of Justice does not systema-
tically collect information on juvenile transfers to Federal
courts, it is estimated that during the 12 months ending
September 30, 1994, 65 juveniles were referred to the
Attorney General for transfer to adult status.

Methodology

State Court Processing Statistics (SCPS)
 
The sample of juvenile defendants in criminal courts were
selected from combined SCPS surveys from 1990, 1992, and
1994.  Juvenile status was determined based on State statutes
for maximum juvenile court jurisdiction.  Age of defendant
was age at arrest. In 1994 the maximum age for juvenile court
jurisdiction was 17 or younger in 39 States and the District
of Columbia (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California,
Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii,
Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New  Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West
Virginia, and Wisconsin). 

In eight States the maximum age for juvenile court
jurisdiction was 16 (Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, South Carolina, and
Texas).  In an additional three states, the maximum age for
juvenile court jurisdiction was 15 (Connecticut, New York,
and North Carolina).  For example, in New York all felony
defendants 15 and younger in State court were considered to
be juveniles by definition and reached criminal court by way
of one or more juvenile transfer mechanisms.  The mechanism
by which these defendants reached criminal courts is unknown. 
Since 1994 New Hampshire and Wisconsin have lowered their
juvenile age status from 17 to 16.

The SCPS sample was designed and selected by the U.S. Bureau
of the Census under BJS supervision.  It is a 2-stage stratified
sample, with 40(or 39 in 1994) of the 75 most populous
counties selected at the first stage and a systematic sample
of State court felony filings (defendants) within each county
selected at the second stage.  The 40 (39 in 1994) counties
were divided into 4 first-stage strata based on court filing
information obtained through a telephone survey.  In 1990 and
1992, 14 counties were included in the sample with certainty
because of their large number of court filings.  The
remaining 26 counties were allocated to the 3 non-certainty
strata based on the variance of felony court dispositions. 
In 1994, 12 counties were included in the sample with
certainty because of their large number of court filings. 
The remaining counties were allocated to the three
non-certainty strata based on the variance of felony court
dispositions.  

The second-stage sampling (filings) were designed to
represent all defendants who had felony cases filed with the
court during the month of May in 1990, 1992, and 1994.  The 
participating jurisdictions provided data for every felony case 
filed on selected days during that month.  In 1990, each 
jurisdiction provided data for the 5, 10, 15, or 31 days in May 
from which to sample all felony defendants who had felony charges
filed.  In 1992 and 1994, each jurisdiction provided data
for 1, 2, or 4 weeks' filings in May.  Data from jurisdictions 
that were not required to provide a full month of filings were 
weighted to represent the full month.  

In 1990, data on 13,597 sample felony cases were collected
from the 40 sampled jurisdictions, representing 512 weighted
juvenile cases in criminal courts during the month of May in
the 75 most populous counties. In 1992 data on 13,206 sample
felony cases were collected from the 40 sampled jurisdictions, 
representing 480 weighted juvenile cases in criminal courts 
during May in the 75 most populous counties.  In 1994, 14,691
sample felony cases were collected from the 39 sampled jurisdictions, 
representing 646 weighted juvenile cases in criminal courts during 
May in the 75 most populous counties.  Cases that could not be 
classified into one of the four major crime categories (violent, 
property, drug, or public-order) because of incomplete information
were omitted from the analysis.  Data collection was
supervised by the Pretrial Services Resource Center of
Washington, D.C. 

For counties found in the SCPS and NJCDA samples see
Appendix D.

Because the data came from a sample, a sampling error
(standard error) is associated with each reported number.  In
general, if the difference between two SCPS-generated numbers
is greater than twice the standard error for that difference,
we can say that we are 95% confident of a real difference and
that the apparent difference is not simply the result of
using a sample rather than the entire population.  All
differences discussed in this report were statistically
significant at or above the 95-percent confidence level.  

National Juvenile Court Data Archive (NJCDA)

Data for juvenile defendants processed in the juvenile
courts of the 75 largest counties in 1990, 1992, and 1994
were provided by Howard Snyder of the National Center for
Juvenile Justice (NCJJ).  The data were provided for counties
matching those in the SCPS program for the respective years. 
The juvenile court sample includes only those youths age 15
or older in formally processed delinquency cases not
transferred to criminal court.  Defendants processed
informally in the juvenile justice system were not included
in this analysis.  Due to the nature of the sample, standard
errors cannot be calculated  because the probability of
selection was unknown.    

In Florida, 67 counties are administered in 11 juvenile
justice districts. These districts contain one or more
counties, and each county is in only one district.  In the
juvenile court data, cases from different counties could not
be distinguished within a specific district. As a result,
this analysis includes data from any Florida district that
contains at least one sampled county.  The Florida districts
included are the following: District 4 (Baker, Clay, Duval,
Flagler, Nassau, St. Johns, and Volusia); District 5 (Pasco
and Pinellas); District 6 (Hardee, Highlands, Hillsborough,
Manatee, and Polk); District 7 (Brevard, Orange, Osceola, and
Seminole); District 9(Indian River, Martin, Okeechobee, Palm
Beach, and St. Lucie); District 10 (Broward); and District 11
(Dade and Monroe).
