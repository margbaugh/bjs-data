**************
Introduction
**************

From 1994 to 2010, the overall rate of serious violent crime 
against youth declined by 77%, from 61.9 victimizations per 
1,000 youth ages 12 to 17 in 1994 to 14.0 per 1,000 in 2010 
(figure 1). Among serious violent crimes against youth, the 
rate of rape or sexual assault declined by 68%, robbery 
declined by 77%, and aggravated assault declined by 80% 
(table 2). The overall rate of simple assault declined by 83% 
during the same period, from 125.1 victimizations per 1,000 
youth in 1994 to 21.6 per 1,000 in 2010. Declines in simple 
assault against youth were similar from 1994 to 2002 (down 
61%) and from 2002 to 2010 (down 56%). Declines in serious 
violent crime were greater from 1994 to 2002 (down 69%) than 
from 2002 to 2010 (down 27%).

The data in this report were developed from the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey 
(NCVS), which annually collects information on nonfatal 
victimizations reported and not reported to the police 
against persons age 12 or older from a nationally 
representative sample of U.S. households. Homicide data in 
this report are from the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports 
(SHR).

This report presents overall trends in violent crime against 
youth and examines patterns in serious violent crime and 
simple assault by the demographic characteristics of the 
victim, whether the crime involved a weapon or injury, the 
location and time of the incident, the victim-offender 
relationship, and whether police were notified. These 
estimates were developed as an indicator of the changes over 
time in the nature of youth victimization and the likelihood 
that violent crime against youth was reported to police. 
 
Trend estimates provided are based on 2-year rolling 
averages. For ease of presentation, estimates are referenced 
according to the most recent year. For example, estimates 
reported for 1994, 2002, and 2010 represent the average 
annual estimates for 1993-1994, 2001-2002, and 2009-2010. 
This method of analysis improves the reliability and 
stability of estimate comparison over time.

Highlights 
************

* In 2010, male (14.3 victimizations per 1,000) and female 
(13.7 per 1,000) youth were equally likely to experience 
serious violent crime—rape or sexual assault, robbery, and 
aggravated assault. In comparison, male youth (79.4 per 
1,000) were nearly twice as likely as female youth (43.6 per 
1,000) to experience serious violent crime in 1994. 

* Among racial and ethnic groups, black youth experienced the 
highest rates of serious violent crime in 2010. From 2002 to 
2010, rates of serious violent crime declined among white 
(down 26%) and Hispanic (down 65%) youth, but remained the 
same among black youth. 

* From 1994 to 2010, youth living with an unmarried head of 
household were generally more likely than youth living with a 
married head of household to be victims of violent crime. 
During this period, the decline in serious violent crime was 
greater for youth in married households (down 86%) than the 
decline among youth in unmarried households (down 65%). 

* From 1994 to 2010, more than half of violent crime against 
youth went unreported to police. The percentage of serious 
violent crime reported to police increased from 37% to 43% 
between the two periods from 1994-02 and 2002-10. The 
percentage of simple assaults reported to police increased 
from 20% to 26% over the same two periods.

* The rate of serious violent crime against youth ages 12 to 
17 involving weapons declined by 80% from 1994 to 2010, and 
the rate of serious violent crime involving serious injury 
decreased by 63%.

Adult violent victimization
*****************************

The decline in violent crime against adults from 1994 to 2010 
corresponded with the decline in violent crime against youth
Adults age 18 or older and youth ages 12 to 17 experienced 
similar declines in serious violent crime and simple assault 
from 1994 to 2010. Among adults, the overall rate of serious 
violent crime declined by 73%, from about 24.1 victimizations 
per 1,000 in 1994 to about 6.5 per 1,000 in 2010 (figure 2). 
The rate of simple assault declined by 71% during the same 
18-year period, from 43.3 victimizations per 1,000 in 1994 to 
12.8 per 1,000 in 2010. 

From 1994 to 2002, the rate of serious violent crime among 
adults age 18 or older declined by 61%, from 24.1 
victimizations per 1,000 in 1994 to 9.5 per 1,000 in 2002 
(table 1). From 2002 to 2010, adults experienced a relatively 
smaller decline (down 32%), from 9.5 victimizations per 1,000 
in 2002 to 6.5 per 1,000 in 2010.

Simple assault among adults from 1994 to 2002 declined by 
57%, from 43.3 victimizations per 1,000 adults in 1994 to 
18.6 per 1,000 in 2002. From 2002 to 2010, adults experienced 
a relatively smaller decline (down 31%), from 18.6 
victimizations per 1,000 in 2002 to 12.8 per 1,000 in 2010.

***************************************************

***********************************
From 1994 to 2010, rates of violent 
crime against youth declined across 
all crime types 
************************************

Rape or sexual assault against youth ages 12 to 17 declined 
by 68%, from 7.0 victimizations per 1,000 youth in 1994 to 
2.2 per 1,000 in 2010. During the same period, robbery 
against youth declined by 77%, and aggravated assault 
declined by 80% (table 2). Overall, declines in serious 
violent crime among youth were greater from 1994 to 2002 
(down 69%) than from 2002 to 2010 (down 27%).

************************************
Male and female youth were equally 
likely to be victims of serious 
violent crime in 2010 
************************************

Although male youth victimization rates were nearly twice as 
large as female rates in 1994, male and female youth were 
equally likely to experience serious violent crime in 2010 
(table 3; figure 3). Since the male victimization rate 
exhibited a greater decline than the female rate, differences 
between the rates of serious violent crime experienced by 
male and female youth diminished over time. The rate of 
serious violent crime against male youth ages 12 to 17 
declined by 82% from 1994 to 2010, while the rate against 
female youth declined by 69% during the same period. Across 
sexes, serious violent crime declined more rapidly from 1994 
to 2002 than from 2002 to 2010.

The rate of simple assault declined by more than 80% from 
1994 to 2010 for both male and female youth. Unlike serious 
violent crime, differences between the rate of simple assault 
experienced by male and female youth did not change much from 
1994 to 2010. The male rate was about 1.5 times greater than 
the female rate in 1994, and was still slightly higher (1.4 
times) in 2010.

************************************
Youth ages 12 to 14 and youth ages 
15 to 17 experienced declines in 
serious violent crime and simple 
assault from 1994 to 2010  
************************************

The rate of serious violent victimization against youth ages 
12 to 14 declined from 63.3 victimizations per 1,000 in 1994 
to 12.0 per 1,000 in 2010. The serious violent victimization 
rate among youth ages 15 to 17 declined from 60.6 per 1,000 
in 1994 to 15.9 per 1,000 in 2010. From 1994 to 2010, serious 
violent crime declined 81% for youth ages 12 to 14 and 
declined 74% for youth ages 15 to 17 (figure 4). Youth ages 
12 to 14 and youth ages 15 to 17 experienced larger declines 
in serious violent crime from 1994 to 2002 than from 2002 to 
2010 (table 4)
 
Simple assault also declined from 1994 to 2010 for both youth 
ages 12 to 14 (down 84%) and youth ages 15 to 17 (down 80%). 
From 1994 to 2002, youth ages 12 to 14 experienced larger 
declines in simple assault (down 65%) compared to youth ages 
15 to 17 (down 54%). From 2002 to 2010, youth ages 12 to 14 
(down 55%) and youth ages 15 to 17 (down 57%) experienced 
similar rates of decline.

************************************
Serious violent crime and simple 
assault declined for white, black, 
and Hispanic youth from 1994 to 2010
************************************

From 1994 to 2010, rates of serious violent crime declined 
overall for white non-Hispanic (down 79%), black non-Hispanic 
(down 66%), and Hispanic (down 87%) youth (table 5). Serious 
violent crime against black youth (25.4 victimizations per 
1,000 youth ages 12 to 17) was more than twice that of white 
(11.7 per 1,000) and Hispanic (11.3 per 1,000) youth in 2010. 
In comparison, the rate of serious violence for black youth 
was 1.3 times greater than the rate for white youth and 
similar to the rate for Hispanic youth in 1994 (figure 5).

The increasing difference in rates of serious violent crime 
between black youth and youth of other racial or ethnic 
groups from 1994 to 2010 was primarily associated with 
patterns of change that occurred from 2002 to 2010. Among 
white youth, serious violent crime declined by 72% from 1994 
to 2002, and decreased slightly by 26% from 2002 to 2010. 
Serious violent crime against Hispanic youth declined by 62% 
from 1994 to 2002, and decreased by 65% from 2002 to 2010. 
Among black youth, the rate of serious violent crime declined 
by 67% from 1994 to 2002, but did not change significantly 
from 2002 to 2010.

From 1994 to 2010, simple assault also declined for white 
(down 85%), black (down 62%), and Hispanic (down 81%) youth. 
However, black youth did not experience a significant 
reduction in the rate of simple assault from 2002 to 2010, 
while white (down 61%) and Hispanic (down 55%) youth 
experienced a significant decline (figure 6). In 1994, black 
youth reported a lower rate of simple assault (79.0 
victimizations per 1,000 youth) compared to white (143.5 per 
1,000) and Hispanic (98.8 per 1,000) youth. By 2010, the rate 
of simple assault for black youth (29.9 per 1,000) was 
similar to the rate for white youth (21.5 per 1,000) and 
slightly higher than the rate for Hispanic youth (19.0 per 
1,000).

************************************
Youth residing in urban, suburban, 
and rural areas experienced declines 
in serious violent crime and simple 
assault from 1994 to 2010
************************************

Rates of serious violent crime and simple assault declined 
among youth living in urban, suburban, and rural areas from 
1994 to 2010 (figure 7). From 1994 to 2010, the rate of 
serious violent crime declined by 76% among youth living in 
urban areas, by 81% among youth in suburban areas, and by 72% 
amoung youth in rural areas (table 6). Across all three 
locations, the overall declines were driven by declines from 
1994 to 2002. Youth residing in suburban areas also 
experienced a decline in serious violent crime (down 44%) 
from 2992 to 2010. Those living in urban and rural areas did 
not experience a significant decline during the later period.

From 1994 to 2010, the rate of simple assault declined by 
about 80% among youth in urban areas, 84% among youth in 
suburban areas, and 87% among youth in rural areas (figure 
8). In both 1994 and 2010, youth in urban and suburban areas 
experienced similar rates of simple assault, which were 
slightly higher than the simple assault rate for youth in 
rural areas.

************************************
Youth living with an unmarried head 
of household experienced a higher 
rate of serious violent crime than 
youth living with a married head 
of household
************************************

With the exception of 2008, youth living with an unmarried 
head of household generally experienced a higher rate of 
serious violent crime than youth living with a married head 
of household from 1994 to 2010 (figure 9). In 1994, the rate 
of serious violence among youth residing in unmarried 
households was about 1.5 times greater than the rate among 
youth in married households. In comparison, the rate of 
serious violence among youth in unmarried households was 3.8 
times greater than the rate among youth in married households 
in 2010. The increasing difference in rates of serious 
violent crime between youth residing in married households 
and youth in unmarried households from 1994 to 2010 was 
driven by a greater overall decline in serious violent crime 
against youth living in married households (down 86%) (table 
7).

The difference in simple assault rates between youth residing 
in married households and youth in unmarried households 
remained relatively stable from 1994 to 2010. In 1994, the 
rate of simple assault against youth residing in unmarried 
households (159.8 victimizations per 1,000 youth) was about 
1.4 times greater than the rate among youth in married 
households (111.0 per 1,000). In 2010, the rate of simple 
assault against youth living in unmarried households (29.5 
per 1,000) was about 1.6 times greater than the rate among 
youth in married households (17.9 per 1,000).

************************************
From 1994 to 2010, the rate of serious 
violent crime against youth involving 
a weapon or injury decreased 
************************************

From 1994 to 2010, the rate of serious violent crime against 
youth in which the offender had a gun, knife, or other type 
of weapon declined from 40.7 victimizations per 1,000 persons 
ages 12 to 17 in 1994 to 8.1 per 1,000 in 2010. The rate of 
serious violent crime against youth in which the offender had 
a weapon decreased by 80%, while the rate of serious violent 
crime in which the offender did not have a weapon declined by 
73% (table 8). Declines in weapon-related youth victimization 
occurred for all types of weapons.

Serious violent crime against youth that involved injury also 
declined, from 19.2 victimizations per 1,000 youth in 1994 to 
4.2 per 1,000 in 2010. Violent crime involving serious 
injuries, such as broken bones, concussions, gun shot, or 
stab wounds, declined by 63%. Violent crime resulting in 
minor injuries, such as bruises and scrapes, declined by 81%.

***************************************************

***************************
Youth homicide, 1993–2010
***************************

Since the NCVS collects data on violence by asking persons 
about their victimization experiences, the NCVS does not 
study homicide. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) uses 
data from the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) to 
study homicide rates among various age groups. According to 
the SHR, the homicide rate for youth ages 12 to 17 declined 
by 65%, from 8.4 homicides per 100,000 youth in 1993 to 3.0 
per 100,000 in 2010. Most of the decline in youth homicide 
occurred from 1993 to 2000, when the rate declined by 59% 
(from 8.4 per 100,000 in 1993 to 3.4 per 100,000 in 2000). 
During the early 2000s, the youth homicide rate fluctuated, 
increasing in 2006 and 2007. In 2010, the youth homicide rate 
was about 13% lower than the rate in 2000.
***************************************************

************************************
Rates of simple assault and serious 
violent crime against youth occurring
at school and at nonschool locations
declined from 1994 to 2010
************************************

In 1994, the rate of serious violent crime against youth was 
about three times greater at nonschool locations, including 
parks and public playgrounds, the victim’s home, or the homes 
of the victim’s neighbors, relatives, or friends
(44.5 victimizations per 1,000 youth ages 12 to 17), than 
on school grounds (17.4 per 1,000) (table 9). In comparison, 
the rate of serious violent victimization at schools (6.6 per 
1,000) was similar to the rate at nonschool locations (7.4 
per 1,000) in 2010. From 1994 to 2010, the rate of serious 
violent crime occurring on school grounds declined by 62%, 
and the rate of serious violent crime at nonschool locations 
declined by 83%. Declines in serious violent crime against 
youth on school grounds occurred primarily from 1994 to 2002, 
while declines in violent crime at nonschool locations 
occurred from 1994 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2010.

From 1994 to 2010, the rates of simple assault against youth 
on school grounds and at nonschool locations also declined. 
Simple assault occurring on school grounds declined by 81% 
(from 70.3 per 1,000 in 1994 to 13.2 per 1,000 in 2010), with 
similar declines occurring from 1994 to 2002 (58%) and from 
2002 to 2010 (55%). Simple assault at nonschool locations 
declined by 85%, from 54.9 per 1,000 youth in 1994 to 8.4 per 
1,000 in 2010.

************************************
From 2000 to 2010, declines in 
serious violent crime and simple 
assault occurred across all times 
of the day
************************************

Serious violent crime and simple assault rates against youth 
declined during all times of the day from 2000 to 2010 (table 
10).1 In both 2000 and 2010, rates of simple assault and 
serious violent crime were highest from 
6 a.m. to 3 p.m. The next highest rates of simple assault and 
serious violent crime occurred during the after-school hours 
from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., when students were typically 
participating in extracurricular or leisure activities or 
traveling home from school. From 2000 to 2010, serious 
violent crime occurring from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. declined by 
32%, and serious violent crime occurring from 3 p.m. to 6 
p.m. declined by 59%. During the same period, simple assault 
occurring from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. declined by 65%, while simple 
assault occurring from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. declined by 57%.

Due to the different number of hours in each time span—two 
consisting of nine-hour periods (6 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 
9 p.m. to 6 a.m.) and two consisting of three-hour periods 
(3 p.m. to 6 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.)—BJS produced hour-
adjusted victimization rates.2 These rates revealed that 
serious violent crime and simple assault against youth ages 
12 to 17 occurred at higher rates in the after-school hours 
from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. in 2000 (table 11). In 2010, the rate 
of serious violent crime against youth occurring from 3 p.m. 
to 6 p.m. was similar to the rate from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 6 
p.m. to 9 p.m., but 11 times greater than the rate from 
9 p.m. to 6 a.m. The rate of simple assault occurring from 
3 p.m. to 6 p.m. was similar to the rate from 6 a.m. to 3 
p.m., but 5 times greater than the rate from 6 p.m. to 9 
p.m., and 11 times greater than the rate from 9 p.m. to 6 
a.m.

************************************
During the 1994-02 and 2002-10 
periods, more than half of violent 
crime against youth was not reported 
to police
************************************

The analysis on reporting and not reporting to police was 
based on two 9-year periods, 1994-02 and 2002-10. From the 
1994-02 to the 2002-10 period, there was an increase in the 
proportion of serious violent crime and simple assault 
against youth ages 12 to 17 reported to police (table 12). 
Serious violent crime was more likely to be reported to 
police than simple assault; however, the majority of violent 
crime against youth was not reported to police. During the 
1994-02 period, 62% of serious violent crime and 79% of 
simple assault was not reported to police. During the 2002-10 
period, approximately 56% of serious violent crime and 72% of 
simple assault against youth was not reported to police.

Youth victims gave many specific reasons for not reporting 
violent crimes to police. During the 2002-10 period, the most 
frequent reasons were that the incident was reported to 
another official (30%) (such as a school official), 
considered not important enough to the victim to report 
(15%), or considered to be a private or personal matter (16%) 
(table 13). Other reasons youth provided for not reporting 
the victimization to police included that the offender was a 
child (7%), the victim feared reprisal (4%), and the victim 
believed police would not bother doing anything to help (5%).

************************************
Violent crime against youth perpetrated 
by strangers and nonstrangers declined
from 1994 to 2010
************************************

Youth ages 12 to 17 experienced similar rates of serious 
violent crime committed by strangers and nonstrangers in 
1994. However, in 2010, the rate of serious violence 
committed by nonstrangers (8.9 per 1,000) was higher than the 
rate committed by strangers (4.5 per 1,000) (table 14). 

Rates of stranger and nonstranger violent crime against youth 
declined from 1994 to 2010. The rate of serious violent crime 
against youth committed by strangers declined by 84% from 
1994 to 2010 and simple assault by strangers declined by 76%. 
During the same period, the rate of serious violent crime 
committed by offenders known to the victim declined by 73% 
and simple assault by known offenders declined by 86%.

************************************
Among youth ages 12 to 17, females 
were more likely than males to be 
victimized by an intimate partner
************************************

The analysis of trends in intimate partner violence against 
male and female youth was also based on two 9-year periods, 
1994-02 and 2002-10. During the 1994-02 and 2002-10 periods, 
the rates of violent crime against male and female youth 
committed by a nonintimate partner were higher than the rates 
of violent crime committed by an intimate partner (table 15). 
During the 1994-02 period, the rate of serious violent crime 
against youth committed by an intimate partner was greater 
among females (2.0 victimizations per 1,000) than males (0.2 
per 1,000). During the 2002-10 period, the rate of serious 
violent crime against youth by an intimate partner was also 
greater among females (1.5 per 1,000) than males (0.1 per 
1,000). 

Similarly, the rate of simple assault against youth committed 
by an intimate partner during the 1994-02 period was greater 
for females (4.2 per 1,000) than males (0.5 per 1,000). This 
was also true during the 2002-10 period 
(1.2 per 1,000 female youth, compared to 0.1 per 1,000 male 
youth). Among female youth, the rate of serious violent crime 
by an intimate partner did not decline significantly between 
the two periods, while the rate of simple assault by an 
intimate partner declined by 71%.

Methodology

****************
Survey coverage
***************

The Bureau of Justice of Statistics’ (BJS) National Crime 
Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an annual data collection 
conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. The NCVS is a self-
report survey in which interviewed persons are asked about 
the number and characteristics of victimizations experienced 
during the prior 6 months. The NCVS collects information on 
nonfatal personal crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, 
aggravated and simple assault, and personal larceny) and 
property crimes (burglary, motor vehicle theft, and other 
theft) both reported and not reported to police. In addition 
to providing annual level and change estimates on criminal 
victimization, the NCVS is the primary source of information 
on the nature of criminal victimization incidents. Survey 
respondents provide information about themselves (such as 
age, sex, race and ethnicity, marital status, education 
level, and income) and whether they experienced 
victimization. Information is collected for each 
victimization incident about the offender (such as age, race 
and ethnicity, sex, and victim-offender relationship), 
characteristics of the crime (including time and place of 
occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic 
consequences), whether the crime was reported to police, 
reasons why the crime was or was not reported, and 
experiences with the criminal justice system. 

The NCVS is administered to persons age 12 or older from a 
nationally representative sample of households in the United 
States. The NCVS defines a household as a group of members 
who all reside at a sampled address. Persons are considered 
household members when the sampled address is their usual 
place of residence at the time of the interview and when they 
have no usual place of residence elsewhere. Once selected, 
households remain in the sample for 3 years, and eligible 
persons in these households are interviewed every 6 months 
for a total of seven interviews. New households rotate into 
the sample on an ongoing basis to replace outgoing households 
that have been in the sample for the 3-year period. The 
sample includes persons living in group quarters, such as 
dormitories, rooming houses, and religious group dwellings, 
and excludes persons living in military barracks and 
institutional settings, such as correctional or hospital 
facilities, and the homeless. (For more detail, see the 
Survey Methodology in Criminal Victimization in the United 
States, 2008, NCJ 231173, BJS website, May 2011.)

In 2010, about 41,000 households and 73,300 individuals age 
12 or older were interviewed for the NCVS. Each household was 
interviewed twice during the year. The response rate was 
92.3% of households and 87.5% of eligible individuals.

Victimizations that occurred outside of the U.S. were 
excluded from this report. From 1993 to 2010, less than 1% of 
the total unweighted victimizations occurred outside the U.S. 
and was excluded from the analyses.

Measuring race and ethnicity and 
household structure in the NCVS
************************************

Race and ethnicity
*******************

The NCVS uses Census guidelines to measure respondent race 
and Hispanic origin. Prior to 2003, federal guidelines for 
racial classification were based on one of five self-reported 
racial categories: American Indian/Aleut/Eskimo, 
Asian/Pacific Islander, black, white, or other. In an effort 
to reflect changes in national diversity, federal guidelines 
were effectively changed in January 2003. These changes 
resulted in twenty categories of race, including one race 
only (e.g., white only, black only, American Indian/Alaskan 
Native only, Asian only, and Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander 
only) and two or more races (e.g., white-black, black-Asian, 
white-American, and Indian-Asian). The vast majority of 
sampled youth reported one race only (97.8%). In addition, 
the NCVS administers a self-reported measure of Hispanic 
origin to determine whether or not a respondent is of 
Hispanic descent, regardless of race.  

Due to the 2003 racial category revisions, a separate code 
was created for the post-2002 NCVS that recoded the twenty 
categories of one race only or two or more races into the 
five original racial groups. The code combined responses to 
the race and Hispanic origin measures to create categories 
representing the three largest racial and ethnic groups in 
the U.S. population: black non-Hispanics, white non-
Hispanics, and Hispanics. The largest racial or ethnic group 
from 1993 to 2010 was white non-Hispanics (60.7%), followed 
by Hispanics (19.3%), black non-Hispanics (15.3%), 
Asian/other Pacific Islander non-Hispanics (4.2%), and 
American Indian or Alaska Native non-Hispanics (0.5%). For 
the purposes of this report, the sample size of the latter 
two groups was insufficient for portraying reliable long-term 
trends in serious violent crime and simple assault.

Household structure
********************

The NCVS uses a household structure code to measure the 
composition of households in the survey. The code broadly 
classifies households into those headed by a married person 
or an unmarried person, and configures each household unit 
according to the presence of children and other relatives 
(e.g., grandparents, siblings, and cousins), and nonrelatives 
(e.g., girlfriends, boyfriends, and friends). 

This classification scheme results in 33 configurations of 
household living arrangements, including a category for other 
combinations not captured by the household structure code. 
These configurations may be recoded into broader categories 
of household structure, including married heads of households 
with or without children, or unmarried heads of households 
with or without children. For the purposes of this report, 
youth household types were coded into two major types: 
married heads of households and unmarried heads of 
households. 

Nearly 69% of youth ages 12 to 17 lived with a married head 
of household, the majority of which were the person’s own 
children (95.1%). The remaining youth residing with a married 
head of household included other relatives (4.2%) and 
nonrelatives (0.7%). Youth living with an unmarried head of 
household comprised 31% of the sample, most being children of 
the unmarried person (83.2%). The remaining 16.8% of youth 
residing with an unmarried head of household included other 
relatives and nonrelatives of the unmarried person. 
Preliminary analyses found no important differences in 
violent victimization between youth living in nuclear (i.e., 
parents and children) and extended (i.e., parents, children, 
and others) household arrangements; therefore, additional 
distinctions among married and unmarried heads of households 
were not made. 

About 1% of youth resided in a household that was either 
unwilling or unable to provide information about household 
living arrangements and was excluded from the analyses 
examining differences across family structure.

************************************
Weighting adjustments for estimating 
household victimization
************************************


Estimates in this report use data from the 1993 to 2010 NCVS 
data files. These files are weighted to produce annual 
estimates of victimization for persons age 12 or older living 
in U.S. households. Because the NCVS relies on a sample 
rather than a census of the entire U.S. population, weights 
are designed to inflate sample point estimates to known 
population totals and to compensate for survey nonresponse 
and other aspects of the sample design. 

The NCVS data files include both person and household 
weights. Person weights provide an estimate of the population 
represented by each person in the sample. Household weights 
provide an estimate of the total U.S. household population. 
Both household and person weights, after proper adjustment, 
are also used to form the denominator in calculations of 
crime rates.

Victimization weights used in this analysis account for the 
number of persons present during an incident and for repeat 
victims of series incidents. The weight counts series 
incidents as the actual number of incidents reported by the 
victim, up to a maximum of 10 incidents. Series 
victimizations are similar in type but occur with such 
frequency that a victim is unable to recall the details of 
each individual event. Survey procedures allow NCVS 
interviewers to identify and classify these similar 
victimizations as series victimizations and to collect 
detailed information on only the most recent incident in the 
series. 

In 2010, about 3% of all victimizations were series 
incidents. Weighting series incidents as the number of 
incidents up to a maximum of 10 incidents produces more 
reliable estimates of crime levels, while the cap at 10 
minimizes the effect of extreme outliers on the rates. 
Additional information on the series enumeration is detailed 
in the report Methods for Counting High Frequency Repeat 
Victimizations in the National Crime Victimization Survey, 
NCJ 237308, BJS website, April 2012.

Trend estimates provided are based on 2-year rolling averages 
centered on the most recent year. For example, estimates 
reported for 2010 represent the average estimate from 2009 to 
2010. This method is used to smooth trend lines and improve 
the reliability of estimates by increasing the sample sizes 
for each annual average estimate. In tables 12, 13, and 15, 
the estimates are based on data pooled from the 1994-02 
period and from the 2002-10 period.

****************************
Standard error computations
****************************

When national estimates are derived from a sample, as is the 
case with the NCVS, caution must be taken when comparing one 
estimate to another estimate or when comparing estimates over 
time. Although one estimate may be larger than another, 
estimates based on a sample have some degree of sampling 
error. The sampling error of an estimate depends on several 
factors, including the amount of variation in the responses, 
the size of the sample, and the size of the subgroup for 
which the estimate is computed. When the sampling error 
around the estimates is taken into consideration, the 
estimates that appear different may, in fact, not be 
statistically different.

One measure of the sampling error associated with an estimate 
is the standard error. The standard error can vary from one 
estimate to the next. In general, for a given metric, an 
estimate with a smaller standard error provides a more 
reliable approximation of the true value than an estimate 
with a larger standard error. Estimates with relatively large 
standard errors are associated with less precision and 
reliability and should be interpreted with caution.

In order to generate standard errors around estimates from 
the NCVS, the Census Bureau produces generalized variance 
function (GVF) parameters for BJS. The GVFs take into account 
aspects of the NCVS complex sample design and represent the 
curve fitted to a selection of individual standard errors 
based on the Jackknife Repeated Replication technique. The 
GVF parameters were used to generate standard errors for each 
point estimate (such as counts, percentages, and rates) in 
the report.

In this report, BJS conducted tests to determine whether 
differences in estimated numbers and percentages were 
statistically significant once sampling error was taken into 
account. Using statistical programs developed specifically 
for the NCVS, all comparisons in the text were tested for 
significance. The primary test procedure used was Student’s 
t-statistic, which tests the difference between two sample 
estimates. To ensure that the observed differences between 
estimates were larger than might be expected due to sampling 
variation, the significance level was set at the 95% 
confidence level.

Data users can use the estimates and the standard errors of 
the estimates provided in this report to generate a 
confidence interval around the estimate as a measure of the 
margin of error. The following example illustrates how 
standard errors can be used to generate confidence intervals:

According to the NCVS, from 2002 to 2010, 43% of serious 
violent crime against youth was reported to police (see table 
12). Using the GVFs, BJS determined that the estimate has a 
standard error of 3.5% (see appendix table 16). A confidence 
interval around the estimate was generated by multiplying the 
standard errors by ±1.96 (the t-score of a normal, two-tailed 
distribution that excludes 2.5% at either end of the 
distribution). Therefore, the confidence interval around the 
43% estimate is equal to 43% ± 3.5% X 1.96 (or 36.1% to 
49.9%). In other words, if different samples using the same 
procedures were taken from the U.S. population from 2002 to 
2010, 95% of the time the percentage of serious violent crime 
against youth reported to police would fall between 36.1% and 
49.9%. 

In this report, BJS also calculated a coefficient of 
variation (CV) for all estimates, representing the ratio of 
the standard error to the estimate. CVs provide a measure of 
reliability and a means to compare the precision of estimates 
across measures with differing levels or metrics. If it was 
the case that the CV was greater than 50%, or the unweighted 
sample had 10 or fewer cases, the estimate would have been 
noted with a “!” symbol (interpret data with caution; 
estimate is based on 10 or fewer sample cases, or the 
coefficient of variation exceeds 50%). 

Many of the variables examined in this report may be related 
to one another and to other variables not included in the 
analyses. Complex relationships among variables were not 
fully explored in this report and warrant more extensive 
analysis. Causal inferences should not be drawn based on the 
results presented.

FBI’s Supplementary Homicide 
Reports (SHR)
************************************

The homicide data in this report are from the FBI’s 
Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), which is a part of the 
Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. Supplemental data 
about homicide incidents are submitted monthly with details 
on location, victim, and offender characteristics. The data 
include information on the reporting agency and its 
residential population, county and Metropolitan Statistical 
Area (MSA) codes, geographic division, and population group; 
on the age, race, and sex of victims and offenders; and on 
the victim-offender relationship, weapon use, and 
circumstance of the crime.

Homicide as defined here includes murder and nonnegligent 
manslaughter, which is the willful killing of one human being 
by another. The general analyses excluded deaths caused by 
negligence, suicide, or accident; justifiable homicides; and 
attempts to murder. Justifiable homicides based on the 
reports of law enforcement agencies are analyzed separately. 
Deaths from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, are 
not included in any of the analyses. These homicide data are 
based solely on police investigation, as opposed to the 
determination of a court, medical examiner, coroner, jury, or 
other judicial body. 

Data used in this report were obtained through the DOJ’s 
Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Protection 
(OJJDP), Easy Access to the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide 
Reports, 1980-2010 (available at: 
http://www.ojjdp.gov/ojstatbb/ezashr/). Not all agencies that 
reported offense information to the FBI also submitted 
supplemental data on homicides. To account for the total 
number of homicides, the OJJDP database weighted the total 
number of homicide victims included in the SHR data to match 
national and state estimates of the total number of homicide 
victims prepared by the FBI. The weighting of victim records 
assumes that if nonreporting agencies did report their data, 
then these data would be similar to that in the reported 
data.
