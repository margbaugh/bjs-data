The total Federal, State, and local adult correctional
population -- incarcerated or in the community --
grew by 150,700 during 2002 to reach a new high of
more than 6.7 million. About 3.1% of the U.S. adult
population, or 1 in every 32 adults, were
incarcerated or on probation or parole at yearend
2002.

A total of 3,995,165 adult men and women were on
probation at yearend 2002, representing a growth of
1.6% during the year. The adult parole population
grew 2.8%, rising to a total of 753,141 by December
31, 2002. Since 1995 the parole population has
been the slowest growing correctional population,
increasing 1.5% annually, compared to jails (4.0%
annually), prisons (3.5%), and probation (3.1%).

Over 4.7 million adult men and women on
probation or parole

At yearend 2002 the number of adult men and women in the 
United States who were being supervised in the community 
reached a record high 4,748,306, up from 3,757,282 on 
December 31, 1995. These data were collected in the 2002 
Annual Probation Survey and the 2002 Annual Parole Survey 
conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).

In 2002 the number of adults under supervision in
the community increased 1.8%, which was less than
the average annual increase of 3.4% since 1995.  

The total adult correctional population, including
those incarcerated and those being supervised in
the community, reached a new high of 6,732,400 at
the end of 2002. At yearend 2002, 3.1%, or about 1
in every 32 adults in the United States, were in State
or Federal prisons, local jails, or under the
supervision of probation or parole authorities, up
from 2.7% in 1995.  

Texas and California led the Nation in number of
adults supervised in the community

More than 1 million persons being supervised in the
community in 2002, or about 1 in 5 probationers and
parolees, were in Texas and California. Texas led
the Nation with 537,561 persons on probation or
parole, followed by California with 471,306.
Washington led the Nation with the largest
percentage of its adult population under community
supervision (3.8% at yearend 2002), followed by
Delaware and Texas (each with 3.4%). California's
community supervision rate of 1.8% was about half
that of Texas.

Ten States reported that fewer than 1% of their adult
populations were on probation or parole. West Virginia 
had the lowest rate of supervision in the community 
(450 offenders per 100,000 adults). 

2 States reported an increase of 10% or more 
in their probation population 

New Mexico reported an increase of 13% and South
Dakota an increase of 11% in the number of adults
on probation during 2002. Thirty-five States reported
an increase in their adult probation populations
during 2002. Ohio had the largest increase (with
16,024 additional persons on probation), followed by
Washington State (7,487) and California (7,353). 

Thirteen States had fewer adults on probation at the
end of 2002 than at the beginning of the year, led by
Idaho, down 12%, the only double-digit decrease
during 2002.

63,434 probationers added in 2002

During 2002 the probation population grew by nearly
63,434, an increase of 1.6%. This was more than
half the increase recorded in 2001 (105,522) and the
second smallest increase since 1995.

At yearend 2002 the probation supervision rate
totaled 1,854 probationers per 100,000 adult U.S.
residents -- the equivalent of 1 in every 54 adults. 
Washington State with 3,819 probationers per
100,000 adult State residents had the highest rate of
probation supervision; New Hampshire (with 387 per
100,000) had the lowest. 

More than 2.1 million adults entered probation
supervision during 2002, an increase of over 18,500
probation entries from 2001. Since 1999 the annual
number of entries to probation, however, has
fluctuated -- increasing in 2000 and then dropping
in 2001.

--------------------------------------------------
At yearend 2002, women comprised 1 in 5
probationers; blacks, 1 in 3 

Nationwide, women represented a slightly larger
percentage of the probation population in 2002 than 
in 1995. Women were 23% of adults on probation in 
2002 (906,600), up from 21% in 1995.

At yearend 2002 more than half of all probationers were
white (2,212,700); a third were black (1,228,300); and 
an eighth were of Hispanic origin (485,600). Persons of 
other races comprised about 2% of probationers (68,700).  

Half of all probationers convicted of a felony;  a
quarter convicted of a drug law violation

Probationers are criminal offenders who have been
sentenced to a period of conditional supervision in the
community. At yearend 2002, 50% had been convicted of
a felony offense.

Sixty percent of probationers had a direct sentence to
probation; 22% had received a sentence to incarceration
that had been suspended; and 9% had received a split
sentence that included incarceration followed by
probation. An additional 10% had entered probation
before completion of all court proceedings (including
those who entered probation before final verdict).

Approximately 3 of every 4 probationers were under
active supervision and were required to regularly report 
to a probation authority in person, by mail, or by 
telephone. The percentage of probationers required to 
report regularly dropped steadily, from 79% in 1995 to 
76% in 2000 and to 75% in 2002.

At yearend 2002 at least 1 in 9 probationers had absconded: 
though still on probation, they had failed to report and 
could not be located. Among all persons on probation, 
absconders increased from 9% in 1995 to 11% in 2002.

In 2002, 24% of probationers had a drug law violation;
17% were sentenced for driving while intoxicated or under
the influence of alcohol; 13% for larceny/theft; and 10%
for other assault, excluding sexual assault and domestic
violence.  Fewer than 10% were sentenced to probation
for burglary (8%), domestic violence (7%), minor traffic
offenses (6%), fraud (5%), and sexual assault (2%).

More than 3 out of 5 of the more than 2 million adults
discharged from probation in 2002 had successfully met
the conditions of their supervision. The percentage of
probationers discharged from probation supervision
because of incarceration due to a rule violation or new
offense dropped steadily, from 21% in 1995 to 15% in
2000 and to 14% in 2002. Another 3% of those discharged
had absconded, and 13% had their probation sentence
revoked without incarceration.
-----------------------------------------------

Parole growth in 2002 almost double average
annual growth since 1995

Also serving time in the community at the end of
2002 were 753,141 adults on parole. Parole is a
period of conditional supervised release following a
prison term. Prisoners may be released to parole
either by a parole board decision or by mandatory
conditional release.

The 2.8% growth in parole during 2002 -- a net
increase of 20,808 parolees -- was almost double
the average annual increase of 1.5% in parole since
1995. This was also the largest increase in the
parole population since 1995. Nearly all parolees
had been convicted of a felony (96%).

Double-digit increases in parole populations reported by 
12 States For the year ending December 31, 2002, 12 
States reported an increase of 10% or more in their parole
population. North Dakota led with 27%, followed by
three other States exceeding 20%: New Mexico (26%),
Kentucky (23%), and Oklahoma (21%).

A total of 18 States reported a decrease in their adult
parole population during 2002. Washington State's
decrease of 39% for the year ending December 31,
was followed by three other States with a decrease
of 10% or more: South Carolina (down 14%), Florida
(down 13%), and Vermont (down 11%).

 Women accounted for more than 1 of every 7
adults on parole in 2002 

About 1 of every 7 adults on parole in 2002
(108,200) were women.  The female parole
population has increased steadily: from 10% in 1995
to 12% in 2000 to 14% in 2002. 

About 42% of adults on parole on December 31, 2002,
were black (313,800); 39% were white (292,400).  Almost
1 in 5 parolees were Hispanic (136,600). About 1% were
of other races (10,400).  

Mandatory releases to parole have risen since
1995
 
Discretionary releases of prisoners to parole
supervision by a parole board have decreased from
50% of adults entering parole in 1995 to 39%, or
174,600, in 2002. Mandatory releases to parole
supervision increased from 45% in 1995 to 52%
(234,000) in 2002.

At yearend 2002 more than 4 of every 5 parolees
were under active supervision and were required to
maintain regular contact with the paroling agency.
About 8% of parolees were absconders and could
not be located.

More than 2 of every 5 parolees discharged from
supervision returned to incarceration 

Of the nearly 448,000 parolees discharged from
supervision in 2002, 45% had successfully met the
conditions of their supervision. The success rate 
among those discharged from parole remained fairly 
stable after 1995 (45% in 1995, 43% in 2000, and 45% 
in 2002). 

Of those parolees discharged in 2002, 41% had been
returned to incarceration either because of a rule 
violation or new offense. Another 9% had absconded, 
and 2% had failed to successfully meet the conditions 
of supervision but were discharged without incarceration.  

Correctional supervision rate highest in Texas and
lowest in New Hampshire

Texas led the Nation at yearend 2002 with 4,682 adults
under correctional supervision per 100,000 adult State
residents, followed by Delaware (4,557), Idaho (4,396),
and Washington State (4,348). New Hampshire (960 per
100,000), West Virginia (980), and North Dakota (1,055)
had the fewest adults on probation or parole or in prison
or jail relative to their State populations.

Offenders on probation or parole represented nearly 71%
of all persons under correctional supervision at yearend. 
The 10 States with the highest rates of correctional
supervision were also the 10 States with the highest 
rates of probation supervision.  

Minnesota with 3,654 persons under supervision per
100,000 adult residents had the lowest percentage
incarcerated (8.9% of all persons under supervision).
Other States with a low percentage incarcerated included
Vermont (with 11%), Rhode Island (with 13%), and
Washington State (with 14%). Mississippi with 59% of its
correctional population incarcerated had the highest
percentage among States, followed by West Virginia and
Virginia (54%).

Methodology

The Annual Probation and Parole Surveys provide a
count of the total number of persons supervised in
the community on January 1 and December 31, 2002, and 
a count of the number entering and leaving supervision 
during the year. These surveys cover all 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, and the Federal system. The first 
annual report on probation and parole appeared in 1979.

Data for the Federal system are from the Administrative 
Office of the U.S. Courts as provided to the BJS Federal 
Justice Statistics Program.

Because many States update their population counts, the 
January 1, 2002, numbers may differ from those previously 
published for December 31, 2001.

Probation  

The 2002 Annual Probation Survey was sent to 473
respondents -- 36 central State reporters and 437
separate State, county, or court agencies. States
with multiple reporters were Alabama (3), Arizona
(2), Colorado (9), Florida (44), Georgia (5), Idaho 
(2), Kentucky (3), Michigan (130), Missouri (2), New
Mexico (2), Ohio (186), Oklahoma (3), Tennessee
(3), Washington (35), and West Virginia (2). Two
local agencies (one in Michigan and one in
Washington) did not provide data. For these
agencies, the 12/31/01 population count was used
as the 1/1/02 and 12/31/02 counts. 

Since 1997 the survey coverage has been expanded
to include 186 additional agencies. At yearend 2002,
186,497 probationers were under the supervision of
these agencies. For year-to-year comparisons, use
total counts based on the same reporting agencies
-- 3,266,837 in 1997 to compare with the final 1996
counts; 3,417,613 in 1998 to compare with final
1997; and 3,772,773 in 1999 to compare with final
1998. 

Entries to probation supervision were estimated for
nonreporting agencies beginning in 1999. Reported
entries for the period were as follows: 1,851,711 
in 1999, 1,963,414 in 2000, 1,918,640 in 2001 and
1,888,485 in 2002.  

Parole  

The 2002 Annual Parole Survey was sent to 54
respondents, including 52 central reporters, the
California Youth Authority, and 1 municipal agency. 
States with multiple reporters were Alabama (2) and
California (2). One State agency, Massachusetts,
was unable to provide data. For this agency, the
12/31/01 population count was used as the 1/1/02
and 12/31/02 counts. 

Federal parole as defined here includes supervised
release, parole, military parole, special parole,
and mandatory release.
