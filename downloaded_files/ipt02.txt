Highlights

Criminal matters referred to U.S. attorneys with an 
intellectual property (IP)offense, 1994-2002

Civil intellectual property suits filed in U.S. 
district courts, 1994-2002

Criminal enforcement

*  The number of suspects referred to U.S. attorneys with an IP theft-related
lead charge increased 26% from 1994 to 2002. The number of defendants
convicted in U.S. district court with an IP offense increased 51% over this
same period (89 in 1994 to 134 in 2002).

*  During 2002, 88% of defendants with an IP offense as their most serious
offense were convicted. Less than half(43%)of those convicted received prison
time. The median prison term imposed was 15 months.

*  More than half of defendants sentenced for copyright/trademark infringement
had stolen IP worth over $70,000. One in three defendants received a fine as
part of their sentence (median $2,000).

Civil litigation

*  From 1994 to 2002 the number of cases in which plaintiffs sought civil
remedies related to patent, trademark, and copyright infringement increased
20% to 8,254. The growth was due largely to increases in patent and 
trademark cases filed between private parties.

*  Less than 2% of the 7,445 civil IP disputes disposed in 2002 were resolved
by a trial verdict (140).

*  83 of the 140 plaintiffs in IP cases disposed of by a trial verdict won,
and of these 83, 53 received a monetary settlement. The median award
amount in 2002 was $965,000. The median awards by nature of suit
were: $84,500 for trademark, $159,000 for copyright, and $2.3 million 
for patent suits.
----------------------------------------------

Intellectual property-related (IP) cases are handled as both civil and
criminal matters in Federal court. During 2002, 134 defendants were
sentenced for IP infringement offenses under the U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines with more than half convicted of stealing IP worth over
$70,000.***Footnote 1:  Defendants sentenced under copyright/trademark
infringement (sec.2B5.3)as primary guideline.*** Also in 2002, 8,254 
civil cases related to intellectual property theft were filed in U.S. 
district courts (up 20% from 1994).

Suspects with copyright violation as the lead charge comprised more than 
half (52%) of criminal IP referrals to U.S attorneys in 2002; 25% were
referred with trademark offenses; and 22%, with trade secret offenses.
Eighty-eight percent of defendants adjudicated with IP theft as the most
serious terminating offense in 2002 were convicted. 

Forty-two percent of the 8,254 civil IP complaints filed in U.S. district
court during 2002 were trademark suits; 33% were patent-related; and
25% were for copyright infringement. The U.S. Government was plaintiff
or defendant in 32 civil cases filed in U.S. district court during 2002 
for patent(20)and trademark (12) complaints. 

Criminal IP offenses include the trafficking of goods with counterfeit
trademarks or brands (such as clothing and consumer electronics),
software piracy, the distribution of bootleg musical recordings and
movies, selling company trade secrets, and derivative copyright violations
of intercepting cable/satellite broadcasts. Recent Federal legislation
prohibits use of the Internet or other communication technology to
distribute pirated intellectual property. Recent laws have targeted
counterfeit manufacturing operations, both domestic and international.
This report uses data from the Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP)
and other sources to describe the enforcement of intellectual property
rights in the Federal criminal and civil justice systems including private
civil remedies.

Criminal enforcement

From 1994 to 2002, 3,395 suspects were referred to U.S. attorneys for
an intellectual property offense as the lead charge. This is under 1% of
the more than 1 million total Federal suspects referred to U.S. attorneys
over the 9-year period. The number of suspects investigated for an
intellectual property offense increased 26% from 322 in 1994 to 405 in
2002 (peaking in 2001 at 455: Highlights figure). The number of suspects
in matters referred to U.S. attorneys for copyright offenses increased
47% (from 143 in 1994 to 210 in 2002), surpassing trademark offenses,
which decreased 42% (179 in 1994 to 103 in 2002). Following passage
of the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, the number of suspects referred
for trade secret offenses increased more than threefold from 28 in 1997 
to 92 in 2002.

------------------------------------------------------
Protecting intellectual property

Intellectual property (IP) rights are rooted in copyright and patent
protections in the U.S. Constitution.***Footnote 1: Article I, Sec. 8, cl. 
8.*** As intellectual property grew more important in the U.S. economy,
making it an attractive target for individual and organized criminals,
Federal lawmakers codified IP protections.

Federal legislation targets the use of the Internet and other communication
devices used in reproducing/distributing IP material and the importation of
counterfeit merchandise. Congress strengthened civil penalties (the primary
remedy for IP offenses/disputes) and established new criminal statutes
providing penalties that include imprisonment and fines tied to the estimated
value of infringed goods.

Trademark

The Lanham Act of 1946 codified civil law  into a national system of
trademark protections.***Footnote 2: 15 U.S.C. sec. 1051-1127.*** The
act provides for the registration and enforcement of trademarks and
prohibits counterfeit merchandise from being imported into the
U.S.***Footnote 3:  19 C.F.R. Part 133 (1995). *** The Trademark
Counterfeiting Act of 1984 made trafficking in goods and services using
a counterfeit trademark a felony (18 U.S.C. sec. 2320) and strengthened
civil remedies to allow for statutory and treble damages and attorney
fees. It also permitted the destruction of articles bearing counterfeit
marks.***Footnote 4: Pub. L. No. 98-473, II sec. 1502(a), 98 Stat. 2178
(1984).***

Trade secrets

The Economic Espionage Act (EAA) of 1996 created the first criminal statutes
specifically aimed at the theft of trade secrets. Two crimes were codified
including: "economic espionage" (18 U.S.C. sec. 1831)prohibiting theft of
valued, proprietary information for the benefit of a foreign government and
"theft of trade secrets" (18 U.S.C. sec. 1832)which more generally includes
offenses involving the conversion of a trade secret for economic benefit,
whether foreign or domestic, a company or an individual.***Footnote 5: Pub. 
L. No. 104-294, 110 Stat.3488.***

The act also authorized the Attorney General to enforce civil actions (18
U.S.C. sec. 1834) and ensure forfeiture of property used in the offense.

Copyright

The first criminal provision in copyright laws, passed in 1897, made it a
misdemeanor to perform dramas or music willfully and for profit without
copyright owner's permission.***Footnote 6:  The Act of January 6, 1897
(54th Congress, 2d Session, 29 Stat. 481).***   The Copyright Act of 1976
provided the basic framework for today's copyright laws. It also made
infringement (for purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain) a
misdemeanor offense and stiffened penalties for repeat offenders. The act
created Federal preemption of copyright criminal remedies (eliminating most
recourse to State criminal laws).***Footnote 7: Pub. L. No. 94-553, 101, 90
Stat. 2451, 2586; 17 U.S.C. sec. 506(a).*** In 1982 Congress passed The 
Piracy and Counterfeiting Amendments Act, making mass infringement of movies
and records a felony.***Footnote 8: Pub. L. No. 97-180, 96 Stat. 91, 92; 18
U.S.C. sec. 2319(b).*** The Copyright Felony Act of 1992 targeted the mass
reproduction of computer  software and made copyright infringement involving
10 or more copies (value over $2,500) a felony.***Footnote 9: Pub. L. No.
102-561, 106 Stat. 4233; 18 U.S.C. sec. 2319(b).*** The unauthorized recording
of live musical recordings or "bootlegging" was made criminal in 1994 (18
U.S.C. sec. 2319A). The Anti-Counterfeiting Consumer Protection Act of 1996
made trademark and copyright counterfeiting predicate offenses under the
Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) statutes (18 U.S.C.
Sec.sec. 1961-1968).***Footnote 10: Pub. L. No. 104-153, 110 Stat. 1386.***
More recently, the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act made distributing
copyrighted materials (that is, over the Internet) a Federal crime (total
retail value of $1,000).***Footnote 11:  Pub. L. No. 105-147, 111 Stat.
2678; 17 U.S.C. sec. 506(a).*** Further, the NET Act spurred changes to
the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, stiffening sanctions for IP theft
offenders.***Footnote 12:  U.S. Sentencing Commission, USSG Appendix C.,
Amendment 590, May 1, 2000, promulgated in response to Pub. L. 105-147. 
Sec. 2(g).*** The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), enacted in 
1998, established criminal penalties for circumventing copyright 
protection systems.***Footnote 13:  Pub. L. No.105-304, 112 Stat. 2860; 
17 U.S.C. sec. 506(a).***

In 2002 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported 
nearly 5,800 seizures of IP worth over $99 million

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) seizes illegal intellectual property
at 317 U.S. ports of entry.***The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296)
created the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) by merging most
of U.S. Customs with immigration inspectors from the former Immigration and
Naturalization Service, the Border Patrol, and agricultural border inspectors
from the Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection
Service. The CBP took effect on March 1, 2003, under the newly created
Department of Homeland Security (DHS). *** Ports of entry are locales
designated for the movement of merchandise and people in and out of the
country. Customs has the authority to determine trademark and copyright
violations, to search and seize property, and to arrest suspects. (See the
Tariff Act.)

The number of Customs' seizures increased 177% from 2,091 in 1995 to
5,793 in 2002 (not shown in table). In 2002 counterfeit cigarettes were
38% of all CPB seizures, followed by media (movies, software, and
music) at 29%,and watches, consumer electronics, apparel, and
handbags at 21%. Among exporting countries of origin, China accounted
for a quarter of all seizures and half of the total value seized in 2002.
Cigarettes made up 75% of the seizures from China. Taiwanese IP comprised 
less than 2% of seizures and 27% of the total value (media being 88% of 
seized material). 
-----------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------
Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (CHIP) prosecution units 

By fiscal year-end 2002, the Attorney General had designated Federal
CHIP prosecution units in 13 U.S. cities. CHIP units specialize in the
enforcement of a wide range of intellectual property theft including
copyright and trademark violations, theft of computer components, theft
of trade secrets and economic espionage. They also specialize in
prosecuting computer hacking, fraud, and other Internet crimes. Cities
were selected based on concentrations of high tech industries and other
likely targets of IP theft or computer crimes.

The CHIP units work with the FBI and other investigatory agencies to
foster relationships with the technology community for enforcement
efforts. The units also train members of Federal, State, and local law
enforcement agencies in detection of cybercrime and intellectual property
theft.

Source: Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS), U.S.
Department of Justice.
---------------------------------------------

The Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS) in the
Criminal Division of Justice oversees the Federal prosecution of IP theft
and advises on policies related to infrastructure protection and global IP
theft enforcement. CCIPS also supports the CHIP program.***Footnote 2: The
U.S. Attorney General announced the creation of the Intellectual Property 
Task Force in March 2004 to strengthen IP theft enforcement. The task force
focuses attention on coun-tering international piracy and counterfeiting by
organized crime.***

--------------------------------------------
Commercial suspects of IP theft  In 2002 businesses were 9% of suspects 
(37) referred to U.S. attorneys for an IP offense. During 1994 businesses
comprised 12% of the suspects referred to U.S. attorneys with IP theft as 
lead charge. As IP theft referrals increased over 9 years, the number of
organizational suspects remained about the same (38 in 1994; 37 in 2002).
Three organizations were adjudicated for an IP offense in 2002 (one for a
copyright offense and two for trademark offenses), and two were convicted 
(one organization received a 12-month term of supervision and the other, a
suspended sentence).
-------------------------------------------

In 2002 more than 15 Federal, State, and local agencies provided referrals to
U.S. attorneys for IP theft. The majority were from agencies of Treasury and
Justice. The FBI, with primary authority to investigate IP theft, referred
63% of suspects to U.S. attorneys, followed by the U.S. Customs Service
(23%) (USCS). Following the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the USCS is made 
up of the CBP, which monitors the movement of merchandise and people into 
and out of the country (text box on page 3), and the U.S. Immigration and
Customs Enforcement (ICE), which conducts intelligence and investigations
pertaining to IP smuggling. Various agencies made up the remaining 14% of
referrals in 2002 (including the Secret Service and the U.S. Postal Service).

From 1994 to 2002, 32% of IP matters were referred from seven Federal
judicial districts. These districts were the Central and Northern Districts
of California (7% and 6%, respectively), the Southern and Eastern Districts 
of New York (5% and 3%, respectively), the Middle District of Florida (5%),
and the Northern and Southern Districts of Texas (3% each).

Matters prosecuted

The number of suspects prosecuted for IP theft by U.S. attorneys increased 
41% from 129 in 1994 to 182 in 2002. In 2002, 48% of 383 suspects in matters
concluded with an IP theft offense as lead charge were prosecuted in U.S.
district courts -- a slightly greater share than in 1994 (46%). Suspects
referred for copyright offenses (56%) were more likely than trademark (50%) 
or trade secret (22%) suspects to be prosecuted in 2002.

The most common reasons given by U.S. attorneys for declining to prosecute 
in 2002 were weak/insufficient admissible evidence (20%), agency request
(17%), lack of evidence of criminal intent (12%), and civil/administrative
action/prosecution by other authorities (11%). Twenty-three suspects in IP
matters concluded in 2002 were organizational defendants (6%); three were
prosecuted in U.S. district courts (see text box above).  

Criminal case outcomes

Eighty-eight percent of criminal defendants with an IP offense as their
most serious offense at case conclusion were convicted in 2002. This is
comparable to the overall conviction rate of 89% for the 80,000 criminal
defendants adjudicated in 2002. Ninety-three percent of copyright
defendants, 85% of adjudicated trademark offenders, and 75% of trade
secret offenders were convicted in 2002 (not shown in table).

During 2002, 72% of IP theft offenses were disposed within 1 year (time
from case filing to disposition). The mean for all IP offenses was 10.6
months (not shown in table).  

IP defendants sentenced under the U.S. 
Sentencing Guidelines 

The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 eliminated parole, restricted good time 
that could be earned, and authorized the U.S. Sentencing Commission to 
create guidelines that consider a broad variety of factors. The guidelines
take into account offense-specific characteristics which are scored and 
used to determine sentencing ranges.

The number of defendants sentenced for IP theft (as primary guideline)
increased 54% from 1995-2002 (87 in 1995 to 134 in 2002) peaking at
137 in 1998. During 2002, 141 defendants were sentenced for IP theft as
a primary or secondary guideline. The bulk (134 or 95%) of defendants
convicted of IP theft in 2002 were sentenced with IP theft as the primary
guideline. In 2002 IP theft offenders comprised less than 1% of the
64,366 defendants sentenced under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.

During 2002 sentenced defendants were predominantly male(93%),white(65%) 
or Asian (15%), 35 or older (60%), U.S. citizens (78%), and college 
educated (50% with some college or a degree). Three-fourths of defendants 
did not have prior convictions used in determining sentence. Relatively 
more males, whites, persons under age 35, and persons with some college 
(or graduate) were convicted of IP offenses in 2002 than in 1998. A similar
percentage of IP defendants convicted in 2002 pleaded guilty (97%) as in 
1998(96% pleaded guilty). 

In response to the NET Act of 1997, the USSC modified the IP theft
guidelines (effective May 1, 2000). The USSC increased the base offense
score for IP theft from 6 to 8, added three offense-specific
characteristics, and changed the definition of value of infringed IP from
being based on the value of counterfeit goods to being based on the
legitimate retail value of infringed items. For example, prior to the 2000
amendment, if an offender sold 10 fake name brand watches at $35 each, when
the retail value of a legitimate watch was $1,000, the loss calculation 
would be $350 (‘value of infringing items'). Under the post-2000 guidelines,
the total loss calculation would be $10,000 (based on the retail value of
legitimate watches or ‘infringment amount').  

During 2002 more than half of IP theft defendants were convicted with an
infringement value of over $70,000. Given the change in the definition of
IP loss effective in 2000, the loss value for most IP defendants sentenced
in 2002 was calculated as the legitimate retail value of infringed
goods.***Footnote 3:  In 2001 USSC also amended the IP theft guidelines
(§2B5.3) to include a new loss table that associates increased offense 
levels with most loss amount categories. The combined effect of this 
amendment and the new loss definition has increased the severity of
sanctions for IP theft. *** 

During 2002,13 of the 15 defendants in cases with infringement amounts
of over $2.5 million did not have a prior criminal history(that is, prior
convictions used for computation of sentence)(not shown in table).

In 2002,10 defendants sentenced under the IP theft guideline (7.5%)
received an adjustment for abuse of position of trust. Ten defendants
(7.5%) received an adjustment for an organizing or managing role in the
offense, down slightly from 11% in 1998. Six percent of defendants
received a mitigating adjustment for their minimal/minor participation in
the offense (down slightly from 9.5% in 1998). Almost all IP defendants
sentenced in 1998(93%) and 2002(96%) accepted responsibility for
their crime.

Forty-one (46%) of the 92 defendants sentenced under post-May 2000
amendments received an aggravated adjustment to their sentence for
manufacturing, importing, or uploading infringing items to the Internet 
(for example, causing goods to enter stream of commerce)(not shown in
table).

---------------------------------------------
Trademark, copyright, and patent protections

Trademarks are brand names distinguishing manufactured goods. Registration
with the U.S. Patents and Trademark Office establishes Federal jurisdiction 
in a criminal prosecution. From 1983 to 2001 registrations increased 148%
(41,200 in 1983 to 102,300 in 2001). 

Copyright registration establishes ownership in criminal and civil
infringement deliberations. From 1983 to 2001, the number of
registrations increased from 1983 to a peak of 663,700 in 1991 and then
decreased to 601,700 in 2001. From 1990 to 2002, copyright registrations
increased for monographs (including computer software and machine
readable works), decreased for serials and musical works (including
dramatic works, accompanying music and motion pictures), and remained at 
about the same level for sound recordings and works of visual arts 
(including fine and graphic art and photographs). The number of patents
granted increased by 197% from 62,000 in 1983 to 184,000 in 2001. Unlike
trademark and copyright laws, U.S. patents are enforceable only against
infringements occurring in the United States.
-------------------------------------------

Most defendants were sentenced within the guideline range in 2002 (59%); 
31% received a downward adjustment for providing substantial assistance 
to the prosecution; and 11% received a downward departure for other 
reasons. IP defendants were less apt to be sentenced within the guidelines 
in 2002 (59%)***Foontnote 4: See appendix table 1 for differences by the
guideline amendment year applied for defendants*** sentenced in FY 2002. 
than in 1998 (72%), attributable in part to increased use of substantial
assistance (20% of cases received in 1998 compared to 31% in 2002) and 
other downward departures (4% in 1998 compared to 11% in 2002). 

Forty-three percent of defendants received some prison time in 2002, up
from 34% in 1998. In 2002 a smaller share of defendants (29%) received
probation only, compared to 1998 (42%), and a greater share received
probation with confinement(27% in 2002 and 24% in 1998).

Of the 134 IP theft defendants sentenced in 2002, 58 (43%) received some
imprisonment with a term ranging from 1 to 46 months and a median of 15
months. In 1998, 34% of defendants were sentenced to prison with a range 
of 1 to 30 months and median of 10 months. Fifty-seven percent received
probation as some part of their sentence in 2002 and 35% of defendants
received a fine in 2002(compared to 47% in 1998). Restitution was ordered 
for 37 (28%) defendants in 2002 (amounts imposed ranged from $600 to $10
million with a median of $25,200).  

Civil litigation

Civil remedies can include injunctions used to halt further infringement,
forfeiture, or monetary relief to include a defendant's profits, damages
sustained, costs of actions, and trebled damages. In 2002 a total of
274,841 civil cases were filed in U.S. district courts (up 9.5% from 2001).
The scope of civil IP cases differs from criminal as it includes patent but
excludes trade secret offenses. The 8,254 IP cases filed comprised 3%
of this total in 2002. IP case filings increased 20% from 1994 to 2002
(6,902 to 8,254). From 1994 to 2002 patent filings grew at the greatest
rate (67%), followed by trademark filings (42%). Copyright filings
decreased 26%.

Between 1994 and 2002 the number of intellectual property complaints
between private parties increased 20% (from 6,872 in 1994 to 8,222 in
2002) due to increases in patent and trademark filings (up 67% and 42%,
respectively). Copyright complaints decreased 26% (from 2,828 in 1994
to 2,084 in 2002).

U.S attorneys have authority to pursue civil litigation on behalf of the
United States. In 2002 the United States Government was plaintiff or
defendant in 32 intellectual property complaints filed (63% patent and
37% trademark cases). 

In 2002, 7,445 copyright, patent, and trademark suits were disposed of
(down 5% from 2001). Federal judicial districts with the largest share of
cases included the Central and Northern Districts of California (13% and
5%, respectively), the Southern District of New York (9%), and the
Northern District of Illinois (5%).
 
Most civil cases were dismissed (76%), rather than disposed of by judgment
(24%) (table 7). Overall, 40% were settled, 22% were voluntarily dismissed,
and 22% received judgment other than trial (such as judgment on default,
consent, motion before trial, and award of arbitrator). Less than 2% of 
cases were disposed by trial verdict.

Among types of IP offenses, patent (3.2%) suits were more likely than
copyright (1.5%) and trademark (1.2%) suits to terminate with a trial
verdict. Copyright suits were slightly more likely to end in settlement
(42%). Of the 140 IP cases terminated by trial verdict in U.S. district
courts in 2002, patent cases comprised 52% (73); trademark cases, 28%
(39); and copyright cases, 20% (28). 

Of the 140 complaints terminated by trial, 61% were disposed of by jury
verdict, 35% by decision of judge or magistrate, and 4% by directed
verdict. Juries decided 69% of patent trials, 64% of copyright trials, 
and 46% of trademark trials. 

During 2002 plaintiffs were winners in 59% (83) of the 140 cases
terminated by trial. Of the 83 plaintiff winners, 52% (43) were patent
cases, 19% (16) copyright cases, and 29% (24) trademark cases. 

Of the 83 plaintiff winners, 53 (64%) received a monetary award. The
median award was $965,000 with 42% less than $500,000, 31% between
$500,000 and $5 million, and 27% greater than $5 million. Monetary
awards varied by type of IP suit: The median award for patent suits was
$2.3 million, followed by copyright ($159,000) and trademark ($84,500)
suits. 

The median case processing time (from case filing to disposition) for all
IP theft cases terminated in 2002 was 7 months. Median case processing
time varied by type of IP complaint: patent (9 months), copyright(7 months),
and trademark (6 months) cases.

Property associated with the IP offense is subject to civil forfeiture
pursuant to civil forfeiture statutes unique to IP theft and as a predicate
offense to money laundering under 18 U.S.C. sec. 981. The CPB can seize,
forfeit, and destroy imported products which violate copyright infringement
(see 17 U.S.C. sec. 603(c)), trafficking in bootleg musical performance
recordings (18 U.S.C. sec. 2319A(c)), and trademark infringing products (19
U.S.C. sec. 1526(e)). Criminal forfeiture is mandatory for trafficking in
counterfeit labels (18 U.S.C. sec. 2318)and for copyright infringement can
include all copies of infringing articles as well as the equipment used to
manufacture items after court order following judgment of conviction (see 17
U.S.C. sec. 506(b)).

Methodology

The source of the data used in this report is the BJS Federal Justice
Statistics Program (FJSP) database. The FJSP compiles comprehensive
information on individuals and corporations processed through the Federal
justice system from source files provided by the Executive Office for 
United States Attorneys (EOUSA), the Administrative Office of the United
States Courts (AOUSC), the United States Sentencing Commission(USSC), and
other agencies. 

In this report, intellectual property offenders were defined according to
selected Federal criminal statutes. (See textbox on page 9.) For suspects 
in matters referred to U.S. attorneys, the "lead charge" is the basis for
investigation and for which at least 1 hour of investigation time was spent.
As secondary charges are not available, IP theft is undercounted to the 
extent it is present as a secondary charge. In table 2 and figure 3,
organizational suspects were manually identified in the Executive Office 
for the U.S. Attorneys central system file by inspecting the name field on
suspects in matters referred from 1994-2002 with an IP statute as the lead
charge.

AOUSC data were used to describe the distribution of IP theft defendants in
cases adjudicated resulting in conviction. The "most serious terminating
offense" designation is the offense that yields the maximum statutory 
penalty. For more information see the methodology section in the Compendium 
of Federal Justice Statistics, 2002 (NCJ 205368). 

The USSC provided data on IP defendants convicted and sentenced under the
Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. The primary guideline (sec.2B5.3) was used to
describe defendants as it provided the largest and most representative group
of defendants sentenced for IP theft. The guideline, sec. 2B5.3, includes 
each of the criminal IP theft statutes listed on page 9 with exception of
theft of trade secrets (18 U.S.C. sec. 1831) and economic espionage 
(18 U.S.C. sec. 1832) offenses. These IP offenses are included under the
general theft guideline (sec.2B1.1).

IP theft defendants sentenced under the guidelines were compared from 1998
and 2002 as these years represented two periods of comparable size as well 
as points before and after the 2000 guideline amendment to sec.2B5.3. As 
about a third of IP defendants convicted in 2002 were sentenced under pre-
2000 amendments to the §2B5.3 guideline, appendix table 1 was included to 
show the break-out by amendment year. The cut-points used in describing 
loss amounts were the categories which could be collapsed across years of
data. The November 1, 2001 guideline amendment changed loss categories and
this affected direct comparison with previous years.

The source of civil data presented in this report is the Federal Judicial
Center's Integrated Data Base (Civil). The database is derived from data
provided by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC). The 
Federal intellectual property categories used in this report are based on 
the codes established by the Administrative Office of the United States 
Courts(AOUSC). For cases that involved more than one filed action, the 
most definitive (as determined by the plaintiff's attorney) is recorded, 
and it is this nature of suit code that was used in the analysis for this
report.
