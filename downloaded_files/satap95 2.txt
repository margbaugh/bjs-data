Highlights

Half of probationers were under the influence of alcohol or drugs
at the time of the offense for which they were convicted

*  Over two-thirds of probationers reported using drugs in the
past; nearly a third reported use in the month before the
current offense.

*  A third of probationers reported a prior binge drinking
experience; a quarter exhibited indicators of past alcohol
dependence or abuse; a fifth were on probation for a DWI offense.

*  Overall, about two-thirds of probationers may be
characterized as alcohol- or drug-involved offenders.

*  Among those probationers who said they used drugs in the
month before their offense, 42% had received drug treatment on
their current sentence.  Nearly a third had received outpatient
care; a quarter participated in a self-help group.

*  Nearly two-thirds of probationers who said they were under
the influence of alcohol during the offense had been treated for
alcohol abuse while on probation; half had participated in
Alcoholics Anonymous.

*  Half of probationers surveyed said they had been tested for
drug use
---------------------------------------------------

In the first national survey of adults on probation, conducted
in 1995, nearly 70% of probationers reported past drug use; 32%
said they were using illegal drugs in the month before their
offense; and 14% were on drugs when they committed their
offense.  More than 20% were on probation for driving under the
influence of drugs or alcohol, and 25% of other probationers
said they had been drinking at the time of their offense.

When the survey was conducted, 17% of probationers reported
having participated in a drug treatment program while serving
their current sentence; 32% said they had received treatment for
alcohol abuse.  Overall, 38% had received some treatment for
substance abuse since beginning their probation. 

These findings are based on personal interviews with a
nationally representative sample of over 2,000 adult
probationers under active supervision.  These interviews
followed an earlier study of administrative records of a larger
sample of probationers.  While the interviews addressed a broad
range of issues, this report focuses on items dealing with
probationers' histories of drug and alcohol use and treatment.

Probationers over half of the Nation's correctional population
---------------------------------------------------

Probationers are criminal offenders who are sentenced to
supervised release into the community.  (Parolees are also
supervised in the community, but only after serving an
incarceration sentence.)  Probation represents a more moderate
sanction than incarceration.  It is generally given to those
offenders with few or no prior convictions or to those guilty of
less serious offenses.  Restrictions placed on probationers'
lives in the community can range from a monthly phone call for
verifying their residence and employment status to the use of
electronic bracelets to enforce house arrest.  

On December 31, 1996 (the most recent data available), there
were nearly 3.2 million adult U.S. residents sentenced to
probation.  This represented 58% of the national population of
adults under correctional supervision, which includes State and
Federal prisoners, local jail inmates, and parolees.  About 78%
of probationers were classified as actively supervised, being 
required to make contact with their probation officer at regular
intervals. 

Since 1990, the probation population has increased by over
500,000 persons, which represents a 19% increase.  The remainder
of the Nation's correctional populations recorded a 40% increase
over the same period.  As a result, the probation population
represents a declining share of the Nation's correctional
population, despite its own substantial growth.  (See
Correctional Populations in the United States, 1995, BJS report,
May 1997, NCJ-163916.)

The Survey of Adults on Probation, 1995, the first of its kind
---------------------------------------------------

The 1995 Survey of Adults on Probation, conducted by the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS), was the first national survey to
gather information on the individual characteristics of
probationers.  The initial component of this survey, a review of
the administrative records of 5,867 adult probationers, provided
detailed information on current offenses and sentences, criminal
histories, levels of supervision and contacts, and disciplinary
hearings and outcomes.  (See Characteristics of Adults on
Probation, 1995, BJS Special Report, December 1997, 
NCJ-164267.)   

From the records-check sample, 4,703 probationers were selected
for personal interviews, which made up the second survey
component.  Because probationers on inactive supervision were
excluded from the personal interview sample, the personal
interview component represents a somewhat smaller share of the
Nation's probationers (2,065,896) than the records check
(2,620,560).  (See Methodology, page 13, for additional
details.) 

Conducted in probation offices, these interviews covered a broad
range of issues, including current offenses and sentences,
socioeconomic characteristics, criminal histories, and mental
health treatment.  This report draws exclusively on the items
concerning experiences with alcohol and drug abuse and treatment
programs.  (See figure 1 for some of the interview items used in
this report.)

of alcohol dependence, another key measure of alcohol abuse used in this
report.

Figure 1.

Results from the personal interview component of the Survey of
Adults on Probation represent the first national data collected
on drug abuse and treatment in the probation population.  The
items regarding prior experiences with alcohol and drug abuse
and treatment programs drew on earlier work conducted by the
National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.  Items on
treatment programs were organized by 19 different types of
programs, whether the treatment was for alcohol, drugs, or both
and whether it was received before, during, or both before and
during the current sentence.

---------------------------------------------------
Almost half of probationers were under the influence of alcohol
or drugs at the time of their offense
---------------------------------------------------

An estimated 47% of all adult probationers said they were under
the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of their offense
(table 1).  Probationers sentenced for driving while intoxicated
(DWI) made up a fifth of all probationers, and 98% confirmed
they committed the offense while under the influence of alcohol
or drugs.  In contrast, the reported percentage among all
non-DWI offenders was 33%.


With the exclusion of DWI probationers, violent offenders (44%)
were the most likely to have used alcohol or drugs at the time
of offense.  The percentage for drug offenders was slightly
lower (38%), while the reported alcohol and drug use of property
offenders (23%) was about half that of violent offenders.   

After DWI offenders, probationers sentenced for burglary (49%)
and assault (48%) reported the highest incidence of alcohol or
drug use at the time of the offense.  Probationers sentenced for
fraud (13%) and larceny/theft (21%) were the least likely to
report such drug and alcohol use.

Local jail inmates (36%) and State prisoners (31%) were about 
twice as likely as probationers (14%) to report drug use at 
the time of offense.  However, the percentage of probationers 
reporting alcohol use at the time of offense (40%) was comparable 
to those of both jail (41%) and State prison (32%) inmates.

Correctional Facilities.

---------------------------------------------------
Over two-thirds of probationers said they used drugs in the past
---------------------------------------------------

While 14% of probationers said they had used drugs at the time
of offense, 69% had used drugs at some time in the past (table
2).  Marijuana was the most commonly used drug, with two-thirds
of probationers reporting use in the past.  Marijuana was also
the drug most commonly used by probationers in the month before
the offense (25%), as well as at the time of the offense itself
(10%).  

Cocaine-based drugs, including crack, and stimulants, such as
methamphetamine, were the next most commonly used drugs, with
roughly a third and a quarter of adults on probation,
respectively, reporting past use.  At the time of offense, 4% of
probationers said they had used cocaine-based drugs, while 2%
used stimulants.  For all other types of drugs, less than 20%
reported past use, and less than 1% reported use at the time of
offense.   

For all types of drugs, and for all time periods prior to the
offense, probationers reported lower levels of drug use than
local jail and State prison inmates.  For instance, 79% of State
prisoners and 82% of local jail inmates had used drugs in the
past, with roughly half of each group (50% and 55%) having used
drugs in the month before the offense. 

The greatest differences were seen in the use of cocaine-based
drugs.  While 1 in 10 probationers said they had used cocaine or
crack in the month prior to the offense, the same was true for 1
in 4 local jail and State prison inmates.  About 1 in 25
probationers said they were under the influence of cocaine or
crack at the time of offense, compared to 1 in 7 local jail and
State prison inmates.

---------------------------------------------------
Responses from a quarter of adults on probation indicated past
alcohol abuse or dependence
---------------------------------------------------

According to the CAGE diagnostic instrument (see box), 24% of
probationers reported experiences which are consistent with a
history of alcohol abuse or dependence (table 3).  The incidence
of alcohol abuse varied somewhat by offense type, with DWI (41%)
and other public-order (26%) offenders most likely to provide
three or more positive CAGE responses.  Assault (24%) and
burglary (22%) offenders also reported higher levels of alcohol
abuse.  Percentages were lower for offenses such as drug
trafficking (12%) and larceny/theft (15%).

Excluding public-order offenders, violent offenders (22%) were
the most likely to exhibit signs of alcohol abuse, followed by
property (18%) and drug (16%) offenders.  For all three offense
types, about half reported at least one positive CAGE response.

*Binge drinking is defined as having consumed as much as a fifth of liquor
in a single day, equivalent to 20 drinks, 3 bottles of wine, or as many as 
3 six-packs of beer.

The CAGE questionnaire is a diagnostic instrument for detecting a person's
history of alcohol abuse or dependence.  CAGE is an acronym for the four
questions used by the instrument -- attempts to (C)ut back on drinking,
(A)nnoyance at others' criticism of one's drinking, feelings of (G)uilt about
drinking, and needing a drink first thing in the morning as an (E)ye opener
to steady the nerves.  The CAGE instrument determines a person's likelihood of 
alcohol abuse by the number of positive responses to these four questions.

In a clinical test involving hospital admissions, three or more positive 
CAGE responses carried a .99 predictive value for alcohol abuse or dependence.

In addition, there is a strong relationship of positive CAGE responses 
to other self-reported indicators of prior alcohol abuse from the SAP survey
(table above).  While 12% of probationers with no positive CAGE responses
reported a past "binge drinking" episode, the same was true of 84% of those
with four CAGE responses.  In this report, only those probationers with three 
or more positive responses are categorized as alcohol abusive or dependent.

________________________________________________________________
Data on the predictive values of the CAGE instrument
are taken from the article "Screening for Alcohol Abuse Using
the CAGE Questionnaire" by B. Bush, et al., The American Journal
of Medicine, Vol. 82, February 1987, pp. 231-35
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------
Nearly two-thirds of probationers said they had driven while
under the influence of drugs or alcohol
---------------------------------------------------

Probationers reported high levels of dangerous and troubled
behavior associated with past drug and alcohol use.  Nearly
two-thirds (64%) of all probationers admitted to having driven
while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, including 57%
that had done so while drunk (table 4).  Half of all
probationers had also experienced drug- or alcohol-related
domestic disputes (51%) or had been arrested as a result of
using alcohol or drugs (50%).  In addition, a third had gotten
into physical fights related to drinking or drug use (35%), or
had engaged in "binge drinking," the equivalent of consuming a
fifth of liquor in a single day (35%). 

When looking at experiences associated with drug abuse, more
recent drug use was related to higher reported levels of such
behavior (table 5).  While 53% of probationers having any past
drug use said they had driven while under the influence of
drugs, the percentage rose to 74% among probationers using drugs
in the month prior to the offense.  For every listed behavior,
the percentages reported by probationers increased as the level
of prior drug use went from "ever in the past" to "in the month
before the offense."  Fewer than two-thirds of probationers with
any prior drug use reported any of these experiences, but over
85% of those using drugs in the month of the offense had engaged
in at least one of these troubled behaviors.   

---------------------------------------------------
Hispanic probationers reported the lowest levels of prior drug
use
---------------------------------------------------

There were few differences between men and women in the
percentages of reported drug use (table 6).  Nearly equal
percentages of men (70%) and women (68%) had used drugs in the
past as well as at the time of offense (14% and 12%,
respectively).  However, men reported consistently higher
percentages for measures of prior alcohol abuse.  Men were more
likely than women to report alcohol influence at the time of
offense (44% compared to 26%) and a prior binge drinking
experience (40% compared to 16%). 
  
Prior drug use patterns varied little across racial or ethnic
groups.  While Hispanics reported lower drug use on all
measures, non-Hispanic whites and blacks reported higher levels
of use.  Roughly 7 in 10 whites and blacks said they had used
drugs in the past, and 1 in 7 of both groups said they had used
drugs at the time of their offense.  On the three measures of
prior alcohol abuse, white adults on probation had higher
percentages than black and Hispanic adults.  Nearly half of
whites reported alcohol influence at the time of offense,
compared to a third of Hispanics and a quarter of blacks. 

---------------------------------------------------
Prior drug use dropped dramatically among probationers age 45 or
older
---------------------------------------------------

Adults on probation in the age categories under 45 (87% of all
probationers) reported similar levels of prior drug abuse, and
their incidence of drug use was consistently higher than that of
older probationers.  Over 70% of probationers under 45 reported
some prior drug use, compared to 37% of those 45 or older. 
Thirty-five percent of probationers under 45-but 9% of older
probationers-reported drug use in the month before their
offense.  

Measures of prior alcohol abuse displayed little variation
across age groups.  For example, between 30% and 38% of all age
groups reported a binge drinking experience.  About equal
percentages of probationers under 45 (24%) and older
probationers (27%) fit the CAGE profile of alcohol dependence or
reported alcohol influence at the time of offense (39% and 46%,
respectively).

---------------------------------------------------
Over 80% of probationers with a GED reported past drug use
---------------------------------------------------

Probationers with a GED (a General Equivalency Diploma, or the
equivalent to a high school degree) consistently reported the
highest levels of prior drug use when compared to those with
other educational attainments.  Over 80% of the probationers
with a GED said they had used drugs, and 58% reported regular
drug use in the past.  However, probationers with a GED reported
levels of prior alcohol abuse similar to those of other
probationers.

For other categories of educational background, reported drug
use varied between 26% and 34% for the month before the offense
and between 12% and 15% for the time of the offense. 
Probationers with an elementary education reported the lowest
levels of any past drug use (50%).  Across the educational
categories, from 35% to 44% of probationers committed their
offense under the influence of alcohol.

---------------------------------------------------
Two-thirds of probationers can be characterized as alcohol or
drug involved offenders 
---------------------------------------------------

About two-thirds of probationers reported at least one type of
involvement with alcohol or drug abuse in the time leading up to
their current offense.  The largest group of alcohol or
drug-involved probationers were those who were under the
influence at the time of their current offense (47%).  Also
included in this category were those probationers reporting drug
use in the month before the offense (32%), those fitting the
CAGE profile for alcohol dependence (24%), and those under a
probation sentence for DWI (21%) and drug (20%) offenses.

 CAGE responses             24
     
Alcohol or drug 
involved probationers       67.3%


Among the probationers interviewed, men (71%) were more likely
than women (54%) to report involvement in alcohol or drug abuse
before their current offense (table 7).  Among racial
groups, white non-Hispanics (71%) reported the highest incidence
of alcohol or drug involvement, followed by black non-Hispanics
(64%) and Hispanics (59%).  The reported levels of involvement
with alcohol or drug abuse varied little among age groups, with
probationers between ages 25 and 44 having slightly higher
levels than those in other age groups.

---------------------------------------------------
While on probation, half of probationers tested--but less than 
a fifth treated--for drug use  
---------------------------------------------------

Nearly half of all probationers (49%) reported having been
tested for drug use while on their current probation sentence
(table 8).  The percentage of probationers tested for illegal
drugs consistently rose among those with more severe drug use
histories.  Two-thirds of probationers using drugs in the month
of the offense had been tested for drug use.  Three-quarters of
those who committed their offense to obtain drug money had been
tested.  

Seventeen percent of all probationers reported participation in
a drug treatment program during their probation sentence.  The
percentage rose as the severity of prior drug use increased.  Of
those with any past drug use, 25% had received treatment, and
the percentage grew to 42% of those using drugs in the month
before the offense.  A majority of those using drugs at the time
of offense reported participation in drug treatment during their
current sentence. 

However, a substantial percentage of probationers with severe
drug use histories had not been tested or received treatment. 
About half of probationers who committed their offense to obtain
money for drugs had received drug treatment while on probation. 
Two-fifths of intravenous drug users had not received any drug
treatment during their probation sentence.  In every group of
probationers with prior drug use, between 26% and 45% did not
report being tested for drug use.

Comparing first-year probationers with those who had already
served a year or more of their sentence suggests that the amount
of time on probation affects the chances of having been tested
for drugs.  Among first-year probationers, 41% had been tested
for drugs during their probation sentence, compared to 56% of
those who had served at least a year on probation.  For all
levels of prior drug use, the percentage of probationers tested
for drugs was higher for those having spent a year or more on
probation.  For example, 45% of first-year probationers with
past drug use had been tested for drugs, compared to 63% of
those having served a year or more.

The amount of time served on probation had a smaller impact on
the reported levels of drug treatment.  While 16% of first-year
probationers had been treated for drug abuse during their
sentence, 19% of those probationers with at least a year served
had been treated.  For most levels of prior drug use, first-year
probationers were only slightly less likely to have received
drug treatment while on probation.  Of those using drugs at the
time of offense, 51% of first-year probationers had been
treated, compared 
to 53% of those with a year or more served.  

---------------------------------------------------
Types of drug treatment varied little among probationers with
differing severity of past drug use
---------------------------------------------------

Over a fifth of all probationers had received drug treatment at
some time in the past, with the percentage rising to a third of
those with prior drug use and half of those using drugs in the
month of the offense (table 9).  An estimated 17% of
probationers had received drug treatment while on their current
sentence; 15% had received prior treatment; and 4% had received
treatment while in prison or jail.  About half of those who
received drug treatment during their current sentence reported
that they were enrolled in a treatment program at the time of
the survey (8%).

Although some probationers had received drug treatment more than
once, they may not have been in the same kind of treatment
program each time.  Probationers had participated in several
different types of drug treatment programs, with outpatient care
(17%) and self-help groups (14%) being the most common (table
10).  Nearly equal percentages of probationers had received
counseling (8%), crisis or emergency care (8%), and inpatient
care (8%) at some time in the past.

The percentage of probationers reporting participation in each
type of program rose with the severity of prior drug use, but
outpatient care and self-help groups remained the most common
types of treatment.  Among those reporting drug use in the month
prior to the offense, 41% had received outpatient care, and 34%
had been in self-help groups.  Nearly equal percentages of these
probationers had received inpatient care (21%), crisis or
emergency care (19%), and counseling (19%).  

The percentage of probationers receiving drug treatment during
their current probation sentence rose with higher levels of
prior drug use (table 11).  While 25% of those probationers with
any prior drug use had received drug treatment during their
current probation sentence, this figure rose to 42% for those
using drugs in the month before the offense.  Among all
probationers, outpatient care (12%) and self-help groups (11%)
were the most common types of treatment received during
probation, with fewer probationers receiving counseling (6%),
inpatient care (4%), or crisis/ emergency care (4%).  Among
probationers who used drugs in the month of the offense,
outpatient care (30%) and self-help groups (28%) remained the
most popular types of programs.

Of the individual drug treatment programs, the most common among
all probationers were Narcotics/Cocaine Anonymous groups (11%),
drug rehabilitation (8%), and outpatient clinics (6%).  The
types of treatment programs did not differ according to the
level of the probationers' past drug use.  For probationers
using drugs in the month of the offense, the most common
programs were still Narcotics/Cocaine Anonymous (27%), drug
rehabilitation (20%), and outpatient clinics (17%).  Regardless
of prior drug use, the least common drug treatment programs were
employee assistance and methadone maintenance programs, Adult
Children of Alcoholics groups, emergency rooms, and crisis
centers.

---------------------------------------------------
A third of all probationers received alcohol treatment during
probation
---------------------------------------------------

While 22% of all probationers had received any type of drug
treatment in the past, almost twice as many probationers (41%)
reported having ever received treatment for alcohol abuse (table
12).  Past treatment was reported by nearly two-thirds of those
probationers who had engaged in alcohol-related fights and by
over three-quarters of those fitting the CAGE profile of alcohol
abuse. 

Compared to probationers with past drug use, a larger share of
probationers with a history of alcohol abuse had received
treatment.  For example, less than half (46%) of those
probationers who had used drugs regularly had ever received drug
treatment.  Among probationers reporting past incidents 
of "binge drinking," 63% had received treatment for alcohol
abuse in the past.  Among probationers under the influence of
alcohol at the time of their offense, even higher percentages of
past treatment were reported (73%). 

As was the case with probationers' participation in drug
treatment programs, self-help groups (32%) and outpatient care
(26%) were the most common types of past alcohol treatment. 
Equal percentages of probationers had received counseling (12%)
and crisis/emergency care (12%) in the past, while inpatient
care (8%) was the least common type of treatment.  

While the incidence of alcohol treatment rose with more severe
levels of alcohol abuse, the most common types of treatment
programs remained the same.  Among those probationers fitting
the CAGE profile of alcohol abuse, the percentage reporting any
type of past alcohol treatment rose sharply to 78%, but
self-help groups (68%) and outpatient care (56%) were still the
most common types of treatment.  Likewise, similar percentages
of probationers reported past emergency care (37%) and
counseling (34%), while inpatient care (25%) remained the type
of treatment least often received.

During their current sentence to probation, a third of all
probationers had received some type of alcohol treatment (table
13).  Twenty-four percent of probationers had participated in a
self-help group on their current probation sentence, while 18%
received outpatient care.  

Treatment was most often reported by those with more severe
histories of abuse.  The incidence of treatment during the
current sentence rose to nearly two-thirds for those
probationers fitting the CAGE profile for alcohol abuse (65%)
and those using alcohol at the time of offense (62%).  For all
levels of prior alcohol abuse, self-help groups and outpatient
care were the most common types of alcohol treatment, followed
by counseling and nearly equal percentages of emergency and
inpatient care.  

Of the individual treatment programs, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)
was the most commonly used.  A quarter of all probationers (24%)
had enrolled in AA during their current sentence to probation,
followed by alcohol rehabilitation (11%) and outpatient clinics
(8%).  Across all levels of prior alcohol abuse, participation
in AA was nearly twice as high as any other alcohol treatment
program.  Among those probationers fitting the CAGE profile for
alcohol abuse, a majority (54%) had enrolled in AA on their
current probation sentence. 

---------------------------------------------------
Over 80% of current drug users had personal contact with their 
probation officer in the past 30 days
---------------------------------------------------

Nearly 100% of all current drug users -defined as those who
reported drug use in the month before the offense reported
having some kind of special condition included in their sentence
to probation (table 14).  Monetary conditions such as fees,
fines, and court costs were the most common condition (82%), and
27% reported an obligation to pay restitution to the victim of
their offense.  A majority of current drug users also reported
restrictions against the use of alcohol and drugs (56%).  Half
of current drug users had sentences requiring some kind of
substance abuse treatment, and 42% reported receiving drug
treatment on their current sentence.

Almost all current drug users (91%) had been contacted by their
probation officer in the past 30 days.  Personal contacts made
in the probation office were the most common form of reported
contact (84%), followed by telephone contacts (24%) and personal
contacts made in the field (21%).  Contacts made through the
mail, reported by 7% of current drug users, were the least
common type of reported contact.  Overall, personal contacts
with the probation officer (85%) were much more common than
those made through the mail or by telephone (31%).

---------------------------------------------------
Fewer than 1 in 7 current drug users on probation reported a 
prior drug offense sentence
---------------------------------------------------

Among those probationers reporting drug use in the month before
their offense, violent offenders (15%) made up the smallest
current offense category.  Current drug users were most likely
to be under sentence for drug offenses (42%), followed by
property (23%) and public-order (19%) offenses.  Less than a
fifth of current drug users reported committing their current
offense to obtain money for drugs.  Thirteen percent of current
drug users reported prior sentences for a drug offense; 8% had a
single past drug offense sentence, and 5% reported multiple
prior drug sentences.

---------------------------------------------------
Half of alcohol or drug-involved probationers received treatment 
on their current probation sentence 
---------------------------------------------------

Nearly a third of alcohol or drug-involved probationers were
currently enrolled in an alcohol or drug treatment program when
interviewed (table 15).  Half of alcohol or drug-involved
probationers said they were treated on their current sentence to
probation, and about two-thirds had been treated at some time in
their lives.  

---------------------------------------------------
Methodology
---------------------------------------------------

The 1995 Survey of Adults on Probation (SAP) was conducted for
the Bureau of Justice Statistics by the U.S. Bureau of the
Census.  It was the first nationally representative survey to
collect information on the individual characteristics of adult
probationers.

The SAP was comprised of two components:  (a) a review of
probationers' administrative records and (b) personal interviews
with probationers.  The information in this report was
obtained from personal interviews conducted by Census Bureau
representatives in probation offices between February 1995 and
September 1995.

Sample design
---------------------------------------------------

The sample for the survey was drawn from all 2,627 State,
county, and municipal probation agencies with a total of
2,618,132 formally sentenced probationers (appendix table 1). 
The universe came from the 1991 Census of Probation and Parole
Agencies.

The sample design was a stratified two-stage selection in which
probation agencies were sampled in the first stage and
individual probationers were sampled in the second stage.

In the first stage, probation agencies were stratified into 16
strata defined by government branch (executive or judicial),
level of government (State or local), and census region
(Northeast, Midwest, South, or West).  A total of 206 agencies
were selected.  Excluding 19 agencies subsequently determined to
be out of scope and 20 which refused to participate resulted in
a final total of 167 agencies selected for the administrative
records-check component.  (See Characteristics of Adults on
Probation, 1995.)

For the personal interview sample, 122 of the originally
selected agencies were chosen.  The largest 43 self-representing
agencies were selected with certainty.  Of the 122 clusters of
agencies that were not self-representing, 79 were selected using
a systematic sample.  Excluding agencies in the sample that
would only participate in the records checks resulted in a total
of 101 probation offices in which interviews were conducted.

Bureau of the Census field representatives visited each agency
selected for the records check and systematically selected a
sample of probationers using predetermined procedures.  Only
persons age 18 and older who were formally sentenced to
probation and who were not absconders were included.  Excluded
were persons supervised by a Federal probation agency, those
only on parole, persons on presentence or pretrial diversion,
and juveniles.

At agencies that had also been selected for inclusion in the
personal interview component, field representatives developed a
list of persons eligible for a personal interview by further
excluding those probationers not on active probation (defined as
being required to make office visits at any interval), those
incarcerated, and those in residential treatment.  Using
predetermined procedures, a systematic sample of probationers
was selected for personal interviews.

Approximately 1 of every 442 probationers were selected for a
records check, and a total of 5,867 records checks were
completed by a probation officer or other probation agency
representative.  The overall response rate of 87% for the
records-check component represents the combination of an agency
response rate of 88% and a records-check completion rate of 99%.

A total of 4,703 probationers were selected for a personal
interview.  To maximize response rates, probation office
personnel were asked to make initial contact with probationers
regarding the SAP, to schedule personal interviews to coincide
with regular office visits whenever possible, and to follow up
to encourage participation.  All interviews for the SAP were
conducted in the probation office.

Of the 4,703 probationers selected, 641 were in agencies that
refused to allow personal interviews.  A total of 2,030
interviews were completed, representing a 50% response rate in
participating agencies.  When combined with an agency
participation rate of 86% in the personal interviews and an
agency response rate of 88% for records checks, the overall
personal interview response rate totaled 38%.

Nonresponse adjustment
---------------------------------------------------

Estimates for the probation population were initially generated
for the records check component, based on the completed records
checks and on weighting factors derived from the original
probability of selection in the sample.  These factors were
adjusted for variable rates of nonresponse across strata.  A
further adjustment was made to the 1994 year-end counts of the
number of adults formally sentenced to probation-a total of
2,620,560 probationers.

Probation population estimates for the personal interview
component were developed next, starting with a site base weight
derived from the records check sample weights and the original
probability of a site being selected for the personal interview
sample.  Additional adjustments were made for agencies that only
participated in the records check and for persons who were
sampled but not interviewed.  The estimated total personal
interview population of 2,065,896 is smaller than the estimate
for the records-check component because of the exclusion of
probationers who were inactive, incarcerated, or in residential
treatment.   

Characteristics of nonresponse
---------------------------------------------------

Within the personal interview sample, probationers who kept in
closer contact with their probation officer were more likely to
complete an interview (appendix table 2).  Nearly 80% of
probationers interviewed had had face-to-face contact with their
probation officer in the past 30 days, compared to half of those
in the sample who did not complete an interview.  Because all
interviews were conducted in the probation offices, those
probationers required to make frequent visits to the office were
easier to schedule and were given more opportunities to complete
an interview.  

Felony probationers were also more likely to complete a personal
interview than other sampled probationers.  Felons made up
two-thirds of interviewed probationers, compared to half of
those not interviewed.  This difference is not surprising, given
that felons are more likely to be placed under close supervision
by their probation office.  Because most public-order offenders
were misdemeanants, they were less likely to be under close
supervision or interviewed.  (See Characteristics of Adults on
Probation, 1995.)  

Probationers who completed an interview were also less likely
than other sampled probationers to have had a prior sentence to
probation or incarceration.  This is likely the result of the
personal interview population's higher percentage of felons and
lower percentage of public-order offenders.  Because felons with
prior criminal sentences are more likely to receive a sentence
to incarceration than felons without prior sentences, many felons
on probation are likely to be first-time offenders.  Likewise,
probationers convicted of misdemeanor public-order offenses will
probably receive a probation sentence, regardless of prior
sentences.  

Comparing administrative records and personal interviews
---------------------------------------------------

After adjustment for the personal interview nonresponse
discussed above, the composition of the personal interview
sample closely resembled that of the records check (appendix
table 3).  One exception was the level of contact probationers
had with their probation officer, because of the exclusion of
inactive probationers from the personal interview sample.  As a
result, about 80% of the probationers in the personal interview
sample had had face-to-face contact with their probation officer
in the last 30 days, compared to 61% of those in the
records-check sample. (See Characteristics of Adults on
Probation, 1995, table 9.)  

While the composition of the personal interview sample was
influenced by the probationers' level of supervision, there was
no similar relationship to the amount of time served on
probation.  The personal interview sample included a slightly
higher percentage of first-year probationers (49%) than the
records-check sample (45%), but the overall distributions of
time served on probation displayed little variation.

In terms of demographic and offense characteristics, there was
also very little variation between the records check and
personal interview samples.  The personal interview and records
check samples included nearly identical percentages of men and
Hispanics.  Overall, the sex, race/Hispanic origin, and age
distributions of the probationers in the two samples displayed
no significant differences. 

After adjustment for nonresponse, the personal interview and
records-check samples had similar offense distributions and
about equal percentages of felons.  However, the personal
interview sample did include fewer probationers with a prior
sentence to probation or incarceration.

Accuracy of the estimates
---------------------------------------------------

The accuracy of the estimates presented in this report depends
on two types of error:  sampling and nonsampling.  Sampling
error is the variation that may occur by chance because a sample
rather than a complete enumeration of the population was
conducted.  Nonsampling error can be attributed to many sources,
such as the inability to obtain information about all cases in
the sample, the inability to obtain correct information from the
probationers, and processing errors.  In any survey the full
extent of the nonsampling error is never known.

The sampling error, as measured by an estimated standard error,
varies by the size of the estimate and the size of the base
population.  Estimates of the standard errors have been
calculated for the 1995 survey (appendix table 4).  These
estimates may be used to construct confidence intervals around
percentages in this report.  For example, the 95-percent
confidence interval around the percentage of adults who said
they committed the offense for which they were on probation
while under the influence of alcohol or drugs is approximately
46.8% plus or minus 1.96 times 1.2% (or 44.4% to 49.2%).

These standard errors may also be used to test the significance
of the difference between two sample statistics by pooling the
standard errors of the two sample estimates.  For example, the
standard error of the difference between white and black adults
on probation who reported having been under the influence of
alcohol at the time of their offense would be 2.6% (or the
square root of the sum of the squared standard errors for each
group).  The 95-percent confidence interval around the
difference would be 1.96 times 2.6% (or 5.2%).  Since the
difference of 20.4% (46.6% minus 26.2%) is greater than 5.2%,
the difference would be considered statistically significant.

The standard errors reported should be used only for tests on
all probationers.  Comparisons of male and female probationers
require different standard errors.

Note:  The universe file for the 1995 Survey of Adults on Probation was 
based on the 1991 Census of Probation and Parole Agencies.  In this census, 
agencies reported the address of their field offices and the number of adults 
under supervision in each office.  Field offices were categorized based on the 
characteristics of their agencies by government branch (executive or judicial) and 
level of government (State or local). 
a\Of 206 offices selected for records checks, 19 were out of scope,
not currently supervising adult probationers, and 20 would not participate. 
b\Of 5,922 eligible probationers selected within 167 offices/sites, completed 
records-check forms were received for 5,867 (or 99%).
c\Excluding agencies which refused to participate in personal interviews from the 122 
agencies originally sampled resulted in a total of 101 offices where interviews were conducted.
d\Of 4,062 persons selected for a personal interview in participating agencies, 
2,030 interviews were completed (or 50%).
