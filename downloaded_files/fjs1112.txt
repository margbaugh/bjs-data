Federal Justice Statistics, 2011-2012

Mark Motivans, Ph.D., BJS Statistician

During fiscal year 2012, the number of suspects arrested for a federal 
offense declined to 172,248 after reaching a record 181,726 suspects in 2009. 
From 1994 to 2012, the number of suspects arrested by federal law enforcement 
more than doubled, from 80,450 in 1994 to 172,248 in 2012 (figure 1). In 
recent years, federal law enforcement activity has slowed along with the 
later stages of cases processing in U.S. district court (persons charged, 
convicted, and sentenced to prison). From 2010 to 2012, arrests decreased at 
an annual average rate of 1.9%.*** Footnote 11The reporting period used 
throughout this report is the fiscal year, which is from October 1 to 
September 30. All percent changes referenced in this report are calculated 
using the average of the annual change between years.***

At yearend 2012, about 414,000 offenders were under some form of federal 
correctional control: 47% were confined by the Federal Bureau of Prisons 
(BOP), 15% were confined in pretrial detention, 32% were on post-conviction 
supervision in the community, and 6% were under pretrial supervision in the 
community (table 1).

Summary
**********

The number of federal arrests declined from 179,034 in 2010 to 172,248 in 
2012. The decline in arrests was due to decreases across several offense 
types, including property (down 3,381), drug (down 2,786), and supervision 
violations (down 2,607). During this period, arrests for immigration offenses 
increased by 3,203. Illegal immigration (50%) was the most common arrest 
offense in 2012, followed by drug (15%) and supervision (13%) violations. 
From 2010 to 2012, arrests for regulatory offenses increased from 266 to 300 
(average annual increase of 6%). Sex offense arrests increased at the next 
fastest rate (up 3% per year), followed by immigration offenses (up 2%). 
During this period, fraud offenses (down 10% per year) declined the most, 
followed by other property (down 6%) and supervision (down 5%) offenses.

The five federal judicial districts along the U.S.-Mexico border (California 
Southern, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas Western, and Texas Southern) accounted 
for 60% of all federal arrests in 2012, up from 45% of all arrests in 2006 
(map 1) (see Federal Justice Statistics, 2010, NCJ 239913, BJS web, December 
2013). In 2012, these five districts also accounted for 53% of suspects 
investigated by U.S. attorneys, 54% of suspects detained prior to trial, 39% 
of defendants convicted, and 41% of offenders sentenced to federal prison.

In 2012, about 9 in 10 defendants in cases adjudicated in U.S. district court 
were convicted. Ninety-one percent of felonies charged in U.S. district court 
were disposed by a guilty plea. Of defendants convicted, about 8 in 10 
received a prison sentence. The median federal prison sentence imposed was 33 
months.  

Between fiscal yearend 2011 and 2012, the number of persons under federal 
correctional control increased by 2,764 (up 0.7%). During this period, the 
number of federally sentenced persons in BOP confinement increased by 1,217 
offenders and the number of persons under community supervision increased by 
1,993. The number of persons on probation decreased from 22,866 in 2011 to 
22,307 in 2012.

This report describes defendants processed at each stage of the federal 
justice system—arrest and booking, investigation and prosecution, pretrial 
detention, adjudication and sentencing, corrections, and supervision in the 
community. Data are from the Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP). The 
FJSP collects, standardizes, and reports on administrative data received from 
six federal justice agencies: the U.S. Marshals Service, Drug Enforcement 
Administration, Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, Executive Office 
for U.S. Attorneys, the BOP, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission. 

********************
Arrest and booking
********************

The U.S. Marshal is the primary law enforcement officer for the U.S. Marshals 
Service, and each of the 94 federal judicial districts has one. Deputy U.S. 
Marshals oversee tasks involved in taking federal suspects charged with a 
crime into custody, including booking, processing and detention, court 
security, and prisoner transportation.***Footnote 2The unit of count for 
federal arrest data reported in this section is a suspect arrested and booked 
by the U.S. Marshals Service. The phrase “suspects arrested and booked by the 
U.S. Marshals Service” is used to describe arrests and bookings where each 
arrest and booking for an individual suspect occurring in the same year is 
counted separately.*** 

In 2012, the U.S. Marshals Service arrested and 
booked 172,248 suspects for a federal offense
**************************************************

The number of suspects arrested and booked for violations of federal law 
decreased from 179,034 in 2010 to 172,248 in 2012—a decrease of 6,786 
suspects (table 2). The number of suspects arrested and booked increased each 
year from 1994 to 2009, and declined each year from 2009 to 2012.

Immigration offenses comprised half of federal 
suspects arrested and booked in 2012
**************************************************

In 2012, the U.S. Marshals Service arrested and booked 85,458 immigration 
suspects, up 3,203 from 2010 and up 2,252 from 2011. Immigration offenses 
made up 46% of suspects arrested and booked by the U.S. Marshals Service in 
2010 and 50% in 2012. Drug offenses (15% or 25,929 suspects) were the second 
most common offense among suspects arrested and booked in 2012 as 25,929 drug 
suspects were arrested and booked. This was down from 29,954 drug suspects 
arrested and booked in 2011.

Nearly 60% of federal suspects arrested and booked 
by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2012 were in five 
judicial districts along the U.S.-Mexico border 
**************************************************

In 2012, 102,557 suspects were arrested and booked by the U.S. Marshals in 
five U.S.-Mexico border districts (California Southern, Arizona, New Mexico, 
Texas Western, and Texas Southern), compared to 69,691 in the remaining 89 
districts. The Southern District of Texas in 2012, and the district of 
Arizona both had 18%. From 2010 to 2012, the rate of suspects arrested and 
booked in U.S.-Mexico border districts increased by less than 1% annually. In 
comparison, the number of suspects arrested and booked in other border 
districts declined by 5% annually (from 77,816 in 2010 to 69,691 in 2012). 
Suspects arrested in the Western District of Texas increased at the fastest 
rate from 2010 to 2012

Suspects arrested and booked by the U.S. Marshals 
Service in the Western 
**************************************************

Suspects arrested and booked by the U.S. Marshals Service in the Western 
District of Texas increased by an annual average of 10.8% from 2010 to 2012 
and had the third most federal arrests in the United States (after the 
Southern District of Texas and the District of Arizona). The number of 
suspects arrested in the Western District of Texas increased from 21,793 
suspects in 2010 to 21,930 suspects in 2011, and then increased to 26,518 in 
2012. The number of suspects arrested in Texas Southern increased by 1,500 
during this period. On average, from 2010 to 2012, federal arrests decreased 
in the districts of New Mexico (down 9.6% annually), Arizona (down 5.3%), and 
California Southern (down 3.6%).

From 2010 to 2012, regulatory offenses increased 
at the fastest rate
**************************************************

Regulatory arrests increased by an average of 6.3% per year from 2010 (266 
arrests) to 2012 (300), making it the fastest growing offense among suspects 
arrested and booked by the U.S. Marshals Service. Immigration arrests doubled 
from 1994 to 1998, doubled from 1998 to 2004, and doubled again from 2004 to 
2008 (figure 2). 

From 2008 to 2012, the U.S. Marshals Service arrested and booked 413,700 
immigration suspects. Ninety-one percent of immigration suspects over this 
period were arrested in five judicial districts along the U.S.-Mexico border 
(map 2).

Sex offenses were the second fastest growing 
federal arrest offense from 2010 to 2012
**************************************************

The number of suspects arrested and booked for a sex offense (e.g., child 
pornography, sex abuse, and illegal sex transportation) doubled from 1994 to 
1998. Suspects arrested for sex offenses doubled again from 1998 to 2004 
(figure 3). Sex offenses increased by an annual average of 3%, from 3,034 
arrests in 2010 to 3,171 arrests in 2012. 

Suspects arrested and booked for a sex offense were relatively dispersed by 
federal district of arrest. From 2008 to 2012, the U.S. Marshals Service 
arrested and booked 15,779 sex offense suspects. Twelve federal districts had 
more than 300 sex offense arrests from 2008 to 2012 (map 3). During this 
period, the Western District of Texas (484), Florida Middle (464), and 
California Central (425) had the most sex offense arrests, followed by the 
district of Arizona (392) and Missouri Eastern and Michigan Eastern (380 
each).

Drug offenses were the second most common offense 
among suspects arrested and booked by the 
U.S. Marshals Service in 2012 
**************************************************

The U.S. Marshals Service arrested and booked 25,929 suspects for drug 
offenses in 2012. This represented a 4.5% average annual decrease from 2010. 
From 1994 to 2012, the number of drug arrests was highest in 2002 (33,056) 
then declined each year from 2002 to 2008 and increased in 2009. From 2010 to 
2012, drug arrests declined to the lowest level since 1997 (figure 4). 
From 2008 to 2012, drug offenses (143,777) accounted for 16% of the total 
number (884,018) of arrests (not shown). In 10 districts, the percentage of 
drug arrests as a share of total arrests from 2008 to 2012 exceeded 35%. In 
two districts, Connecticut (44%) and Texas Eastern (43%), drug arrests made 
up more than 40% of total arrests during the same period. In 8 districts, 
drug arrests made up less than 15% of total arrests made during this period 
(map 4).

DHS law enforcement agencies made more than 
half of federal arrests in 2012
**************************************************

Agencies of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accounted for 58% of 
suspects arrested in 2012 (table 3). DHS agencies include Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Secret 
Service, and others. Department of Justice (DOJ) agencies made 37% of 
suspects arrested and booked by the U.S. Marshals Service in 2012. DOJ 
agencies include the FBI; Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA); Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF); the U.S. Marshals Service; 
and others.

Arrests made by DHS law enforcement agencies 
increased at the fastest rate from 2008 to 2012
**************************************************

Arrests by DHS agencies increased at an average annual rate of 2.0% from 2008 
to 2012. Arrests made by ICE increased by an annual average of 22.1%, and 
those made by CBP declined by an annual average of 5.8%. Arrests by DOJ 
agencies decreased annually by about 0.8% from 2008 to 2012, with FBI arrests 
increasing by 3.3% and U.S. Marshals Service arrests decreasing by an average 
of 2.3%. The annual number of arrests made by ATF changed little between 2008 
and 2012

**************************************************************
******************************
Patterns in DEA drug arrests
******************************

In 2012, the DEA made 31,628 state 
and federal arrests
**************************************************

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) reported 31,628 drug arrests in 
2012, down from 32,379 in 2011.***Footnote 3 The unit of count for the 
federal drug arrest data received from the DEA reported in this section is a 
suspect arrested by the DEA. The phrase “suspects arrested by the DEA” is 
used to describe arrests where each arrest for an individual suspect is 
counted separately. Individual suspects can be arrested and booked by the DEA 
more than once in a year. The DEA data do not distinguish between arrests 
that are referred for state versus federal prosecution.***  The number of 
drug arrests by the DEA increased over the 1990s to a peak of 46,435 arrests 
in 2000, followed by a decline to 29,238 in 2003. From 2003 to 2012, the 
number of DEA arrests increased annually by an average of 1% (figure 5).

Marijuana arrests by the DEA increased at the fastest annual average rate 
from 2002 to 2012 (2.0%), followed by opiates (2.1%). The number of DEA 
arrests for marijuana coincided with the number of arrests for 
methamphetamine from 1998 until 2006. However, since 2006, the annual number 
of marijuana arrests has been greater. Arrests for crack cocaine (annual 
average decrease of 4.6%), powder cocaine (down 2.4%), and methamphetamine 
(down 0.9%) each declined from 2002 to 2012.

Cocaine was the most common drug type involved 
in arrests by the DEA in 2012
**************************************************

Suspects arrested for offenses involving cocaine powder (7,485) and crack 
cocaine (2,575) accounted for 32% of all suspects arrested by the DEA in 2012 
(table 4). Twenty-four percent of suspects were arrested for offenses 
involving cocaine powder and 8% were arrested for crack cocaine. The 
remaining suspects arrested by the DEA in 2012 were for marijuana (6,963), 
methamphetamine (6,087), opiates (3,664), and other or nondrug offenses 
(4,854). Marijuana was the second most common drug at arrest by the DEA from 
2006 to 2012. In 2012, more than half (53%) of arrests made by the DEA 
involved marijuana that had been cultivated domestically compared to 
internationally (47%) (not shown).

Hispanic suspects made up nearly half (45%) 
of suspects arrested by the DEA in 2012
**************************************************

In 2012, about half (45%) of suspects arrested by the DEA were of Hispanic or 
Latino origin, followed by white (28%) and black (24%) suspects. Hispanic 
suspects were involved in 3 in 5 (61%) arrests for cocaine powder, more than 
half (53%) of arrests for methamphetamine, and less than half (44%) of 
arrests for marijuana offenses. Seventy-seven percent of crack cocaine 
suspects were black, and 41% of methamphetamine suspects were white. White 
suspects composed the largest share (51%) of suspects arrested by the DEA for 
other or nondrug offenses.

Most suspects arrested by the DEA in 2012 were 
male (83%) and age 34 or younger (56%)
**************************************************

About a quarter of male suspects were arrested for cocaine powder (25%) or 
marijuana (23%), followed by methamphetamine (18%). Females accounted for 17% 
of all DEA drug arrests and 22% of all methamphetamine arrests. About a 
quarter (25%) of females arrested by the DEA for drug violations were 
arrested for methamphetamine, followed by other drug offenses (24%) and 
cocaine powder and marijuana offenses (each 17%). More than half of all 
suspects arrested by the DEA were age 34 or younger, and the median age was 
similar across all drug types. Five percent of arrests by the DEA were of 
suspects age 55 or older.

In 2012, most females arrested by the DEA were 
white, while most males were Hispanic
**************************************************

For both males and females, the proportion of Hispanic suspects arrested by 
the DEA dropped in the early 1990s and has increased since then. Among 
females arrested by the DEA in 2012, 44% were white, 35% were Hispanic, and 
18% were black. Between 1994 and 2012, white females almost always had the 
greatest share of female DEA arrests. The percentage of black female arrests 
by the DEA increased from 24% in 1994 to 29% in 1995, and declined to 18% in 
2012 (figure 6). 

In 2012, Hispanics accounted for 47% of male arrests made by the DEA. This 
represented a relatively consistent level in the Hispanic share of male 
arrests since 1994. Blacks made up 25% of arrests of males by the DEA in 
2012, and whites composed 25% of male arrests (figure 7).

**************************************************************
***************
Prosecution
**************

The 93 U.S. attorneys serve as the chief federal law enforcement officers 
within their respective districts.*** Footnote 4 One U.S. attorney serves two 
districts (Guam and Northern Mariana Islands). This section of the report 
combines Northern Mariana Islands with Guam for statistical reporting.*** 
Investigations are most commonly referred to a U.S. attorney by a federal law 
enforcement agency. State and local law enforcement agencies are also sources 
of criminal referrals to U.S. attorney’s offices in their district. U.S. 
attorneys determine which cases they will prosecute and establish policies 
and priorities within their federal judicial districts. U.S. attorneys take 
into account a variety of factors, such as DOJ priorities, available 
resources, state and local priorities, and law enforcement priorities. 

Federal legislation influences the work of federal prosecutors, especially 
the types of offenses that are referred for prosecution. The Homeland 
Security Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-296) reorganized key federal law enforcement 
agencies and coincided with increased enforcement of immigration laws, 
especially in federal districts along the U.S.-Mexico border. The act 
transferred responsibility for the U.S. Customs Service and the Secret 
Service from the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) to DHS. 
Responsibility for the Immigration and Naturalization Service transferred 
from DOJ to DHS, and ATF transferred from the Treasury to DOJ.

In 2012, five federal judicial districts referred 
more than half (53%) of suspects to U.S. attorneys 
**************************************************

In 2012, 190,596 matters were referred to U.S. attorneys. Five federal 
districts along the U.S.-Mexico border referred 101,265 (53%) of these 
matters (map 5). After the border districts, the districts with the most 
referrals included California Central (3,532), Florida Southern (3,463), and 
Virginia Eastern (3,436).

In 2012, 57% of suspects in matters concluded by 
U.S. attorneys had been referred by the Department 
of Homeland Security
**************************************************

Ten years after the reorganization of federal law enforcement agencies under 
the Homeland Security Act of 2002, DHS agencies referred 57% of all matters 
concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2012, down from 60% of matters concluded by 
U.S. attorneys in 2008 (table 5). Law enforcement agencies within the DOJ 
referred 28% of suspects in matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2012, 
compared to 23% of referrals in 2008 and 57% of referrals in 2001. Suspects 
in matters concluded by U.S. attorneys referred by the Department of Treasury 
made up 2% of all matters concluded in 2012, down from 20% in 2001.

Immigration and drug charges made up two-thirds 
of all matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2012
**************************************************

U.S. attorneys concluded 196,109 matters in 2012 (table 6). Forty-eight 
percent of matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2012 involved an 
immigration offense, and 20% involved a drug charge. Overall, the number of 
matters concluded increased by an annual average of 2% from 2008 to 2012. 
Among matters concluded by U.S. attorneys during this period, immigration 
(4%), sex offenses (1%), and regulatory offenses (1%) increased at the 
fastest annual rate. The number of weapon offenses decreased by an annual 
average of 1%, from 11,744 matters concluded in 2008 to 11,162 in 2012.

Matters concluded in five federal judicial 
districts along the U.S.-Mexico border increased 
by 5% from 2008 to 2012
**************************************************

More than half (53%) of matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2012 occurred 
in the five federal judicial districts of California Southern, Arizona, New 
Mexico, Texas Western, and Texas Southern. In comparison, these districts 
handled less than half (48%) of matters concluded in 2008. The number of 
matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in all other districts decreased, from 
95,939 matters concluded in 2008 to 92,185 matters in 2012.

Almost half of suspects in matters concluded 
in 2012 were prosecuted by U.S. attorneys
**************************************************
 
Matters involving drug and weapons offenses were the most likely to be 
prosecuted in 2012. Suspects charged with drug (75%) and weapons (71%) 
offenses had the highest prosecution rates in 2012, followed by sex (61%), 
violent (57%), property (50%), and public order (40%) offenses (table 7).
 
U.S. attorneys may file charges and prosecute defendants in U.S. district 
court, or they may file charges and prosecute matters before U.S. 
magistrates, who have the authority to adjudicate misdemeanor offenses (18 
U.S.C. § 3401). U.S. attorneys may also decline to file charges for reasons 
such as weak or insufficient evidence, minimal federal interest, lack of 
resources, or lack of criminal intent. Matters that are declined may also be 
referred to other authorities for prosecution or be settled through 
alternative resolution procedures.

Nearly 4 in 10 matters concluded in 2012 were 
disposed by U.S. magistrates
**************************************************

Thirty-nine percent of matters concluded by U.S. attorneys in 2012 were 
disposed by U.S. magistrates, while 15% were declined for further 
prosecution. Offenses that were most likely to be disposed by U.S. 
magistrates included immigration (71%), other public order (23%), and other 
property (15%) offenses. In the five U.S.-Mexico border districts, two-thirds 
(66%) of matters concluded by U.S. attorneys were disposed by U.S. 
magistrates, compared to 9% of matters in other districts. Suspects involved 
in regulatory offenses were most likely to be declined for prosecution (52%), 
followed by fraud (37%) and other property (35%) offenses.
 
Case processing time to conclude a matter decreased 
from over 3 months in 1994 to about 2 weeks in 2012
**************************************************

The median time from receipt of a matter by U.S. attorneys to prosecute, 
decline, or dispose by U.S. magistrate was 15 days in 2012. This was a 
decrease from 99 days in 1994. In 2012, the median processing time took far 
longer for matters that were declined (438 days) than for matters prosecuted 
(25 days) or disposed by a U.S. magistrate (half were disposed on the same 
day). The median case processing time for matters prosecuted remained 
relatively stable, declining slightly from 26 days in 1994 to 25 days in 2012 
(figure 8). The median case processing time for a matter disposed by 
magistrate increased from 28 days in 1994 to 63 days in 2003, before dropping 
sharply to 0 days in 2012. A median of 0 days means that at least half of the 
matters were concluded on the same day they were opened.
 
The drop in the total case processing time was due in part to a steady 
decrease in the number of matters declined and to an increase in the number 
of immigration matters disposed by U.S. magistrate beginning in 2004. In 
addition, the increase in immigration enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico 
border was accompanied by a strategy to expedite case processing by charging 
first-time illegal entrants with a petty misdemeanor offense.

Six law enforcement agencies referred 80% 
of matters concluded in 2012
**************************************************

Eighty percent (155,943) of the 196,109 matters concluded by U.S. attorneys 
in 2012 were referred by six federal law enforcement agencies. The top agency 
was from DHS: CBP (66,879 suspects). The FBI referred the second largest 
number of suspects (22,489), followed by ICE (21,266), Citizenship and 
Immigration Services (17,940), DEA (15,865), and ATF (11,504).

Among these six agencies, prosecution rates in 2012 varied from a high of 81% 
for suspects referred by ICE, followed by 76% for suspects referred by DEA 
and 72% for suspects referred by ATF (table 8). Twenty-five percent of 
suspects referred by CBP were prosecuted in U.S. district courts, 75% were 
disposed by U.S. magistrates, and less than 1% were declined. The FBI had a 
prosecution rate of 56%. Five percent of suspects were disposed by U.S. 
magistrate and 39% of matters were declined. These six agencies differed in 
case processing time from receipt of the matter to the decision to prosecute. 
The FBI had a median case processing time of 63 days, compared to 22 to 26 
days for the other five agencies.

**************************************************

Pretrial detention, adjudication, and sentencing
**************************************************

The terms for release and detention of defendants facing charges in federal 
courts are set under Title 18 U.S.C. § 3141. According to the statute, a 
defendant must be brought before a judicial officer without unnecessary delay 
upon arrest for an initial appearance. The judicial officer, usually a U.S. 
magistrate, determines whether the defendant will be released or detained 
prior to trial. The Bail Reform Act of 1984 requires the court to weigh risk 
of flight, threat of crime commission, and presumption of innocence in 
deciding whether to order detention or release of a defendant. According to 
the act, preventive detention is applicable in instances where the defendant 
was charged with (1) a crime of violence, (2) an offense with a statutory 
maximum sentence of life imprisonment or death, (3) a drug offense with a 
statutory maximum sentence of 10 years or more imprisonment, or (4) any 
felony offense if the defendant had been convicted on two or more occasions 
of a previously described offense or a similar state-level offense. 

Most immigration defendants were detained 
prior to case disposition
**************************************************

In 2012, more than 3 in 4 defendants (77%) in cases terminated had been 
detained by the court prior to case disposition (table 9). The defendants 
most likely to be detained were those charged with immigration (88%), weapons 
(86%), violent (84%), and drug (84%) offenses. Immigration defendants made up 
40% of all defendants in cases terminated in 2012 and 46% of all defendants 
detained prior to case disposition. Property (37%) and public order (46%) 
defendants were less likely than other defendants to be detained. In 2012, 
76% of defendants charged with a sex offense were detained prior to case 
disposition.

The likelihood of being detained prior to case 
disposition increased with the number 
of prior convictions 
**************************************************

Eighty-five percent of defendants with five or more prior convictions were 
detained in 2012, compared to 84% of defendants with two to four prior 
convictions, 81% with one prior conviction, and 67% with no prior 
convictions. The likelihood of being detained also increased with the 
severity of the defendant’s criminal history. Eighty-eight percent of 
defendants with a prior violent felony conviction were detained by the court, 
compared to defendants with only a prior felony (other drug or violent) (80%) 
or misdemeanor (79%) conviction. Eighty-five percent of defendants charged in 
U.S.-Mexico border districts were detained prior to case disposition in 2012, 
while 69% were detained in other districts.

Defendants charged with immigration offenses 
increased from 1994 to 2010 and declined 
in 2011 and 2012
**************************************************

Immigration offenses accounted for 76% of the total increase among all felony 
cases filed from 1994 to 2012 (figure 9). After increasing from 21,871 cases 
filed in 1994 to 32,897 Footnote 1 The number of felony cases filed increased 
by 29,000 cases between 1994 and 2012. Immigration (22,790) made up 76% of 
the total growth.*** cases filed in 2003, drug offenses declined to 29,493 in 
2010 before increasing to 32,227 in 2011 and decreasing to 30,292 in 2012. 
Weapons offenses increased from 3,557 cases filed in 1994 to a peak of 10,278 
in 2004, then declined to 7,627 in 2012.

More than half of defendants charged in U.S. 
district courts in 2012 were U.S. citizens
**************************************************

In 2012, 57% of defendants charged in U.S. district court were U.S. citizens. 
Noncitizens charged included persons with legal status (5%) (i.e., permanent 
residents, persons in possession of a green card, persons with a valid 
temporary visa, and persons with refugee status) and persons in the country 
without legal authorization (39%). Of the 43% of defendants who were 
noncitizens, 34% were from Mexico, followed by persons from Central America 
(5%), the Caribbean (2%), and South America (1%). Defendants from Asia and 
Oceania, Europe, and Africa together represented 1% of defendants charged in 
U.S. district court (figure 10).

More than half of defendants charged in U.S. 
district courts in 2012 were of Hispanic origin
**************************************************

In 2012, most defendants charged in U.S. district court were Hispanic (56%) 
and ages 25 to 44 (65%) (table 10). Defendants age 50 or older accounted for 
13% of defendants charged. The youngest (age 19 or younger) and oldest (age 
65 or older) defendants together composed 3% of defendants charged in 2012.

Most defendants charged in U.S. court 
in 2012 were males
**************************************************

Males made up 86% of defendants charged in federal court in 2012. Most males 
charged were of Hispanic origin (58%), followed by white (20%) and black or 
African American (19%). In comparison, most females charged were of Hispanic 
origin (42%), followed by white (34%) and black (19%) females. The median age 
for females (36 years) was similar to males (34 years). Females charged were 
mostly U.S. citizens (78%), with 6% having legal alien status and 16% having 
illegal alien status. Males charged were more evenly split between U.S. 
citizens (53%) and non U.S. citizens (47%). Thirty-nine percent of males 
charged in U.S district court were from Mexico, followed by those from 
Central America (5%), the Caribbean (2%), and South America (1%). Sixteen 
percent of females charged were from Mexico, followed by those from Central 
America (2%), the Caribbean (1%), and South America (1%).

9 in 10 defendants adjudicated in U.S. district 
court were convicted in 2012
**************************************************

Of the 96,260 defendants adjudicated in 2012, 91% were convicted (table 11). 
Almost all immigration violation defendants (97%) in 2012 were convicted, as 
were most defendants with sex offenses (95%), weapons (93%), and drug 
violations (92%). Of the 96,260 adjudicated defendants convicted in 2012, 
most (89%) were convicted following a guilty plea. 

8% of adjudicated defendants were dismissed 
in 2012
**************************************************

Misdemeanants had the highest percentage of dismissals (27%), followed by 
public order (11%) and other property (11%) offenses. Violent offenses (7%) 
and regulatory offenses (5%) had the highest percentage of trials. In 2012, 
defendants adjudicated in U.S.-Mexico border districts had a higher 
conviction rate (95%) than defendants in districts not located on the border 
(89%). Dismissals (a median of 245 days) and guilty pleas (202 days) took 
less time to process than trials ending in conviction (505 days) or ending in 
acquittal (281 days). 

In 2012, a felony case took a median of 206 days 
to process from filing to disposition
**************************************************

The median case processing time for felonies from case filing to disposition 
increased from 197 days in 1994 to 221 days in 2012 (figure 11). Guilty pleas 
made up 89% of the case outcomes, which influenced the overall median case 
processing time. The median case processing time of felony cases terminated 
by a guilty plea increased by 29 days, from 184 days in 1994 to 213 days in 
2012, and remained the disposition with the fastest case time. 

Cases terminated by a bench or jury trial decision 
took the longest time to process
**************************************************

In 2012, felony cases terminated by a trial took a median of 483 days, a 76% 
increase from 274 days in 1994. Cases terminated by dismissal took a median 
of 329 days in 2012, up from 223 days in 1994, or a 48% increase in median 
case processing time.
  
The number of guilty pleas increased by an annual average rate of 2% from 
2008 to 2012 (table 12). The number of defendants who were found guilty 
following a bench trial (down 5%) or a jury trial (down 6%) declined the 
most, on average, from 2008 to 2012. The number of defendants who were 
dismissed decreased annually by 1% from 2008 to 2012.

The percent of felony cases disposed ending 
in a guilty plea varied by district
**************************************************

In 2012, nine federal districts disposed of felony cases with a guilty plea 
95% or more of the time (map 6). This included districts along the U.S.-
Mexico border (with the exception of California Southern) and the districts 
of Wyoming (97%), Illinois Southern (97%), and Rhode Island (96%). 

In 2012, the median time from case filing to 
guilty plea was more than 6 months
**************************************************

Of the 85,774 defendants in cases terminated in 2012 that ended in a guilty 
plea, the median time from case filing to plea was about 202 days (figure 
12). Defendants pleading guilty to a felony public order offense took the 
longest to reach disposition (a median of 332 days), followed by defendants 
pleading guilty to drug, weapons, sex, and violent offenses. Defendants 
pleading guilty to a felony immigration offense took 120 days from case 
filing to case termination. Defendants pleading guilty to a misdemeanor took 
55 days, compared to defendants pleading guilty to a felony (202 days). 
Defendants pleading guilty in U.S.-Mexico border districts (a median of 133 
days) were quicker to reach disposition than defendants pleading guilty in 
other districts (264 days).

77% of convicted defendants were sentenced 
to prison in 2012
**************************************************

Of the 87,908 defendants convicted in U.S. district court in 2012, 77% were 
sentenced to prison (table 13). This percentage is similar to the 79% of 
convicted defendants sentenced to prison in 2008. The number of persons who 
were sentenced to prison increased from 64,529 in 2008 to 67,582 in 2012.

Ten percent of convicted defendants in 2012 (9,090 out of 87,908) were 
sentenced to a term of probation only, down from 12% in 2008. Persons 
sentenced to probation decreased from 9,526 in 2008 to 9,090 in 2012. Two 
percent of defendants were ordered only to pay a fine in 2012. Persons 
receiving a fine-only sentence decreased from 2,803 in 2008 to 1,985 in 2012. 
The fastest growing outcome at sentencing from 2008 to 2012 was a suspended 
sentence, which increased an annual average of 15%. In 2012, about 10% of all 
convicted defendants received a suspended sentence, up from 6% in 2008. 

Defendants convicted of sex offenses were most 
likely to receive a prison sentence 
**************************************************

In 2012, sex offense convictions (97%) were most likely to receive a prison 
sentence, followed by violent and weapons offenses (92% each) and drug 
offenses (91%). Defendants convicted of other property offenses (53%) and 
regulatory public order offenses (54%) were least likely to receive a prison 
sentence. Defendants convicted in one of the five U.S.-Mexico border 
districts (81%) were more likely than defendants in all other districts (75%) 
to receive a prison sentence.

Median prison terms increased slightly 
from 2008 to 2012
**************************************************

The median prison sentence decreased from 33 months in 2008 to 30 months in 
2012. Drug offenders received a median prison sentence of 60 months in 2012, 
which was unchanged from 2008. Violent offenders received a median of 65 
months in prison in 2012, down from 63 months in 2008. Weapons offenders 
received a median sentence of 51 months in 2012, down from 60 months in 2008. 
The median prison sentence decreased for immigration offenders, from 18 
months in 2008 to 16 months in 2012.

Median prison sentences for defendants convicted 
of sex offenses had the greatest increase
**************************************************

Defendants convicted and sentenced to prison for a felony sex offense had the 
greatest median prison sentence in 2012 (96 months), up from a median term of 
36 months in 1994 (figure 13). From 1994 to 2012, the median prison term 
imposed on sex offenders increased by an annual average of 6%. In comparison, 
the median prison term imposed for violent, weapons, and drug offenses 
remained relatively stable during this period. The median prison term imposed 
for immigration offenses decreased from 24 months in 1994 to 16 months in 
2012.

Corrections and post-conviction supervision
**************************************************

Most persons were incarcerated in federal prison 
for a drug offense in 2012
**************************************************

Drug offenses were the most prevalent offense type of prisoners in federal 
prison on September 30, 2012 (figure 14). Drug offenders declined from 57% of 
the prison population in 2002 to 51% in 2012, while weapons offenders 
increased from 10% of the prison population in 2002 to 15% in 2012. The share 
of violent offenders in federal prison decreased from 9% in 2002 to 5% in 
2012. Immigration offenders made up 12% of the prison population in 2012, 
rising slightly from 11% of the prison population in 2002.

Males made up 94% of inmates in 2012
**************************************************

The average annual rate of growth from 2002 to 2012 was slightly greater for 
males (3.3%) than for females (2.4%)(table 14). The percentage of males (94%) 
in federal prison on September 30, 2012, was slightly greater than the 
percentage of males in prison on September 30, 2002 (93%). 

Federal prisons housed a greater share 
of older prisoners in 2012
**************************************************
 
The median age of prisoners was 38 years in 2012, compared to a median age of 
36 years in 2002. The number of prisoners age 65 or older more than doubled 
during this period, from 1,805 prisoners in 2002 to 4,271 prisoners in 2012. 
Offenders age 60 or older accounted for about 5% of the total prison 
population in 2012, compared to 3% in 2002.

From 2002 to 2012, American Indian or Alaska 
Natives and Hispanics in federal prison had 
the greatest average annual increases
**************************************************

In 2012, 35% of the federal prison population was black, 35% was Hispanic, 
and 27% was white. American Indians or Alaska Natives (2%) and Asians, Native 
Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islanders (1%) made up the remainder of the prison 
population. American Indian offenders had the greatest average annual 
increase from 2002 to 2012 (5%), followed by Hispanic offenders (4%). 
Seventy-four percent of persons in federal prison at fiscal yearend 2012 were 
U.S. citizens, up from 72% in 2002 (figure 15). Of the 26% non U.S. citizens 
in federal prison in 2012, 19% were citizens of Mexico, 3% were citizens of 
Caribbean countries, 2% were citizens of Central America, and 1% were 
citizens of South American countries. Non U.S. citizens in federal prison at 
fiscal yearend 2012 with citizenship in a Central American country increased 
by an annual average of 9% from 2002 to 2012. In comparison, the annual 
average growth in prisoners who were citizens of Mexico was 4%. The number of 
prisoners from South America declined, from 4,054 in 2002 to 2,519 in 2012 (a 
5% annual average decrease). Five federal judicial districts (Arizona, Texas 
Western, Texas Southern, Florida Southern, and Florida Middle) committed 20% 
of offenders in federal prison at yearend 2012 (map 7).

**************************************************************
**************************************************
Offenders returning to federal prison 
from 1998 to 2012
**************************************************

15% of offenders released from federal prison 
in 2010 returned to federal prison within 3 years
**************************************************

Five percent of offenders released in 2012 returned to federal prison within 
1 year, 11% of offenders released in 2011 returned to federal prison with 2 
years, 15% of offenders released in 2010 were returned to federal prison 
within 3 years, 18% of offenders released in 2009 returned within 4 years, 
and 19% of offenders released in 2008 returned within 5 years (figure 16). 
These recidivism percentages do not take into account the recidivism of 
offenders who, after release from federal prison, were imprisoned in a state 
prison for a new offense.

Supervision violations were the most common 
reason for return to prison within 3 years
**************************************************

The most common reason for federal prisoners released in 2010 to return to 
federal prison within 3 years was violation of conditions of supervision 
(54%). Returns for a new court commitment or new offense accounted for 43% of 
returns (table 15). 

Return-to-prison rates were highest for younger 
released offenders
**************************************************

Offenders ages 18 to 24 who were released in 2010 had a 3-year return-to-
prison rate of 21%. Of these returns, 55% was for a supervision violation and 
44% was for a new court commitment. Among released prisoners ages 25 to 44, 
16% returned to prison within 3 years, as did 11% of prisoners ages 45 to 64 
and 4% of prisoners age 65 or older.

Males had a 16% 3-year return-to-prison rate, 
compared to 9% for female offenders
**************************************************
 
Among males who were released from federal prison in 2010 and returned, 53% 
returned for violations of supervision and 44% returned for a new court 
commitment. In comparison, 76% of females returned to prison for supervision 
violations and 22% returned with a new court commitment.
 
American Indian or Alaska Native prisoners had 
the highest 3-year return-to-prison rate among 
all racial and ethnic groups
**************************************************

Forty-two percent of American Indian or Alaska Natives first released from 
federal prison in 2010 returned to federal prison within 3 years. Eighty-
seven percent of American Indians returned for a violation of supervision, 
and 12% returned for a new court commitment. Black prisoners had the second 
highest 3-year return-to-prison rate (19%), with 79% returned for supervision 
violations and 12% returned for a new court commitment. White prisoners had a 
13% return rate, Hispanic prisoners had a 14% return rate, and Asian, Native 
Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander prisoners had a 6% return rate.

Violent and weapons offenders returned to prison 
at higher rates than other offenders
**************************************************

The 3-year return-to-prison rate was highest for violent (31%) and weapons 
(25%) offenders (figure 17). Weapons (90%) and sex offenses (89%) were most 
likely to be returned for supervision violations. Immigration offenders were 
most likely to be returned for a new offense (84%). As most immigration 
offenders were deported after serving a federal sentence, most who returned 
did so for illegally reentering the United States.


Immigration offenders made up the largest number 
returning to federal prison within 3 years 
of first release
**************************************************

Seventeen percent of immigration offenders released in 2010 were returned to 
federal prison within 3 years of release, representing 40% of all recidivists 
over the time period. In comparison, 24% of recidivists were drug offenders 
and 5% were violent offenders. Immigration had the highest percentage of new 
offenses as a reason for return to federal prison (84%), and 16% of 
immigration returns were due to supervision violations. Immigration was the 
most common offense type of returns for new offenses. 

The 3-year recidivism rate for drug offenders was 11%. Seventeen percent of 
drug offenders were returned for a new offense, and 72% were returned for a 
supervision violation. Property and drug offenses had the lowest 3-year 
return-to-prison rate (each 11%). Thirteen percent of property offenders were 
returned for a new offense, and 87% were returned for a supervision 
violation.

18% of U.S. citizens and 12% of non-U.S. citizens 
released in 2010 returned to federal priso
within 3 years
**************************************************

Non-U.S. citizens had a lower return rate (12%) than U.S. citizens (18%). The 
lower risk of return for non-U.S. citizens may be a function of differences 
in how non-U.S. citizen offenders are handled following release. Most non-
U.S. citizens are deported immediately after serving a federal prison term. 
Noncitizens may then be deported or detained pending deportation by ICE. A 
small share of noncitizens is released to serve terms of federal supervision, 
so most noncitizens would not be at risk to return to prison for technical 
violations of supervision. About 9 in 10 noncitizens who returned to prison 
in a 3-year period following first release were recommitted for a new court 
commitment, and 1 in 10 were returned for a supervision violation.

Districts with the highest 3-year return-to-prison 
rate for new court commitments only were clustered 
in the west and southwestern United States
**************************************************

The districts of California Southern, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas Southern 
had 3-year return-to-prison rates for a new offense of 8% or more in 2012 
(map 8). In 2012, eight districts had 3-year return-to-prison rates of 19% or 
more for supervision violations (map 9). Three of these districts are 
adjacent to one another: Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota.
**************************************************************

At fiscal yearend 2012, a total of 131,732 
offenders were under active federal post-conviction 
supervision
**************************************************

Eighty-three percent of offenders under federal post-conviction supervision 
received one of two forms of supervision following release from prison: 
supervised release (107,802) or parole (1,623) (table 16). The remainder 
(22,307) were on probation supervision, which is a sentence to a term of 
supervision in the community with and without a confinement sentence. Among 
the 131,732 offenders under federal supervision at the end of fiscal year 
2012, 81% were male and 19% were female. Females made up 37% of offenders on 
probation and 2% of offenders on parole supervision. Black offenders and 
white offenders both accounted for 36% of persons under supervision, followed 
by Hispanic offenders (22%). Black offenders made up 38% of offenders on 
supervised release, and white offenders made up nearly half (47%) of 
offenders on probation.

6% of persons under federal post-conviction 
supervised release in the community were 
non-U.S. citizens
**************************************************

In 2012, 6% of offenders under federal supervision were non U.S. citizens. 
Hispanic offenders accounted for 22% of offenders under community. The median 
age was similar for offenders under supervised release (age 39) and probation 
(age 40), but higher for persons on parole supervision (age 52).
Drug and property fraud were the two most common offenses for offenders under 
federal supervision in 2002 and in 2012 (figure 18). The percentage of 
weapons offenders under federal supervision increased from 2002 and 2012, as 
did drug and immigration offenders.

Methodology
**************

The Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP)
**************************************************

This report uses data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) Federal 
Justice Statistics Program (FJSP). The FJSP was initiated in 1982 to serve as 
a central resource for information describing the case processing of federal 
criminal defendants and to meet BJS’s statutory mandate to “collect, analyze, 
and disseminate comprehensive federal justice transaction statistics … and to 
provide technical assistance to and work jointly with other federal agencies 
to improve the availability and quality of federal justice data”—42 U.S.C. 
3732 (c) (15). 

The FJSP receives administrative data files from six federal criminal justice 
agencies and standardizes this information to maximize comparability across 
agencies and within agencies over time. This includes (1) applying, where 
possible, person-case as the primary unit of count (exceptions include at 
arrest where the unit of count is the individual suspect, sentencing under 
federal sentencing guidelines where the unit of count is the sentencing 
event, and at imprisonment where the unit of count is the inmate); (2) 
delineating fiscal year (October 1 through September 30) as the period for 
reported events; (3) applying a uniform offense classification across 
agencies; and (4) classifying disposition and sentences imposed.
 
Where more than one offense is charged or adjudicated, the most serious 
offense at disposition and sentencing is used. Offense seriousness is based 
on maximum statutory imprisonment term, type of crime, and statutory maximum 
fine amount. Annual cross-sectional data files are produced and maintained by 
and represent the federal criminal case processing stages from arrest and 
prosecution through pretrial release, adjudication, sentencing, appeals, and 
corrections. 

FJSP data sources
**********************

The U.S. Marshals Service Prisoner Tracking System (PTS) provides information 
on suspects arrested for federal offenses and booked by the U.S. Marshals 
Service following an arrest. Suspects may be counted more than once in a 
fiscal year if they are arrested and booked multiple times during the period. 
The U.S. Marshals Service uses the PTS to track federal prisoners in U.S. 
Marshals Service custody. The U.S. Marshals Service provides data from the 
Justice Detainee Information System (JDIS). The JDIS consolidates information 
on prisoners who are in Marshals Service custody or who have a federal arrest 
warrant issued. 

The Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys’ National Legal Information Office 
Network System (LIONS) database contains information on the investigation and 
prosecution of suspects in criminal matters received and concluded and 
criminal cases filed and terminated by U.S. attorneys. Suspects may be 
counted more than once in a fiscal year if they are involved in multiple 
matters received and concluded during the period. A matter is defined as a 
referral where an attorney spends an hour or more investigating. The lead 
charge is used to classify the most serious offense at referral and is 
defined as the substantive statute that is the primary basis of referral.
 
The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts’ (AOUSC) criminal master file 
contains information about the criminal proceedings against defendants whose 
cases were filed and terminated in U.S. district courts. These data include 
information on cases involving felonies, and Class A and B misdemeanors 
handled by U.S. district court judges. The most serious filing or terminating 
offense is the offense charge that yields the greatest maximum statutory 
penalty. This report also uses AOUSC data from the Probation and Pretrial 
Services Automated Case Tracking System (PACTS), which contains information 
on defendants interviewed and supervised by pretrial services. These data are 
used to describe background characteristics of defendants arraigned and 
defendants detained prior to case disposition. In addition, post-conviction 
data from the AOUSC’s Federal Probation Supervision Information System 
(FPSIS) are used to describe immigration offenders under post-conviction 
supervision in the community. 

The Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) SENTRY database contains information on 
all sentenced offenders admitted into or released from federal prison during 
a fiscal year, and offenders in federal prison at the end of each fiscal year 
(September 30). The most serious commitment offense is the offense with the 
longest sentence length. All percentage changes referred to in this report 
are calculated using the average of the annual change between the two 
reported years

Returns to federal prison
****************************
 
The number of offenders returning to federal prison is a count of the number 
of federal prisoners who returned to federal prison after first release from 
a U.S. district court commitment. Prisoners released from federal prison for 
the first time between 1998 and 2012 were identified. The BOP’s SENTRY 
database was searched for a subsequent return to federal prison. Prisoners 
released in 2010 were the most recent cohort that could be tracked for 3 
years following release through 2013. In addition, observation windows were 
included for 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year return rates following first release. 
The return-to-prison rate increases with the length of the window used to 
follow-up on prisoners. The unit of analysis is the first release from 
federal prison, and the return rates are computed based on the number of 
first releases.
 
In 2010, 61,374 federally sentenced prisoners were released from the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons. This cohort of offenders was tracked for 3 years following 
release to count the number who returned to federal prison, whether for a new 
offense or a supervision violation.

Detailed data tables are available in Federal Justice Statistics, 2011 – 
Statistical Tables (NCJ 248469, BJS web, December 2014) and Federal Justice 
Statistics, 2012 –Statistical Tables (NCJ 248470, BJS web, December 2014). 
FJSP data are also incorporated into a BJS web query tool that permits users
