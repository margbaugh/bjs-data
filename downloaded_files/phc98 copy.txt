*Original Brady States were 32 States required to follow presale
review procedures set out in the Brady Act when it became
effective  on February 28, 1994.  At the end of the Brady
interim period (11/29/98), 23 of the 32 were still Brady States.
(See table 2.)


* During the first 11 months of 1998, about 70,000 (2.9%) of an
estimated 2,384,000 applications to purchase a handgun were
rejected due to presale background checks of the potential
handgun purchaser.

* About 63% of the rejections were for a prior felony conviction
or a current felony indictment.  Domestic violence misdemeanor
convictions accounted for 10% of the rejections; domestic
violence protection orders, 3%.

* On November 30, 1998, the permanent provisions of the Brady
Act became effective, requiring presale background checks for
the sale of all firearms (not just handguns) through the FBI's
National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).

* Including December 1998, the first month of the permanent
provisions of the Brady Act, the number of handgun application
rejections totaled an estimated 78,000 for the 12 months of
1998.

* From the inception of the Brady Act in March 1994 to November 1998, 
approximately 312,000 handgun applications were rejected as a result of 
background checks; from March 1994 to December 1998, approximately 320,000 
were rejected.

* During the first month of the permanent provisions, the FBI
conducted 506,554 background checks on potential firearm buyers.
 The State points of contact made an additional 386,286 checks.

The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (P.L. 103-159,
November 30, 1993) provided for an interim period from February
28, 1994, through November 29, 1998, before its permanent
provisions became effective. The period permitted the U.S.
Department of Justice time to establish the National Instant
Criminal Background Check System (NICS).  Operating primarily
through telephones and computers, NICS indexes and accesses
relevant criminal justice agency databases.

During the 57-month interim period, the Brady Act required
federally licensed firearm dealers (FFLs) to request a presale
background check of potential handgun purchasers.  These
requests were made to the Chief Law Enforcement Officer (CLEO)
of the jurisdiction where the FFL operated.  The CLEO had 5 days
to respond.  The 12.7 million background checks resulted in
about 312,000 rejections, a rejection rate of 2.4%. 

On November 30, 1998, the permanent provisions of the Brady Act
became effective.  All FFLs must request a presale background
check of potential purchasers of all firearms, both handguns and
long guns. 

The Firearm Inquiry Statistics (FIST) program administered by BJS 
collected the data.  FIST was initiated in 1994 to describe presale 
background checks of applicants to buy a handgun from a FFL.  CLEOs 
made the checks in accordance with the Brady Act or comparable State
legislation.  FIST does not include information on appeals to
rejected applications.

During the first 11 months of 1998, about 2,384,000 background
checks of potential handgun buyers prevented an estimated 70,000
purchases, a rejection rate of 2.9% (Highlights).  The most
prevalent reason for rejection of a handgun purchase was that
the applicant was either under felony indictment or had been
convicted of a felony (63.3%) (table 1).

*Includes illegal aliens, juveniles, persons discharged from the armed services
dishonorably, persons who have renounced their U.S. citizenship, and other unspeci-
fied persons.  At the end of November 1998, 23 of the 32 original Brady States were
still under the Brady Act. Firearm Inquiry Statistics information covers only the 50
States; National Criminal History Improvement Program information on pages 6
and 7 includes States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. Territories.
 
 
Denials owing to domestic violence offenses or restraining orders (13.3%) 
and State lw prohibitions (6.6%) were the next most common reasons
for rejection.

When the interim period began there were 32 original Brady
States and 18 Brady-alternative States, as classified by the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).  At the end of
the period, there were 23 Brady States and 27 Brady-alternative
States.  

For the first 11 months of 1998, original Brady States rejected
47,000 handgun applicants.  Current Brady States rejected
29,000. Two-thirds of the rejections in the original Brady
States in 1998 were due to felony indictment or convictions, 
compared to slightly more than half of the rejections in current 
Brady States. 

From March 1994 to November 1998, an estimated 12.7 million
handgun purchase applications were submitted to CLEOs, of which
about 312,000 were rejected.  Two-thirds (207,000) were rejected
because the applicant had been convicted of a felony or was
under a felony indictment at the time the application was
processed.

During this period the original Brady States processed more than
7.2 million applications, rejecting 203,000 (2.8%). Sixty-four
percent of the applicants rejected in these States had been convicted 
of a felony or were under a felony indictment.

In 1998 all of the States maintained databases that record past
felony convictions, and many States retained databases of other
disqualifying information, such as fugitive status, court
restraining orders, mental illness, and domestic violence
misdemeanor convictions (table 2).

Note:  Not all States that reported having a database reported reasons for rejections.
a/In the Brady States contacts were the chief law enforcement officers; in Brady-alternative
States these contacts were identified according to criteria of each State.
b/Background checks were required for handguns and long guns.
 
 

In some States  information is not available at the State level for 
statewide dissemination, but some local CLEOs, courts, or other local 
agencies within the State maintain automated databases of this type of 
information. Some States have other data files related to their own
prohibitions.  Beginning November 30, 1998, background checks
that are handled entirely by the FBI's NICS may not access all
of the State-level files. (See the discussion of NICS, page 8.)


Statewide reporting of handgun applications 
and rejections, 1998


State governments, the FBI, and ATF cooperated to identify about
5,400 law enforcement agencies to serve as CLEOs.  Among the
CLEOs responding to this survey, 18 served as the only CLEO for
their State and provided statewide totals for January to
November 1998 (table 3).

Note:  Each State had 1 CLEO that reported
complete statewide data for applications
and rejections for January through November 1998.
Seven other States contributed data
but could not be included for various reasons.
*Counts in this table include handguns and long guns.

The 18 States represented 47% of the U.S. population and 46% of
the total applications processed during the 11- month period. 
They processed 1,103,683 applications and rejected 28,349; a
rejection rate of 2.6%.

The reasons for rejection included the 
following:

The interim period: cumulative 
summary and significant events

ATF calculated the number of applications for firearm purchases
from March 1994 to the end of 1995.  (See Presale Firearm
Checks, BJS Bulletin, NCJ 162787, February 1997.)

When data collection for FIST began in January 1996, the
estimated number of inquiries for handgun purchases during that
year was 67% of the total number of firearm inquiries ("F" code)
to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), approximately
3,842,000.  To estimate the number of inquiries for handgun
purchase applications before 1996, ATF estimates were multiplied
by 67%.  After the first 10 months of the interim period, the
number of  NCIC "F" code counts per 100,000 adult U.S. residents
remained relatively consistent:

            1995        2,083
            1996        1,957
            1997        1,984
Jan.-Nov.   1998        1,927

*January and February were imputed, 
using the average of those months, 1995-97.


The ATF estimates for 1994 and 1995 were calculated using the
number of firearm-coded inquiries to NCIC.  The percentage of
denials used for those estimates was based on the experiences of
jurisdictions that had implemented presale firearms check
procedures before the Brady Act.

On average each year from 1994 to 1998 States reported 34
statutory changes dealing with firearms (tables 4 and 5).

Notes:  In 1994 and 1995 the estimate of handgun inquiries/applications was based on 67% of "F" counts, and the
rejection rate was that of previously implemented State check systems.  National estimates from 1996 to 1998 are
based on national surveys.  The NICS largely replaced "F" code inquiries, which will be discontinued in 1999.

c/The number of applications was reduced from 2,671,000, based on a special study of Indiana's combined
reporting of licenses and applications, which reduced the published count by 97,000.  There was no impact on
the published 1997 rejection rate.
 

Over the same period the estimated number of
inquiries about the criminal histories of handgun buyers
remained stable at around 2.5 million.  Except for 1995, the
estimated rate of rejection to those inquiries was between 2.5%
and 2.9%.

Inquiries to the FBI regarding weapons, the "F" counts,
also varied relatively little, with a high of 4 million in 1995 and
a low of 3.6 million in 1998.


Events during the interim period

1994 The Bureau of Justice Statistics initiated the National
Criminal History Program (NCHIP) to provide funds to States to
improve criminal history operations.  Five States passed
legislation that moved them from Brady status to alternative
status, and significant  changes in State firearm laws were made.

1995 Several sheriffs filed suit in federal court to contest
mandatory State participation in the Brady handgun checks,
resulting in a Supreme Court decision in 1997. Two more States 
moved to Brady-alternative status, and in other States significant 
changes in the law took effect.

1996 The "Lautenberg Amendment" to the Federal Gun Control Act
(GCA) became effective in October.  It prohibits persons
convicted of a misdemeanor of domestic violence from purchasing
firearms.  State and local CLEOs began to implement the
amendment's provisions in their background check procedures. 
Thirty-one significant State laws took effect, and two more
States attained alternative status.

1997 On June 27 the Supreme Court ruled that State
participation in the Brady checks must not be mandatory (see
Printz v United States, 521 U.S. 98, 117 S.Ct. 2365 (1997). As
a result, some smaller agencies ceased activity, and FIST
adjusted its national estimate to account for the decision. 
California implemented its paperless process for firearm checks.
 
1998 The permanent provisions of the Brady Act took effect on
November 30, resulting in the FBI's implementation of the NICS.  
In addition to handguns, background checks for long guns and pawn 
redemptions were required.


Rejections during the interim period

The FIST data can be used to compare reasons for rejections in
1996, 1997, and the first 11 months of 1998.  For all States,
when reason for rejection was specified, the most prevalent
reason was that the applicant was either indicted for or
convicted of a felony (67.8% in 1996, 61.7% in 1997, and 63.3%
in the first 11 months of 1998).

In 1997 and the first 11 months of 1998, a misdemeanor
conviction for domestic violence (9.1% and 9.9% respectively)
was the next most prevalent reason for rejection of a handgun
purchase.  This category was added as a prohibition in October
1996.  Prior to that time, being a violator of a State law
prohibition had ranked third among specific reasons for
rejection; afterwards, it ranked fourth (table 6).

Background

Federal prohibitions

The Federal Gun Control Act (GCA), as codified at 18 U.S.C. 922,
prohibits the transfer of any firearm to any person who -

* is under indictment for, or has been   convicted of, a crime
punishable by imprisonment for more than 1 year
* is a fugitive from justice
* is an unlawful user of or addicted to any controlled substance
* has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a
mental institution
* is a juvenile
* is an alien unlawfully in the United States
* was discharged from the armed forces under dishonorable
conditions
* has renounced United States citizenship
* is subject to a court order restraining him or her from
harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or child or  
* has been convicted in any court of a misdemeanor crime of
domestic violence.

Additionally, among other provisions, the GCA  makes it unlawful
for any licensed importer, manufacturer, dealer, or collector to
transfer a long gun to a person less than 18 years of age or any
other firearm to a person less than 21 years of age.  (For
further detail see the full text of the GCA on the ATF website
listed on page 12.)

Many States, prior to the Brady Act, imposed procedural or
prohibitory requirements beyond the minimal requirements of
Federal law.  (See Survey of State Procedures Related to Firearm
Sales, 1997, BJS report, NCJ 173942,  December 1998).  These
States, under the Brady Act, were allowed to continue their
operations.

Interim Brady Act provisions

The interim provisions of the Brady Act prohibited sale of a
handgun by a FFL for 5 days or until the licensee had been
advised that, based on a background check, a prospective
purchaser was not prohibited from purchase under Federal or
State law.  Thirty-two States (identified as original Brady
States) and Puerto Rico were required to follow the review
procedures at the start of this interim period.

The interim provisions of the Brady Act also allowed States with
prohibitory statutes comparable to Federal law to follow a
variety of alternative procedures.  The Brady-alternative States
generally employed either an "instant check" or a "permit or
other approval-type" system (as designated by the ATF).  By the
end of 1996, the number of States following the Brady Act review
procedures rather than alternative State statutes, had dropped
to 23 (table 2).

When the U.S. Supreme Court negated mandatory background checks
by CLEOs in Brady States, most CLEOs in the Brady States 
voluntarily conducted the checks.  In Brady-alternative States, 
checks continued in accordance with State law.  The impact of 
this decision on making a national estimate of presale handgun 
checks is addressed in Methodology.

Changes in State firearm laws since the 
effective date of the Brady Act

After passage of the Brady Act, numerous States enacted
legislation to implement the Act's interim and permanent
provisions.  State firearm sale regulations in existence before
passage of the Brady Act were also frequent subjects of
legislative amendments.

A minimum of 14 States enacted laws intended to prohibit certain
categories of persons from purchasing, receiving, possessing or
transferring firearms (table 5).  Most new State prohibitions
involve persons who --

* were convicted of a felony, violent misdemeanor, or other
specified offense;
* have committed offenses involving drugs or alcohol;
* are under the age at which firearm possession is allowed;
* were adjudicated delinquent or committed offenses as
juveniles; or
* have not completed a firearm safety course.

Eight States modified procedures for restoration of the right to
possess a firearm.  In addition to prohibiting purchases by
domestic violence offenders, seven States enacted new
legislation to permit court-ordered seizure of firearms from
persons subject to restraining orders.

State statutes requiring permits or other documents to purchase
or carry firearms generated substantial legislative activity
during the interim period.  Four States modified their existing
permit system; one established a new permit or other
approval-type system; nine enacted laws related to carrying a
handgun; and seven increased fees to conduct a record check or
get a permit.  Many of these permits or licenses can be used to
waive purchase requirements such as a new background check or a
waiting period.

Nine States qualified for Brady-alternative status under the
act's interim provisions by enacting new or substantially
amended instant check or permit or other approval-type systems. 
Several other jurisdictions enacted legislation that either
established a statewide system for implementing the national
instant check or expanded the scope of State firearm regulations
to include background checks on long gun purchasers.

National Criminal History Improvement 
Program (NCHIP)

The Brady Act established a grant program (NCHIP) to ensure
immediate availability of complete and accurate State records.
An additional authorization of $20 million was made available
through the National Child Protection Act of 1993 (Public Law
No.103-209, 107 Statute 2490), and $6 million were authorized
under the Violence Against Women Act (42 U.S.C. 13701 et seq.). 
Another $25 million were provided to establish State sex
offender registries as a component of NCHIP.  The program under
which these funds are awarded is designed to assist States to
develop or improve existing criminal history records systems and
to establish an interface with the NICS.

Under NCHIP, over $200 million were given in direct awards to
the States during fiscal years 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998 (table 7).

*Other improvements included juvenile record conversion, offsetting costs of certain types of background checks,
research and evaluation, training, interfacing with the National Incident-Based Reporting System, and so forth.



The appropriation for 1999 is $45 million.  NCHIP funds
have also supported direct technical assistance to States,
evaluation, and research related to improving criminal and other
non-felony records within the States.

As a result of NCHIP, State criminal history databases are
becoming increasingly automated as the number of records kept
continues to grow.  A survey of State criminal history
information systems at yearend 1997 reported 54,210,000 subjects
in manual (7.4 million) and automated (46.8 million) files
nationwide, an increase of over 4.3 million subjects from 1995,
the next most recent year surveyed.  Forty-one States increased
their percentage of automated files during the period.  By
December 31, 1997, 49 States had automated at least some records
in their criminal history record file, 20 States had fully
automated criminal history files, and 45 States had fully
automated master name indexes. Of the States that in 1997 maintained 
partially automated criminal history files, 23 updated a prior manual 
record when the subject was subsequently arrested (up from 19 in 1995). 
(See Survey of State Criminal History Information Systems, 1997,
BJS report, NCJ 175041, April 1999.)

The FIST program was established under NCHIP.  Information
requested from checking agencies does not include data traceable
to an applicant, and none of the FIST information provided from
agencies to BJS contains or reveals the identity of individual
applicants.  The computer program that some agencies used for
both operational purposes and to collect FIST data transmits
only the appropriately aggregated or categorized responses. 
Moreover, the computer program assists agencies to purge records
after the delay specified by law.


National Instant Criminal
Background Check System (NICS)

Permanent Brady Act provisions

The NICS provides national minimum requirements for checking
firearm purchase applications.  Since November 30, 1998, a
licensed dealer can contact the FBI or State point of contact
(POC) and request an immediate response on whether a firearm
transfer would violate Federal or State law.
The NICS became effective November 30, 1998, implementing the
permanent provisions of the Brady Act.  The NICS, at 18 U.S.C.
922(t), allows a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL) to contact the
system by telephone or other electronic means for information on
whether receipt of a firearm by a prospective transferee would
violate Federal or State law.  In addition to regulation of
handgun sales by FFLs, the permanent provisions of the Brady Act
require licensees to request background checks on long gun
purchasers and persons who redeem a pawned firearm.  Licensees
have the option of requesting a NICS check on persons who
attempt to pawn a firearm.

When applying to purchase a firearm from an FFL, prospective
transferees are required to undergo a NICS check or to present a
permit which the ATF has qualified as an alternative to a NICS
check at the point of sale. Qualifying permits are those which - 

1. allow a transferee to possess, 
acquire, or carry a firearm

2. were issued not more than 5 years earlier by the State in
which the transfer is to take place, after verification by an
authorized government official that possession of a firearm by
the transferee would not violate Federal, State, or local law. 

A permit issued after November 30, 1998, qualifies as an
alternative only if the information available to the State
authority includes the NICS check.

A licensee initiates a NICS check at the point of sale by
contacting either the FBI or a State POC.  The FBI or the POC
checks applicable databases and responds with a notice to the
FFL that the transfer may proceed, may not proceed, or is
delayed pending further review of the transferee's record.

State involvement in presale firearm 
checks

Each State determined the extent of its involvement in the NICS
process. Three forms of State involvement currently exist:

1. Full State POC participation - a State POC conducts a NICS check 
(permit or point of sale) on all firearm transfers originating in the State

2. Partial State POC participation - a State POC conducts a NICS check 
(permit or point of sale) on all handgun transfers, with FFLs in the State 
required to contact the FBI for approval of long gun transfers

3. Checks via NICS only - there is no State POC, requiring FFLs
to contact the FBI for NICS checks on all firearm transfers
originating in the State.

Firearms dealers in 23 States request checks on prospective
handgun owners via NICS only, and dealers in 27, via a State POC
(table 8).

Note:  Details of State participation in the
NICS change from time to time.
*The New Mexico State Department of Public
Safety is a temporary POC for dealers not yet
registered with the FBI.
 
 
For transfers of long guns, dealers in 34 States go through NICS 
alone, while those in 16 use a POC.  NICS checks by the FBI are without 
charge; POC fees are determined by State law.   The details of State 
participation in NICS change from time to time.

The NICS process does not supplant State firearm regulations. 
State background check statutes that existed prior to the NICS
remain in force unless they are repealed by legislative action
or allowed to expire.  Six States continue to maintain parallel
systems that require background checks in addition to the NICS.

The FBI and 18 State POCs (those volunteering to provide the
data) conducting NICS background checks reported their December
1998 activity to FIST (table 9).

While a number of States withdrew from background checks, Pennsylvania,
Tennessee, and Vermont became State POCs.  Although California, Colorado,
and New Jersey distinguished between handguns and long guns, many
States ignored the distinction, referring to firearms.

Methodology

Two approaches were used for the collection of data from local
law enforcement agencies.  The first involved an ongoing survey
among CLEOs based on a random sampling procedure.  The second
consisted of telephone contact with remaining local CLEOs in the
U. S. to obtain data from those that collected and would share
information on handgun applications.

Based on data provided by both sets of CLEOs, national estimates
were developed using weighting factors derived from the original
stratification.  When a CLEO did not provide data for all
months, a simple linear extrapolation or interpolation was used to 
generate an 11-month total. 

Ongoing survey

The following presents the approach used to derive the estimates
for January 1, 1998, to November 29, 1998, from a sample of
chief law enforcement officers charged with determining
eligibility to purchase a handgun.

The data were stratified by size of the population served. 
Information collected included the following: (1) handgun
applications made to the CLEO; (2) handgun applications rejected
by the CLEO; and (3) the reasons for rejection.

The sample for the survey was selected from a population of
5,400 CLEOs.  These CLEOs were stratified into: State agencies
which served an entire State population; local CLEOs which
served a population greater than 100,000; local CLEOs which
served a population between 10,000 and 100,000; and local CLEOs
which served a population of less than 10,000.  Population size
was based on 1990 Census information.  The population categories
were chosen to be consistent with those commonly used by the FBI
when conducting similar studies.  A total of 600 CLEOs were
randomly selected for the study.  

From the start of this study to November 29, 1998, three States
implemented operation of statewide CLEOs, and one State began
reporting data for local jurisdictions.  These changes reduced
the total number of CLEOs selected to 563.

The sample universe included 25 statewide CLEOs (Pennsylvania
added during 1998), 113 CLEOs that service populations over
100,000, 184 CLEOs from the 10,000 to 100,000 category, and 241
from the under 10,000 category.  For each State, 4% or a minimum
of five CLEOs were selected in their respective categories.  

Overall, 244 CLEOs provided data - a response rate of 43%.  Respondents 
included 25 statewide CLEOs, 37 local CLEOs serving populations of more 
than 100,000, 88 local CLEOs from the 10,000 to 100,000 category, and 94 
local CLEOs serving under 10,000. 

New Jersey provided data on the number of applications and the
number of rejections for the whole State but did not provide
reasons for rejections.  Local New Jersey CLEOs in the sample
provided data on the reasons for rejection.  For applications,
rejections, and rejection rates, information from the statewide
CLEO was used.  The descriptive information about reasons for
rejections used data from both the local and State CLEOs.  

Maine was one of several States that used both local CLEOs and
the State police in areas not served by a local CLEO.  In the
other States, data from the State police were classified in the
under 10,000  category because of the rural area that was
normally being served.  However, because the State police report
accounted for 40% of Maine and a  wide range of population
classifications, State police data were classified as statewide
data.  

Indiana has two processes under which a person can qualify to
purchase a handgun.  One involves the acquisition of a handgun
license that can be used for multiple purposes including
purchasing a handgun.  The second involves a sales application
at the time of the purchase.  In order to determine which of the
two processes should be used, a special study was conducted of
Indiana's handgun procedures.  This study is available through
the BJS Internet site.  As a result of this study it was decided
that the counts for handgun licenses was the most appropriate
statistic to use for this Bulletin.  Handgun license numbers
were also used for 1996 and 1997 in computing the cumulative
estimates for 1994 through 1998.

Agencies with a rejection rate over four standard deviations
above the average standard rejection rate were classified as
outliers and their data were not used for projection of
estimates.  In addition, agencies were classified as outliers if
their final rejection rate could not be determined with
sufficient accuracy.  The data provided by the outliers were
added to the total estimated counts to get the final national
totals.  

To compensate for the June 1997 Supreme Court decision, the
CLEOs from Brady States that had been selected for this study
were surveyed to determine if they stopped performing background
checks.  For each size category, a percentage of the population
that had stopped participating was computed.  These percentages
were then applied to the estimated number of rejections for that
size category and subtracted from the total estimated number of
rejections.  

The accuracy of the estimates presented in this report depends
on two types of errors: nonsampling and sampling.  In this study,
nonsampling error may occur from the following:  nonresponse;
differences in the ways CLEOs process, code, store, and retrieve
their information; differences in interpretation of the survey 
ques-tions; and even activities which delay personnel from doing 
paperwork.  

Also, the process of a researcher receiving data and storing it
in the computer for analysis can introduce nonsampling error. 
In any sample survey, the full extent of nonsampling error is
never known.  However, steps were taken to minimize the
potential for error.  Extensive telephone follow-ups were made
to encourage responses, answer questions about misunderstood
requests, and generally help CLEOs in assembling the information
in a form useable by FIST.  Extensive verification of the data
ensured the accuracy of the numbers.  

Because of the sampling design, State comparisons cannot be
made.  The estimates are only for the 50 States and do not
include U.S. territories or the District of Columbia.

Supplemental survey

The following presents the approach used to supplement the
ongoing survey among CLEOs.  Telephone contact was attempted in
November 1998, with all agencies not invited to participate in
the ongoing survey.  Also omitted from contact were those
statewide CLEOs reporting directly to FIST and local police
departments within those States.  CLEOs not participating in the
ongoing survey were asked if they collected the following data
in 1998 and would share those data with FIST:  handgun
applications made to the CLEO; handgun applications rejected by
the CLEO; and the reasons for rejection.

Of the CLEOs that said they collected and maintained data, 512
agreed to send to FIST the data they had collected in the period
from January through November. Simple linear extrapolation or
interpolation was used to supply an 11-month total for those
CLEOs that could supply only a portion of November or had data
missing for previous months of 1998.

CLEOs in this supplemental survey served a population between
10,000 and 100,000 or served a population of less than 10,000,
based on 1990 census information.  All local CLEOs serving a
population greater than 100,000 had been asked to participate in
the ongoing survey, as had all CLEOs that served an entire State
population.  The number of CLEOs in the ongoing survey were
compared with those of the supplemental survey by population
category and U.S. region.

The supplemental survey increased the number of the smallest
agencies in the study from 94 to 444, and those serving a
population between 10,000 and 100,000 from 88 to 250.  These
increases were not concentrated in any particular region, but
were distributed across all regions.

The agencies in the supplemental survey and those in the
ongoing survey together served a population of  179,061,298 (72%
of the 248,102,973 population identified in the 1990 census).

The addition of CLEOs did not skew the distribution of agencies
toward any particular region or regions, and improved representation in
the Northeast and South.  A relative balance in terms of population was 
also maintained.  Moreover, the supplement addressed the issue of agencies 
dropping out of the study over time.  Between 1996 and 1998, the number 
of CLEOs participating in the ongoing survey fell from 311 to 244.  Two 
factors were chiefly responsible for this phenomenon.  After the Supreme
Court's decision, agencies were allowed to discontinue background checks 
and thus no longer collected and submitted data to FIST.  At the same time, 
the continuing effort required to report data decreased interest in participation 
among some agencies.  FIST was able to compensate for the decline in
participation by the addition of new CLEOs.     

Respondents contacted by telephone may be subject to nonsampling
error in much the same manner as with respondents in the ongoing
survey.  Error may occur from nonresponse, differential handling
of data, differences in interpretation of questions, and
activities causing delay in paperwork.  In addition, as in the
ongoing survey, the process of a researcher receiving and
storing data can introduce nonsampling error.  Efforts were made
to minimize the potential for error.  CLEOs providing data by
telephone were asked to review and revise their reports, and
various quality checks were performed in receiving and
processing the data.

Data collection procedures  

The Regional Justice Information Service (REJIS), through a
cooperative agreement with BJS under the Firearm Inquiry
Statistics (FIST) program, collected the data.  

The CLEOs supplied data on either paper or diskette.  Several
different forms were provided to meet the varying office
procedures of the CLEOs.  In addition REJIS wrote and provided
special software that was distributed free of charge to
requesting CLEOs.  This software was designed to simplify the
record tabulating functions of the CLEO.  It also helped to
reduce the burden of keeping the statistical data since one of
the capabilities of the software was to automatically report the
data needed for the study.  In all cases the data that the CLEO
sent to REJIS contained only statistical information and would
not allow the identification of an individual.

Respondents contacted during the supplemental survey supplied
data either directly by telephone to the caller or on a special
tally sheet prepared by FIST staff and returned to REJIS by
facsimile. 

Determining populations

For local CLEOs, a State would choose to have county officials
(usually the sheriff) as the CLEOs or municipal officials
(police departments) or a combination of the two.  To evaluate
properly the application and rejection rates for purchasing
handguns within a given area, the appropriate CLEO population
was needed and was determined as follows:  

* The stratification classification of the county was based on
the size of the largest city within the county.  

* If cities within a participating county CLEO were acting as
their own CLEOs, their populations were subtracted from the
county population.

* If a municipal CLEO was discovered to be providing services for 
other selected municipalities, then populations for those municipalities 
were added to the populations of the city having the CLEO.  

* Those CLEOs selected to participate in the study but found to
be relying on other jurisdictions to conduct back-ground checks were
replaced by those other jurisdictions (for example, a town being
replaced by a county).
