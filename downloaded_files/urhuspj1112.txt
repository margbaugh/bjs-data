Special Report

Use of Restrictive Housing in U.S. Prisons and Jails, 2011–12

Allen J. Beck, Ph.D., BJS Statistician

On an average day in 2011–12, up to 4.4% of state and federal 
inmates and 2.7% of jail inmates were held in administrative 
segregation or solitary confinement. Nearly 20% of prison inmates 
and 18% of jail inmates had spent time in restrictive housing, 
including disciplinary or administrative segregation or solitary 
confinement, in the past 12 months or since coming to their current 
facility, if shorter.  Approximately 10% of all prison inmates 
and 5% of jail inmates had spent 30 days or longer in restrictive 
housing.

This report is based on data from the National Inmate Survey 
(NIS), 2011–12, conducted in 233 state and federal prisons and 357 
local jails, with a sample of 91,177 adult inmates nationwide. 
The NIS is part of the National Prison Rape Statistics Program, 
which collects reports of sexual victimization from administrative 
records and from allegations of sexual victimization directly from 
victims through surveys of inmates in prisons and jails. The inmate 
surveys contain a wide range of data beyond measures of sexual 
victimization, including items useful for describing inmates held 
in state and federal prisons or local jails and their confinement 
experiences. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) completed 
the third NIS between February 2011 and May 2012.

Highlights
***************

* Younger inmates, inmates without a high school diploma, and 
lesbian, gay, and bisexual inmates were more likely to have spent 
time in restrictive housing than older inmates, inmates with a 
high school diploma or more, and heterosexual inmates (figure 1).

* Inmates held for a violent offense other than a sex offense 
and inmates with extensive arrest histories or prior incarcerations
 were more likely to have spent time in restrictive housing 
than inmates held for other offenses and inmates with no prior 
arrests or incarcerations.

* Use of restrictive housing was linked to inmate mental health problems: 
29% of prison inmates and 22% of jail inmates with current symptoms 
of serious psychological distress had spent time in restrictive 
housing units in the past 12 months.

* More than three-quarters of inmates in prisons and jails who had been 
written up for assaulting other inmates or staff spent time in restrictive 
housing in the past 12 months.

* Among inmates who had spent 30 or more days in restrictive housing in the 
past 12 months or since coming to the facility, 54% of those in prison and 
68% of those in jail had been in a fight or had been written up for 
assaulting other inmates or staff. 

* Prison and jail facilities varied widely in their rates of use of 
restrictive housing. In 17% of prisons and 9% of jails, fewer than 5% of 
inmates spent time in restrictive housing. In comparison, in 38% of prisons 
and 24% of jails at least 25% of the inmates had spent such time.

* Prisons with higher rates of restrictive housing had higher levels of 
facility disorder; lower levels of inmate trust and confidence in staff; 
higher concentrations of violent inmates (other than sex offenders) and 
inmates with longer criminal histories; higher percentages of inmates with 
mental health problems; and higher percentages of lesbian, gay, and bisexual 
inmates.

Measuring the use of restrictive housing
*****************************************

The National Inmate Survey (NIS) is part of the National Prison Rape 
Statistics Program, which collects reports of sexual victimization from 
administrative records and from allegations of sexual victimization directly 
from victims through surveys of inmates in prisons and jails. The Bureau of 
Justice Statistics (BJS) has implemented this program to meet the 
requirements of the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (P.L. 108-79). 
However, the inmate surveys contain a wide range of data beyond measures of 
sexual victimization, including items useful for describing inmates held in 
state and federal prisons and local jails and their confinement experiences. 
This report examines data reported by inmates held in adult facilities on 
their current housing and any time spent in disciplinary or administrative 
segregation or solitary confinement in the past 12 months or since coming to 
the facility, if shorter.

The use of restrictive housing is difficult to measure. Absent uniform 
definitions and information systems that classify inmates in comparable 
categories, estimates based on data reported by correctional officials are 
subject to variation and uncertainty, depending on the data collection. 
Nevertheless, almost every correctional system, at the federal, state, or 
local level, places inmates in some form of restrictive housing to separate 
some inmates from the general institutional population.

Inmates may be held in restrictive housing for their protection or for the 
safety of other inmates. They may be held while awaiting classification or 
reclassification, while awaiting transfer to another facility or unit within 
a facility, or while awaiting a hearing or as a sanction for violating a 
facility rule. Inmates may also be separated from the general population to 
provide for their special needs (e.g., medical or mental health) or to ensure 
the safety, security, and orderly operation of the facility. Whether it is 
disciplinary segregation, administrative segregation (largely nonpunitive in 
nature), or solitary confinement (involving isolation and relatively little 
out-of-cell time), restrictive housing typically involves limited interaction 
with other inmates, limited programming opportunities, and reduced 
privileges. However, the use of restrictive housing varies widely in terms of 
duration and conditions of confinement.

The NIS surveys, which involve separate samples of prisons and jails, collect 
information on the use of restrictive housing from the perspective of the 
inmates. Data from the most recent National Inmate Survey (NIS-3), conducted 
between February 2011 and May 2012, provide measures of prevalence beyond the 
housing status of inmates on a single day, including whether the inmates had 
spent any time in restrictive housing in the past 12 months or since coming 
to the facility, if shorter, and the total amount of time they had spent. The 
surveys of prison and jail inmates provide estimates of time in restrictive 
housing by inmate demographic characteristics, criminal justice status and 
history, current and past mental health status, and facility misconduct in 
the past 12 months. When aggregated at the facility level, the NIS-3 data 
also provide information on a representative sample of prison and jail 
facilities, including detail on variation among facilities in the use of 
restrictive housing by selected facility characteristics.

The NIS-3 survey, conducted by RTI International (Research Triangle Park, 
NC), was administered to 91,177 inmates age 18 or older, including 38,251 
inmates in 233 state and federal prisons and 52,926 inmates in 357 jails. The 
results are nationally representative of prison and jail inmates at the time 
of the survey and representative at the facility level for each sampled 
facility. (See Methodology for detailed description of the sampling and 
estimation.)

Individual-level rates
************************

--------------------------------------------------
On an average day in 2011–12, up to 4.4% 
of state and federal prisoners and 2.7% 
of jail inmates were held in administrative 
segregation or solitary confinement
--------------------------------------------------

Based on inmate self-reports, an estimated 1.9% of state and federal 
prisoners and 2.2% of local jail inmates said they were housed in 
administrative segregation or solitary confinement at the time of the survey 
(table 1). However, the actual percentages held in restrictive housing may be 
higher.

An estimated 2.5% of prison inmates and 0.5% of jail inmates completed a 
paper survey that did not inquire about their housing status. Many, but not 
all, of these inmates may have been in administrative or disciplinary 
segregation. Some were inmates whom staff were reluctant to bring to the 
interview room because they were considered too violent, and some were 
inmates whom staff determined should not have access to a computer.

In addition, some inmates were unavailable for any contact by survey staff. 
Among the inmates selected for the survey, approximately 0.19% of prison 
inmates and 0.23% of jail inmates were unavailable because they were in 
segregation; 0.29% of prison inmates and 0.77% of jail inmates were 
considered too violent even for survey staff to contact for a paper 
interview; and 0.49% of prison inmates and 0.73% of jail inmates were 
considered to be mentally incompetent by facility or survey staff (not 
shown). Combined, these excluded inmates totaled approximately 1.0% of all 
selected prisoners and 1.7% of all jail inmates. While the survey results 
were adjusted for nonresponse through a series of weighting adjustments 
within each selected facility and nationwide, the adjustments were not linked 
specifically to the reasons for nonresponse. However, the impact on the 
national estimates was likely to be small because the excluded inmates 
represented about the same percentages among all selected inmates as found in 
the final survey estimates. The weighting adjustments were sufficient to 
provide an overall estimate without including these inmates who were not 
contacted by survey staff.

The national estimates of percentage held in restrictive housing could be as 
high as 4.4% of prison inmates and 2.7% of jail inmates if most of the 
inmates completing a paper form were assumed to have been in some form of 
restrictive housing and a further adjustment for nonresponse was made to 
account for inmates who were held in segregation and unavailable to the 
survey staff.

--------------------------------------------------
Nearly 20% of prison inmates and 18% of jail 
inmates had spent time in restrictive housing 
in the past 12 months or since coming to the 
facility, if shorter
--------------------------------------------------

An estimated 18% of prison inmates and 17% of jail inmates said they 
had spent time in disciplinary or administrative segregation or solitary 
confinement in the past 12 months or since coming to the facility, if 
shorter. If combined with respondents for whom time in restrictive housing 
was unknown, the actual percentages may be as high as 20% among prison 
inmates and 18% of jail inmates.

This experience was limited to the inmates’ current facility but 
increased steadily with time served. Overall, 49% of prison inmates 
and 92% of jail inmates had been in the facility for less than a year 
(not shown). During the 12 months prior to the survey, state and 
federal prisoners had been in the facility for an average of 8.6 
months and jail inmates for an average of 3.5 months (table 2). 

Among inmates who had been admitted to the facility in the past month, 
8% of both prison and jail inmates had spent some time in restrictive 
housing. Among inmates who had been in the facility for 2 to 3 months, 
12% of prisoners and 14% of jail inmates had spent time in restrictive 
housing. Among those in the facility for 6 to 8 months, 20% of prisoners 
and 27% of jail inmates had spent time in restrictive housing. Among 
inmates who had served 12 months or more, 20% of prisoners and 35% of 
jail inmates had been in restrictive housing at some point.

The total time inmates had spent in restrictive housing varied among 
prison and jail inmates. Approximately 10% of all prison inmates and 
5% of jail inmates said they had spent 30 days or longer in restrictive 
housing. In comparison, about 3% of prisoners and 6% of jail inmates 
had spent less than a week.

--------------------------------------------------
Time in restrictive housing varied among 
inmate demographic groups
--------------------------------------------------

Younger inmates were significantly more likely than older inmates 
to report having spent time in restrictive housing. Among inmates 
ages 18 to 19, 31% of those in prison and 25% of those in jail had 
spent some time in restrictive housing (table 3). Among inmates ages 
20 to 24, 28% of those in prison and 23% of those in jail had been 
in restrictive housing at some time during the past year. 
The percentages who reported time in restrictive housing were 
lower among persons age 30 or older in prison (20% or below) and 
among persons age 25 or older in jails (19% or below).

Inmates without a high school diploma were more likely than high school 
graduates to have spent time in restrictive housing. Among prison inmates, 
20% of those with less than a high school education had spent time in 
restrictive housing, compared to 15% of those who completed high school. 
Similarly, among jail inmates, 19% of those with less than high school 
education had spent time in restrictive housing, compared to 15% of those 
who had a high school diploma or more.

In prisons, black inmates (21%) were somewhat more likely than white inmates 
(16%) to have spent time in restrictive housing; however, in jail they were 
equally likely to have spent such time (17% each). Inmates of other races 
(including American Indians and Alaska Natives; Asians, Native Hawaiians, and 
other Pacific Islanders; and those reporting two or more races) were more 
likely than white inmates to have spent time in restrictive housing (20% in 
prison and 22% in jail). Hispanic inmates (16% in prison and jail) were as 
likely as white inmates in prison and white and black inmates in jail to 
report having spent time in restrictive housing.

Lesbian, gay, and bisexual inmates (28% in prison and 22% in jail) were more 
likely than heterosexual inmates (18% in prison and 17% in jail) to have 
spent some time in restrictive housing.

--------------------------------------------------
Time in restrictive housing units linked 
to current offense and past criminal 
justice contacts
--------------------------------------------------

* Inmates held for a violent offense other than a sex offense (25% in prison 
and 28% in jail) were significantly more likely than inmates held for other 
offenses to have spent time in restrictive housing (table 4).

* Inmates with extensive criminal histories were also more likely than 
inmates with shorter criminal histories to have spent time in restrictive 
housing. Among inmates with 11 or more prior arrests, 24% of those in prison 
and 22% of those in jail had been in restrictive housing. In comparison, 
about 13% of inmates in prisons and jails who had been arrested once had been 
in restrictive housing.

* Inmates who had a prior incarceration (20% of prison inmates and 19% of 
jail inmates) were more likely than other inmates (about 13% for both) to 
have been in restrictive housing in the past 12 months.

* Among inmates who had been in prison or jail before, the percentage 
reporting time in restrictive housing increased with amount of time they had 
served in the past. Among those who had served 5 or more years on a prior 
incarceration, 21% of prisoners and 22% of jail inmates had been in 
restrictive housing at some time in the past 12 months.

--------------------------------------------------
Use of restrictive housing linked to inmate 
mental health problems
--------------------------------------------------

The inmate surveys collected data on the past mental health problems of 
inmates. Inmates were asked whether they had ever been told by a mental 
health professional that they had a mental health disorder, or if because of 
a mental health problem they had stayed overnight in a hospital or other 
facility, used prescription medicine, or received counseling or treatment 
from a trained professional. (See Methodology for more detail.)

On every measure of past mental health problems, inmates who reported a 
problem were also more likely than other inmates to report that they had 
spent time in restrictive housing in the past 12 months or since coming to 
the facility, if shorter (table 5). Time in restrictive housing was reported 
by--

* 26% of prison inmates and 23% of jail inmates who had been told they had a 
mental health disorder

* 31% of prison inmates and 25% of jail inmates who had stayed overnight in a 
hospital or other facility during the 12 months prior to their admission for 
mental health problems

* 26% of prison inmates and 23% of jail inmates who at the time of the 
current offense were taking prescription medicine for mental health problems

* 26% of prison inmates and 23% of jail inmates who had ever received 
counseling or therapy from a trained professional—such as a psychiatrist, 
psychologist, social worker, or nurse—for mental health problems.

Lower percentages of inmates without a mental health problem had spent time 
in restrictive housing. Overall, about 14% of prison inmates and 12% of jail 
inmates who reported no past mental health problems had spent time in 
restrictive housing.

--------------------------------------------------
A high percentage of inmates with current symptoms 
of serious psychological distress had spent time 
in restrictive housing units
--------------------------------------------------

The surveys included the K6 screening scale to determine whether inmates had 
a current mental health problem. The K6 was previously developed by Kessler 
and others for estimating the prevalence of mental illness in non-
institutional settings as a tool to identify cases of psychiatric 
disorder***Footnote 3 Kessler, R.C., Green, J.G., Gruber, M.J., Sampson, 
N.A., Bromet, E., Cuitan, M., Furukawa, ... Zaslavsky, A.M. (2010). Screening 
for serious mental illness in the general population with the K6 screening 
scale: results from WHO World Mental Health (WHM) survey initiative. 
International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research, 19(1), 4–22***. It 
has been used widely in epidemiological surveys in the United States and 
internationally, including with prison populations***Footnote 2 Schneider, 
K., Richters, J., Butler, T., Yap, L., Richards, A., Grant, L., et al. 
(2011). Psychological distress and experience of sexual and physical assault 
among Australian prisoners. Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health, 21(5), 333-
349***.

Since 2008, the K6 scale has been used in federal epidemiological studies to 
measure symptoms of serious psychological distress (SPD). Although the K6 has 
been demonstrated to be a good predictor of serious mental illness in prior 
studies, a technical advisory group, convened by the Center for Mental Health 
Services at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA), recommended that it should be supplemented with questions on 
functional impairment to improve statistical prediction and validity. (See 
Methodology for detail on specific items and scoring.)

Consistent with other measures of mental health or emotional problems, the K6 
revealed that prison and jail inmates identified with SPD were more likely 
than inmates with no mental health symptoms to have spent time in restrictive 
housing. Among inmates with symptoms of psychological distress, 29% of those 
in prison and 22% of those in jail had spent time in restrictive housing in 
the past 12 months or since coming to the facility. In comparison, among 
inmates with no symptoms of mental health problems, approximately 15% of 
those in both prisons and jails had been in restrictive housing.

While these differences may reflect a variety of factors related to the use 
of segregation by correctional authorities, including sanctions imposed for 
violations of facility rules, they may also reflect the need to provide 
protective custody (for nonpunitive reasons) and placement in administrative 
segregation (while assessing treatment needs and appropriate classification). 
Moreover, time in restrictive housing—especially longer periods of time—may 
trigger symptoms of SPD.

Data also showed that inmates who had not spent any time in restrictive 
housing had lower levels of SPD than other inmates. Among prison inmates who 
had not spent any time in restrictive housing, 13% were identified with SPD.
Among jail inmates without any time in restrictive housing, 25% were 
identified with SPD (table 6).

Among both prison and jail inmates, rates of SPD were significantly higher 
among those who had spent time in restrictive housing; however, the rates did 
not increase with the length of time they had been in such housing. An 
estimated 24% of prison inmates and 35% of jail inmates who had spent 30 days 
or longer in restrictive housing had SPD. Nearly identical rates of SPD were 
reported among inmates who had been in restrictive housing for only a day 
(22% of prison inmates and 35% of jail inmates). Overall, the data revealed 
no relationship between the length of time in restrictive housing and rates 
of SPD.

--------------------------------------------------
More than three-quarters of inmates written up 
for assaulting other inmates or staff had spent 
time in restrictive housing
--------------------------------------------------

The prison and jail surveys included five items that measure the prevalence 
of inmate misconduct during the past 12 months or since coming to the 
facility, if shorter. Inmates were asked whether (1) they had been in a fight 
with another inmate, (2) they had been written up for assaulting the inmate, 
(3) they had been in a fight with staff, (4) they had been written up for 
physically assaulting a staff member, and (5) they had been written up for 
verbally assaulting a staff member. (See Methodology for detail.)

Time in restrictive housing was reported by--

* 49% of prison inmates and 43% of jail inmates who had been in a fight with 
another inmate

* 56% of prison inmates and 52% of jail inmates who had been in a fight with 
staff

* at least three-quarters of those who had been written up for fighting with 
other inmates (77% in prison and 79% in jail) or verbally assaulting staff 
(74% in prison and 80% in jail)

* more than 80% of both prison and jail inmates who had been written up for 
physically assaulting a correctional officer or other facility staff (table 
7).
Approximately 10% to 11% of inmates who had no mention of fighting or being 
written up for assaulting other inmates or staff had spent some time in 
restrictive housing.

Among inmates serving the longest amount of time in restrictive housing 
(i.e., 30 or more days in the past 12 months or since coming to the facility, 
if shorter), 54% of those in prison and 68% of those in jail had been in a 
fight or had been written up for assaulting other inmates or staff (not 
shown).

---------------------------
Facility-level rates
---------------------------

When aggregated at the facility level, the inmate self-reports provide 
reliable facility-level estimates of the use of restrictive housing. Unlike 
most BJS surveys, the NIS-3 was designed to provide facility-level estimates 
with sufficient precision to accurately describe facilities. Within each 
facility, the number of inmates sampled was based on criteria related to the 
expected prevalence rate of sexual victimization (4% in prisons and 3% in 
jails), with a desired level of precision (a standard error of 1.75% in 
prisons and 1.40% in jails) and an expected response rate (70% in prisons and 
65% in jails). Due to the size of the samples within each facility, the NIS 
can provide estimates for other facility-level characteristics. See Sexual 
Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2011–12 (NCJ 241399, 
BJS web, May 2013.)

The data reveal significant variation in the use of restrictive housing 
across prison and jail facilities. On average, prisons and jails used 
restrictive housing at similar levels: 17% of inmates in the average prison 
and 17% in the average jail had spent time in restrictive housing in the past 
12 months or since coming to the facility (table 8). However, the 
distributions of facility-level rates were quite different:

* Fewer than 1% of their inmates had spent time in restrictive housing in 7% 
of the jails and less than 1% of prisons.

* 25% or more of the inmates had been in restrictive housing in 38% of the 
nation’s prisons, compared 24% of jails.

Prisons had higher rates than jails of inmates held in restrictive housing 
for 30 days or more. Approximately 27% of jails had held less than 1% of 
their inmates for 30 days or more, compared to 13% of prisons. At least 30% 
of prisons had held 10% or more of their inmates in restrictive housing for 
30 days or more, compared to 17% of jails.

--------------------------------------------------
Use of restrictive housing associated with 
indicators of facility disorder
--------------------------------------------------

In the absence of administrative data on assaults, gang activity, seizures of 
weapons, or other security incidents, the inmate self-report data may also be 
used to provide independent measures for each facility. The prison and jail 
surveys asked inmates to report on--

* fighting within their facility and whether they had been in a fight with 
other inmates or staff

* whether they worried about being assaulted by other inmates

* whether they had seen other inmates with weapons

* if there was lots of gang activity in the facility

* if some of their possessions had been taken by other inmates. 

When aggregated at the facility level, the inmate responses provided a series 
of indicators of facility disorder. (See Methodology for more detail.)

The data revealed a clear relationship between the use of restrictive housing 
in facilities and these indicators of facility disorder. On every measure, 
prison facilities with higher percentages of inmates reporting disorder had 
higher rates of inmates held in restrictive housing in the past 12 months 
(table 9). In prisons, the correlation with the use of restrictive housing 
was the highest for the percentage of inmates reporting having been in fights 
with other inmates (r=0.65) and in fights with staff (r=0.59).

In prisons, the same pattern was found for the percentage of inmates held in 
restrictive housing for 30 days or more. Facilities in which a high 
percentage of inmates reported having been in fights with staff (r=0.61) or 
other inmates (r=0.53) also had high rates of using long-term segregation.

Among jails, five of the seven measures of facility disorder were associated 
with greater use of restrictive housing. Although the correlations in jails 
were generally lower than those observed in prisons, the percentage of 
inmates who had been in restrictive housing at some time in the past 12 
months or since coming to the facility remained strongly related to the 
percentage who had been in fights with other inmates (r=0.37) and staff 
(r=0.37). The same relationships were found for the percentage of inmates who 
had spent 30 days or more in restrictive housing.

--------------------------------------------------
Facility-level rates of restrictive housing 
associated with characteristics of inmates housed
--------------------------------------------------

Selected facility-level measures were calculated based on inmate-level 
characteristics associated with reports of time in restrictive housing. 
Facilities’ use of restrictive housing varied in the types of inmates that 
they held. These measures of facility composition included the percentage of 
inmates--

* with serious psychological distress

* with a past mental health problem

* held for violent crimes other than sex offenses

* with 11 or more prior arrests

* with a prior incarceration

* with less than a high school diploma

* who were lesbian, gay, or bisexual

* who were ages 18 to 24. (See Methodology for more detail.)

Among prisons, five of the eight measures of facility composition were 
associated with greater use of restrictive housing (table 10). The 
correlation with use of restrictive housing was the highest for the 
percentage of inmates with current symptoms of SPD (r=0.65) or past mental 
health problems (r=0.48) and the percentage held for violent offenses other 
than sex offenses (r=0.50). While facilities with an increasing percentage of 
inmates with 11 or more prior arrests also had higher rates of restrictive 
housing, the association was not as strong (r=0.20). The data also revealed a 
clear link between the percentage of inmates who were lesbian, gay, or 
bisexual and the greater use of restrictive housing (r=0.33).

The same patterns were found for the percentage of inmates held in 
restrictive housing for 30 days or more, although the correlations were 
somewhat weaker. The percentage of inmates held with symptoms of SPD (r=0.51) 
and the percentage held for violent crimes (excluding sex offenders) (r=0.46) 
were the most strongly correlated with the percentage of inmates who spent 30 
days or more in restrictive housing.

The composition of inmates held in local jail facilities was largely 
unrelated to the use of restrictive housing. Among jails, only two of the 
eight measures of facility composition were positively associated with the 
greater use of restrictive housing.

The percentage of inmates with past mental health problems had the strongest 
correlation (r=0.42) with the percentage of inmates who had spent any time in 
restrictive housing. One of the composition measures for jail facilities was 
associated with the percentage of inmates who had spent 30 days or more in 
restrictive housing. In constrast, the percentage of inmates with 11 or more 
prior arrests was negatively correlated with the rate of long-term 
restrictive housing (r=-0.19).

--------------------------------------------------
Lack of inmate trust and confidence in staff 
linked to greater use of restrictive housing
--------------------------------------------------

The prison and jail surveys also included items that asked inmates to 
characterize staff, including whether the staff at the facility--

* are generally fair

* do their best to make this facility safe and secure

* try to meet the needs of the inmates

* break up fights quickly

* use physical force only when necessary

* let inmates know what is expected of them

* generally treat inmates with respect

* follow facility rules when handling inmate complaints and grievances

* often write up inmates who don’t deserve it.

As with the measure of facility disorder and inmate composition, the inmate 
self-report data may be used to provide an independent measure of the overall 
level of trust and confidence that inmates have with the staff in each 
facility. (See Methodology for more detail.)

The responses to these nine items were combined at the inmate level and then 
weighted to provide a summary score for each facility. To account for item 
nonresponse, inmate-level scores were calculated only if an inmate had 
responded to two or more items. Their score reflected the percentage of items 
for which the inmate had provided a negative response (“disagree” for all 
items except the last, and “agree” that staff “often write up inmates who 
don’t deserve it”). In each facility, the inmate responses were then averaged 
(weighted by the inmate weight adjusted for nonresponse) to provide an 
overall facility-level score. The facility-level scores in prisons ranged 
from 5% to 72% (with a weighted mean of 46%), and in jails from 8% to 73% 
(with a weighted mean of 37%). The higher the percentage, the more negative 
the inmates’ assessments of the facility staff.

There was a clear relationship between the use of restrictive housing and 
this summary indicator of facility climate. Prison facilities with higher 
percentages of inmates reporting negative assessments of staff had higher 
percentages of inmates held in restrictive housing (r=0.38) and higher 
percentages of inmates being held for 30 days or more (r=0.33) (table 11). 
Among jail facilities, the association with  negative perceptions of staff 
fairness and trust was limited to the percentage of inmates who had spent 30 
days or more in restrictive housing (r=0.25).

Other indicators of a facility’s climate included measures related to 
crowding and sufficient staff at the facility. Inmates were asked about 
crowding in their housing unit and in areas outside of their housing unit 
(such as in the dining hall, classrooms, gym, or work areas). Inmates who 
reported “very crowded” were weighted and summed to provide a measure of 
crowding. In addition, inmates were asked if the facility had enough staff to 
provide for the safety and security of inmates. Again, when their responses 
were aggregated at the facility level, they provided an indicator of facility 
climate. (See Methodology for more detail.)

The use of restrictive housing was unrelated to prison crowding. Neither 
measure was associated with the percentage of inmates held in restrictive 
housing. In jail facilities, crowding of areas outside of the housing units 
was correlated with greater use of restrictive housing (r=0.50) but not with 
the length of time in such housing (r=0.17, which was not statistically 
significant).

As with measures of facility disorder, lack of sufficient staff was 
associated with a facility’s use of restrictive housing. Among prison 
facilities, the higher the percentage of inmates reporting that the facility 
did not have enough staff to provide for the safety and security of inmates, 
the higher the percentage of inmates who reported time in restrictive housing 
(r=0.31) and the percentage who spent 30 days or more in such housing 
(r=0.20). In jail facilities, only the percentage of inmates reporting a lack 
of staff to provide for safety and security was associated with the 
percentage who spent 30 days or more in restrictive housing (r=.25).

A consistent pattern was observed at the facility-level. Facilities with 
higher rates of restrictive housing had higher levels of facility disorder; 
lower levels of inmate trust and confidence; higher concentrations of violent 
inmates and inmates with longer criminal histories; higher percentages of 
inmates with mental health problems; and higher percentages of vulnerable 
populations (i.e., lesbian, gay, and bisexual inmates, and younger inmates)

Methodology
***************

-----------------------------------
National Inmate Survey-3 (NIS-3)
-----------------------------------

The National Inmate Survey is part of the National Prison Rape Statistics 
Program, which collects reports of sexual victimization from administrative 
records and from allegations of sexual victimization directly from victims 
through surveys of inmates in prisons and jails. BJS has implemented this 
program to meet the requirements of the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 
(P.L. 108-79). The inmate surveys contain a wide range of data beyond 
measures of sexual victimization, including items useful for describing 
inmates held in the state and federal prisons and local jails and their 
confinement experiences. This report examines data reported by inmates held 
in adult facilities on their current and past time spent in disciplinary or 
administrative segregation or solitary confinement.

BJS completed the third National Inmate Survey (NIS-3) between February 2011 
and May 2012. The survey, conducted by RTI International (Research Triangle 
Park, NC), was administered to 91,177 inmates age 18 or older, including 
38,251 inmates in 233 state and federal prisons and 52,926 inmates in 357 
jails. The results are nationally representative of prison and jail inmates 
at the time of the survey.

The NIS-3 consisted of an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) in 
which inmates used a touch-screen to interact with a computer-assisted 
questionnaire and followed audio instructions delivered via headphones. Some 
inmates (733 prison inmates and 255 jail inmates) completed a short paper 
form instead of using the ACASI. Many of these inmates were housed in 
administrative or disciplinary segregation or were considered too violent to 
be interviewed, some were inmates who refused to come to the interview room, 
and some were inmates who staff were reluctant to bring to the interview room 
for other reasons.

For approximately the first two minutes, survey interviewers conducted a 
brief personal interview to obtain background information and the date of 
admission to the facility. For the remainder of the interview, respondents 
interacted with a computer-administered questionnaire using a touch-screen 
and synchronized audio instructions delivered via headphones. Respondents 
completed the ACASI portion of the interview in private, with the interviewer 
either leaving the room or moving away from the computer.

--------------------------------------------------
Selection of prisons and inmates within prisons
--------------------------------------------------

A sample of 241 state and federal prisons was drawn to produce a sample 
representing the 1,158 state and 194 federal adult confinement facilities 
identified in the 2005 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional 
Facilities, which was supplemented with updated information from websites 
maintained by each state department of corrections (DOC) and the federal 
Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Of the 241 selected prison facilities, seven had 
closed prior to the start of data collection, and one had transitioned from 
holding males to females during the data collection period and was considered 
a closed facility, based on the original sampling criteria. All of the other 
selected prison facilities participated fully in the NIS-3.
The NIS-3 was restricted to confinement facilities—institutions in which 
fewer than 50% of inmates were regularly permitted to leave, unaccompanied by 
staff, for work, study, or treatment. Such facilities included prisons, 
penitentiaries, prison hospitals, prison farms, boot camps, and centers for 
reception, classification, or alcohol and drug treatment. The NIS-3 excluded 
community-based facilities, such as halfway houses, group homes, and work 
release centers.

A roster of inmates was obtained just prior to the start of data collection 
at each facility. Inmates who were age 15 or younger and inmates who were 
released prior to data collection were deleted from the roster. Inmates who 
were ages 16 to 17 were sampled separately and have been excluded from this 
report.

Each eligible adult inmate was assigned a random number and sorted in 
ascending order. Inmates were selected from the list up to the expected 
number of inmates determined by the sampling criteria that reflected the 
projected response rate (70%), a desired level of precision, and size of the 
facility. A total of 74,655 adult prison inmates were selected. After 
selection, 2,233 ineligible inmates were excluded. Overall, 60% of the 
selected eligible prison inmates participated in the survey. Approximately 
90% of the participating prison inmates (38,251 adults) completed the sexual 
assault survey from which the data on restrictive housing were drawn.

--------------------------------------------------
Selection of jail facilities and jail inmates
--------------------------------------------------

A sample of 393 jails was drawn to represent the 2,957 jail facilities 
identified in the 2005 Census of Jail Inmates, which was supplemented with 
information obtained from inmate surveys (NIS-1 and NIS-2) conducted in 2007 
and 2008–09. The 2005 census was a complete enumeration of all jail 
jurisdictions, including all publicly operated and privately operated 
facilities under contract to jail authorities. The NIS-3 was limited to jails 
that held six or more inmates on June 30, 2005. These jails held an estimated 
720,171 inmates age 18 or older on June 30, 2011.

Jail facilities were sequentially sampled with probabilities of selection 
proportionate to size (as measured by the number of inmates held on June 30, 
2005). Of the 393 selected jails in the NIS-3, 20 facilities refused to 
participate, 2 were excused due to construction or lack of space at the 
facility, and 14 were determined to be ineligible. All of the other selected 
jail facilities participated fully in the NIS-3.

A roster of inmates was obtained just prior to the start of data collection 
at each facility. Inmates who were age 15 or younger and inmates who had not 
been arraigned were removed from the roster. Inmates who were ages 16 to 17 
(juveniles) were sampled separately and have been excluded from this report.

Each eligible adult inmate was assigned a random number and sorted in 
ascending order. Inmates were selected from the list up to the expected 
number of inmates determined by the sampling criteria.

Due to the dynamic nature of jail populations, a second roster of inmates was 
obtained on the first day of data collection. Eligible adult inmates who 
appeared on the second roster but who had not appeared on the initial roster 
were identified. These inmates had been arraigned since the initial roster 
was created or were newly admitted to the facility and arraigned. A random 
sample of these new inmates was chosen using the same probability of 
selection used to sample from the first roster.

A total of 112,594 jail inmates were selected. After selection, 11,342 
ineligible inmates were excluded: 9,479 were released or transferred to 
another facility before interviewing began, 1,036 were mentally or physically 
unable to be interviewed, 25 were age 15 or younger or their age could not be 
obtained during the interview process, 296 were selected in error (i.e., an 
inmate was incorrectly listed on the facility roster), and 484 were on 
unsupervised work release or only served time on weekends.

Of all selected inmates, 22% refused to participate in the survey, 1.1% were 
not available to be interviewed (e.g., in court, in medical segregation, 
determined by the facility to be too violent to be interviewed, or restricted 
from participation by another legal jurisdiction), and 8% were not 
interviewed due to survey logistics (e.g., language barriers, releases, and 
transfers to another facility after interviewing began). Overall, 61% of the 
selected eligible jail inmates participated in the survey. Approximately 90% 
of the participating jail inmates (52,926 adults) completed the sexual 
assault survey from which the data on restrictive housing were drawn.

For a more detailed description of the NIS-3 sample, see Sexual Victimization 
in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2011–12 (NCJ 241399, BJS web, May 
2013).

----------------------------------------
Weighting and nonresponse adjustments
----------------------------------------

Responses from interviewed inmates were weighted to provide facility- and 
national-level estimates. Each interviewed inmate was assigned an initial 
weight corresponding to the inverse of the probability of selection within 
each sampled facility. A series of adjustment factors was applied to the 
initial weight to minimize potential bias due to nonresponse and to provide 
national estimates.

A final ratio adjustment to each inmate weight was made to provide national-
level estimates for the total number of inmates age 18 or older who were held 
in prisons at yearend 2011 or in jails at midyear 2011. These estimates for 
state prisons were 1,154,600 adult males and 83,400 adult females; for 
federal prisons, 190,600 adult males and 13,200 adult females; and for jails 
(with an average daily populations of six or more inmates), 628,620 adult 
males and 91,551 adult females.

--------------------------------------------------
Standard errors and tests of significance
--------------------------------------------------

As with any survey, the NIS estimates are subject to error because they are 
based on a sample rather than a complete enumeration. A common way to express 
this sampling variability is to construct a 95%-confidence interval around 
each survey estimate. Typically, multiplying the standard error by 1.96 and 
then adding or subtracting the result from the estimate produces the 
confidence interval. This interval expresses the range of values that could 
result among 95% of the different samples that could be drawn.

The standard errors in appendix tables 1 through 8 have been used to compare 
estimates of the prevalence of restrictive housing among selected groups of 
inmates that have been defined by demographic subgroup, criminal justice 
status and history, mental health status, and indicators of inmate 
misconduct. To facilitate the analysis, differences in the estimates of 
percentage of inmates reporting any time in restrictive housing have been 
tested and notated for significance at the 95%-confidence level.

For example, the difference in the percentage who reported time in 
restrictive housing among white prison inmates (16.0%), compared to black 
prison inmates (20.8%), was statistically significant at the 95% level of 
confidence (table 3 and appendix table 3). In all tables providing detailed 
comparisons, statistically significant differences at the 95% level of 
confidence or greater have been designated with two asterisks (**).

The standard errors in appendix tables 9 through 11 have been provided to 
test the significance of the linear association (based on the Pearson 
product-moment coefficient) between selected facility characteristics and the 
percentage of inmates who experienced time in restrictive housing. By 
weighting by the inverse of the probability of selection of each facility, 
the facility-level estimates and standard errors take into account the 
sampling variability at the first stage in the NIS-3 sampling design. To 
construct a 95%-confidence interval around each correlation coefficient, the 
standard error may be multiplied by 1.96 and then added or subtracted from 
the estimated coefficient. The coefficient is considered statistically 
significant when the confidence interval excludes zero.

For example, the estimated correlation between the percentage of inmates in 
prisons who were frequently in fights and the percentage of inmates who 
reported having spent some time in restrictive housing was 0.52. Based on a 
standard error of 0.08, the 95%-confidence interval was 0.36 to 0.68, which 
was statistically significant (table 9 and appendix table 9). In all tables 
providing estimated correlations, statistically significant coefficients at 
the 95% level of confidence or greater have been designated with two 
asterisks (**).

--------------------------------------------------
Measures of time in restrictive housing
--------------------------------------------------

Prior to the start of the ACASI portion of the survey, interviewers conducted 
a brief personal interview using CAPI to obtain background information and 
the date of admission to the facility. The CAPI interview included an item on 
current housing:

A9. Which of the following best describes the housing unit where you spent 
last night?

1.	An open dorm

2.	A dorm with cubicles

3.	A unit with cells

4.	A unit with rooms

5.	An area not originally intended as housing, such as a gym, 
        classroom, or day room

6.	Administrative segregation or solitary confinement

7.	None of these

This item was not administered to inmates who received the paper form. 
Because many, but not all, of these inmates may have been held in restrictive 
housing, they were designated as “don’t know” and included in the estimates. 
Based on the final national weights, 2.5% of prison inmates and 0.5% of jail 
inmates were in this category.

The ACASI portion of the interview included two additional items on 
restrictive housing:

X9a. [FILL ITEM], have you spent any time in disciplinary or administrative 
segregation or solitary confinement?
1.	Yes

2.	No


X9b. [IF X9a=1] [FILL ITEM], how much total time have you spent in 
disciplinary or administrative segregation or solitary confinement?

1.	1 day or less

2.	More than 1 day but less than 7 days

3.	At least 7 days but less than 14 days

4.	At least 14 days but less than 30 days

5.	30 days or more

As with item A9, these items were also not administered to inmates who 
received the paper form. Because many, but not all, of these inmates may have 
been held in restrictive housing while in the facility, they were designated 
as “don’t know” and included in the estimates.

The FILL ITEM specified a reference period provided automatically by the 
computer based on how long the inmate had been held at the facility. For 
inmates who had been held in the prison or jail for less than 12 months, the 
reference period was “Since you arrived at this facility.” For inmates who 
had been in the facility for 12 months or more, the reference period was 
“During the past 12 months.”

--------------------------------------------------
Screening for serious psychological distress
--------------------------------------------------

The K6 consists of six questions that ask inmates to report how often during 
the past 30 days they had felt--

* nervous

* hopeless

* restless or fidgety

* so depressed that nothing could cheer them up

* everything was an effort

* worthless.

The response options were (1) all of the time, (2) most of the time, (3) some 
of the time, (4) a little of the time, and (5) none of the time. Following 
Kessler, the responses were coded from 4 to 0, with 4 assigned to “all of the 
time” and 0 assigned to “none of the time.”***Footnote 1 Kessler, R.C., 
Green, J.G., Gruber, M.J., Sampson, N.A., Bromet, E., Cuitan, M., Furukawa, 
... Zaslavsky, A.M. (2010). Screening for serious mental illness in the 
general population with the K6 screening scale: results from WHO World Mental 
Health (WHM) survey initiative. International Journal of Methods in 
Psychiatric Research, 19(1), 4–22.*** A summary scale combining the responses 
from all six items was then produced with a range of 0 to 24. The summary 
score was then reduced to three categories: 0 to 7 indicates no mental 
illness, 8 to 12 indicates an anxiety or mood disorder, and 13 or higher 
indicates serious psychological distress (SPD). See Sexual Victimization in 
Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2011–12 (NCJ 241399, BJS web, May 
2013) for a discussion of K6 scaling rules and past applications.

--------------------------------------------------
Measures of past mental health problems
--------------------------------------------------

The NIS-3 included four items to measure the prevalence of any problems with 
emotions, nerves, or mental health an inmate may have had in the past:

R24. Have you ever been told by a mental health professional, such as a 
psychiatrist or psychologist, that you had…

a.	Manic depression, a bipolar disorder, or mania?

b.	A depressive disorder?

c.	Schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder?

d.	Post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD?

e.	Another anxiety disorder, such as panic disorder or OCD?

f.	A personality disorder, such as antisocial or borderline personality?

g.	A mental or emotional condition other than those listed above?

R27. During the 12 months before you were admitted to [this facility/any 
facility to serve time on your current sentence], did you stay overnight or 
longer in any type of hospital or other facility to receive treatment or 
counseling for problems you were having with your emotions, nerves, or mental 
health?

R30. At the time of the offense for which you are currently [being 
held/serving time], were you taking prescription medicine for any problem you 
were having with your emotions, nerves, or mental health?

R33. Have you ever received counseling or therapy from a trained 
professional—such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or nurse--
for any problem you were having with your emotions, nerves, or mental health?

----------------------------------
Measures of inmate misconduct
----------------------------------

The NIS-3 included five items that measure the prevalence of inmate 
misconduct during the past 12 months or since coming to the facility, if 
shorter:

S17. In the past 12 months, have you been in a fight, assault, or incident in 
which another inmate tried to harm you?

S21. In the past 12 months, have you been in a fight, assault, or incident in 
which a correctional officer or other facility staff person tried to harm 
you?

X6a. In the past 12 months, have you been written up or charged with 
assaulting another inmate?

X7a. In the past 12 months, have you been written up or charged with 
physically assaulting a correctional officer or other facility staff?

X8a. In the past 12 months, have you been written up or charged with verbally 
assaulting a correctional officer or other facility staff?

----------------------------
Facility-level measures
----------------------------

In the absence of administrative data on characteristics of each facility, 
the inmate self-report data have been used to provide independent measures of 
facility disorder, composition, and climate of each facility. Because the NIS 
sample was designed to produce prevalence estimates of sexual victimization 
for each sampled facility, it also has the capacity to provide reliable 
estimates for other facility characteristics. Each facility sampled in the 
NIS is self-representing, and consequently the inmate responses, when 
weighted and summed at the facility-level, provide an overall indicator for 
each sampled facility.

Facility disorder--The NIS included seven items that provide a facility-level 
estimate of the percentage of inmates reporting some indication of facility 
disorder:

S13. In the past 12 months, how often are inmates at this facility hit, 
punched, or assaulted by other inmates? (Percentage reporting “frequently.”)

S14. In the past 12 months, how often do you worry about being hit, punched, 
or assaulted by other inmates in this facility? (Percentage reporting 
“frequently.”)

S15. In the past 12 months, how often have you seen other inmates with some 
type of weapon? (Percentage reporting “frequently” or “sometimes.”)

S16. In the past 12 months, how much gang activity has there been at this 
facility? (Percentage reporting “a lot.”)

S17. In the past 12 months, have you been in a fight, assault, or incident in 
which another inmate tried to harm you? (Percentage reporting “yes.”)

S21. In the past 12 months, have you been in a fight, assault, or incident in 
which a correctional officer or other facility staff person tried to harm 
you? (Percentage reporting “yes.”)

S25. In the past 12 months, have any of your personal possessions or 
belongings been taken by another inmate without your permission? (Percentage 
reporting “yes.”)

Facility composition--Facility composition measures are based on inmate 
subgroups that have a high percentage who reported time in restrictive 
housing. When weighted, summed, and converted to percentages at the facility-
level, the characteristics provide an overall indicator of the percentage of 
inmates in the facility with the characteristics. These measures include the 
percentage of inmates--

* with serious psychological distress

* with a past mental health problem
 
* held for a violent offense (excluding sex offenders)

* with 11 or more prior arrests

* with less than a high school diploma or equivalent

* who were lesbian, gay, bisexual, or other sexual orientation (other than 
heterosexual)

* who were ages 18 to 24.

Facility climate--Facility climate measures are based on three items related 
to crowding and sufficient staff and nine items related inmate perceptions of 
staff:

* S6. How crowded is it in your housing unit? (Percentage reporting “very 
crowded.”)

* S7. How crowded is it outside of the housing unit—for example, in the 
dining hall, classrooms, gym, or work areas? (Percentage reporting “very 
crowded.”)

* S29. In the past 12 months, do you think there has been enough staff at 
this facility to provide for the safety and security of inmates? (Percentage 
reporting “no.”)

* S9. Please indicate whether you agree or disagree with each of the 
following statements.

Staff at this facility…

* S9a. Are generally fair

* S9b. Do their best to make this facility safe and secure

* S9c. Try to meet the needs of the inmates

* S9d. Break up fights quickly

* S9e. Use physical force only when necessary

* S9f. Let inmates know what is expected of them

* S9g. Generally treat inmates with respect

* S9h. Follow facility rules when handling inmate complaints and grievances

* S9i. Often write up inmates who don’t deserve it.

The entire ACASI questionnaire (listed as the National Inmate Survey-3) and 
the shorter paper and pencil survey form (PAPI) are available on the BJS 
website.
