HIGHLIGHTS 

Funding 

*During fiscal year (FY) 2016, BJS held meetings with justice professionals 
from state, local, and tribal law enforcement and state and local prosecutor  
offices to obtain input on the planning and development of surveys of state  
and local justice agencies that serve tribal lands. 

*The Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies Serving Tribal Lands  
and the Census of State and Local Prosecutor Offices Serving Tribal Lands are  
now under review at the Office of Management and Budget. 

*In 2015, BJS awarded a cooperative agreement to fund the 2016 Census of  
Tribal Law Enforcement Agencies, the first BJS statistical collection targeting 
tribal law enforcement and Bureau of Indian Affairs’ agencies in the lower 48  
states and Alaska. 

*Data collection for the National Survey of Tribal Court Systems concluded  
at the end of 2015. 

Most recent findings 

*At midyear 2014, a total of 2,380 inmates were confined in 79 Indian country  
jails—a 4% increase from the 2,287 inmates confined at midyear 2013  
(Survey of Jails in Indian Country). 

*At midyear 2014, local jails held about 10,400 American Indian and Alaska  
Native (AIAN) inmates (i.e., nontribal and tribal AIAN), which was 1.4% of the 
total (744,600) jail inmate population in the United States 
(Annual Survey of Jails). 

*During 2013, a total of 2,882 AIAN (both tribal and nontribal) were  
arrested by federal law enforcement agencies, 1,429 were sentenced in  
U.S. district courts, 1,740 entered federal prison, and 1,737 exited federal
prison (Federal Criminal Case Processing Statistics)

Background
************

Enacted in 2010, the Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA)
requires the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to (1) establish
and implement a tribal data collection system, (2) consult
with Indian tribes to establish and implement this data
collection system, and (3) annually report to Congress the
data collected and analyzed in accordance with the act
(P.L. 111-211, 124 Stat. 2258, § 251(b)). This report describes
the fiscal year (FY) 2016 activities in support of BJS’s tribal
crime data collection system and summarizes findings and
program enhancements.

A total of 566 tribal entities in the lower 48 states and in
Alaska were eligible for funding and services from the
Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in 2016. ***Footnote 1. See Indian Entities  
Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services from the United States  
Bureau of Indian Affairs at https://www.federalregister.
gov/articles/2016/01/29/2016-01769/indian-entities-recognizedand-
eligible-to-receive-services-from-the-united-states-bureau-ofindian#
h-4.*** There were 334 federally and state-recognized  
American Indian reservations in 2010, the most recent  
available data. *** Footnote 2. For more information about federally 
recognized tribes, reservations, and Alaska Native village statistical  
areas, see Tribal Crime Data Collection Activities, 2012 at  
http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/tcdca12.pdf.***
An estimated 4.8 million people lived on American Indian 
reservations or in Alaska Native villages in the United States 
in 2010. About a quarter (1.1 million) of these individuals in 
2010 classified themselves as American Indian or Alaska Native (AIAN). 

The tribal justice system in Indian country  
varies across tribal nations and regions of the country. Criminal
jurisdiction in Indian country—federally recognized
reservations, tribal communities, and identified trust
lands—varies by type of crime committed, whether the
off ender or victim is a tribal member, and the state in which
the offense occurred. Due to the sovereign status of federally
recognized tribes in the United States, crimes committed in
Indian country are often subject to concurrent jurisdiction
among multiple criminal justice agencies.

More than 300 tribes in the United States are under mandatory
or optional Public Law 83-280 jurisdictions. Public Law 83-
280 (commonly referred to as Public Law 280 or P.L. 280)
conferred criminal jurisdiction from the federal government
to six state governments: California, Minnesota (except the
Red Lake Reservation), Nebraska, Oregon (except the Warm
Springs Reservation), Wisconsin, and Alaska. These states
have mandatory jurisdiction over crimes committed in Indian
country. P.L. 280 also permitted other states to acquire optional
jurisdiction either in whole or in part over Indian country
within their boundaries: Nevada, Idaho, Iowa, Washington,
South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Arizona, and Utah. In
states where P.L. 280 does not apply, the federal government
retains criminal jurisdiction for major crimes committed in
Indian country. ***Footnote 3. Federal jurisdiction in Indian country is  
established under the Indian Country Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 1152),  
the Indian Country Major Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 1153), and the  
Assimilative Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 13).***

Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies
Serving Tribal Lands and Census of State and Local
Prosecutor Offices Serving Tribal Lands
**************************************************

During FY 2016, BJS continued efforts to fill the information
gap on the role of nontribal state and local law enforcement
agencies and prosecutor offices in providing and supporting
criminal justice functions and services on tribal lands. The
services and functions on tribal lands are based on federal
mandates (Public Law 280) or consensual jurisdictional
arrangements made between tribal and state governments.
BJS has designed two surveys to document tribal-related law
enforcement and courts activities and caseloads: the Census
of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies Serving Tribal
Lands and the Census of State and Local Prosecutor Offices
Serving Tribal Lands. These data collections will provide
information on the legal and structural procedures in place to
address crime on tribal lands.

In FY 2016, BJS formed an expert panel comprised of state,
local, and tribal law enforcement officers and prosecutors
to provide input on designing the two data collections.
Participants on the panel included representatives from—

* Alaska State Troopers, Alaska
* Apache Junction Police Department, Arizona
* Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, Washington, D.C.
* Beadle County State’s Attorney Office, South Dakota
* Cass County State’s Attorney Office, Minnesota
* Cherokee Nation Marshal Service, Oklahoma
* International Association of Chiefs of Police, Indian
Country Law Enforcement Section, Washington, D.C.
* Miccosukee Tribal Police Department, Oklahoma
* National District Attorneys Association, Virginia
* National Sheriffs Association, Indian Affairs Committee,
Washington, D.C.
* Prosecuting Attorneys Coordinating Council, Michigan
* Riverside County Sheriff’s Office, California
* Roosevelt County Sheriff’s Office, Montana
* San Diego District Attorney’s Office, California
* South Dakota Highway Patrol, South Dakota
* Sycuan Tribal Police Department, California

BJS pilot tested draft s of the law enforcement and prosecutor
censuses in August and September 2015. The data collection
instruments were revised and improved using feedback from
the pilot study and are pending final approval from the Office
of Management and Budget (OMB).

Although BJS has included tribal law enforcement agencies
in previous iterations of the Census of State and Local Law
Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA), those surveys were not
specifically designed to capture information on the unique
nature and characteristics of policing in Indian country. For
instance, the CSLLEA was not designed to gather data on (1)
the administration and management of tribal law enforcement
agencies and (2) the various changes that resulted from
passage of the TLOA that enhanced the sentencing authority
given to tribes, the Violence Against Women Act of 2005
(VAWA) requirement to establish protection order registries,
and the VAWA Reauthorization in 2013 that expanded
criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians regarding selected
domestic violence matters. In addition, the CSLLEA does
not collect information about the progress made by tribal
law enforcement agencies responsible for monitoring and
managing sex off enders since passage of the Adam Walsh
Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006.

*******************************************
Census of Tribal Law Enforcement Agencies
*******************************************

In 2015, BJS awarded the independent research organization
NORC, at the University of Chicago, the cooperative
agreement to conduct the 2016 Census of Tribal Law
Enforcement Agencies (CTLEA). NORC partnered with the
International Association of Chiefs of Police to administer the
data collection. This is the first BJS data collection targeted
solely at tribal law enforcement agencies. The survey is being
designed to capture the unique attributes of these agencies,
including information on—

* criminal jurisdiction, staffing, and recruitment
* officer training, budgets, and sources of funding
* workloads and arrests
* access to and participation in regional and national justice
database systems
* special topics like human trafficking, domestic violence, and
child abuse
* access to domestic violence and protection order registries
* monitoring of sex offenders on tribal lands
* reporting of crime data to the FBI’s Uniform Crime
Reporting Program
* special jurisdiction over non-Indian off enders for select
domestic violence cases.

The CTLEA will collect information from all tribal law
enforcement agencies in the lower 48 states, the VPSOs in
Alaska, and police agencies operated by the BIA. Due to their
inherent differences, each type of agency will have its own
customized survey form with a common core of items along
with a set of items designed to collect its unique attributes.
Since December 2015, BJS has coordinated meetings to
identify information needs with various Department of
Justice (DOJ) components (including the Bureau of Justice
Assistance, the National Institute of Justice, Office of Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency and Prevention, Office for Victims of
Crime, Community Oriented Policing) and the Department
of Interior’s (DOI) Bureau of Indian Affairs’ Office of Justice
Services. These components provided valuable input on the
gaps in available information and the type of data that would
help them better understand the challenges faced by tribal law
enforcement agencies. This input will help guide the contents
of the CTLEA survey instruments.

To ensure tribal governments and their law enforcement
agencies have a central role in the development, design, and
implementation of the CTLEA, BJS established a tribal justice
and law enforcement panel comprised of tribal leaders and
law enforcement representatives from across the country and
representatives from the DOJ’s Office of Tribal Justice, the
FBI’s Indian Country Crimes Unit, and the DOI’s Office of
Justice Services.

In addition, as part of the outreach and collaboration plans
for the CTLEA, the BJS acting director will send a letter to all
federally and state-recognized tribes across the United States
announcing the new survey and its significance and inviting
input from tribal nations in the design and development of
the survey instrument. Prior to conducting the CTLEA, BJS,
with the help of tribal justice experts, will explore methods
to achieve high survey response rates and will conduct field
tests of the various survey instruments. Following this work,
BJS will submit to OMB a request to approve the fielding of
the CTLEA.

*****************************************
National Survey of Tribal Court Systems
*****************************************

On December 31, 2015, BJS concluded the data collection for
the National Survey of Tribal Court Systems (NSTCS). The
NSTCS is BJS’s first statistical collection focusing solely on
tribal justice systems since the 2002 Census of Tribal Justice
Agencies gathered limited data on all justice agencies—
law enforcement, courts, and corrections. The NSTCS
gathered information on the administrative and operational
characteristics of tribal justice systems (including budgets,
staffing, the use of juries, and the appellate system); indigent
defense services; pretrial and probation programs; protection
orders; criminal, civil, domestic violence, and juvenile
caseloads; implementation of various enhanced sentencing
provisions of the TLOA; and various indigenous or traditional
dispute forums operating within Indian country. NSTCS used
three separate but compatible survey instruments customized
to the type and location of the tribal courts: tribal courts in the
lower 48 states, Alaska Native villages, and the BIA’s Code of
Federal Regulation (CFR) courts. 

BJS mailed surveys to 237 tribal courts or judicial forums
identified in the lower 48 states, to 75 in Alaska Native villages,
and to 7 BIA CFR courts. The NSTCS had an overall response
rate of 81%, which varied by the respondent type (table 1). The
response rate for the NSTCS was 83% for tribal courts in the
lower 48 states, 72% for the judicial forums in Alaska Native
villages, and 100% for the 7 CFR courts (that have jurisdiction
over 22 separate tribes or service areas). 

The development and implementation of the NSTCS received
invaluable assistance from several organizations and tribes:
* American Indian Development Associates, New Mexico
* American Probation and Parole Association, Kentucky
* Bristol Bay Native Association
* Bureau of Indian Affairs’ Office of Justice Services
* Hamline University School of Law, Minnesota
* Kansas University School of Law’s Tribal Law and
Government Center
* National Judicial College, the National Tribal Judicial
Center, Nevada
* National American Indian Court Judges Association
* Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, South Dakota
* The Supreme Court of the Navajo Nation, Arizona
* Syracuse University College of Law, the Center for
Indigenous Law, Governance, and Citizenship, New York
* Tanana Chiefs Conference
* Tanana Chiefs Conference, Alaska
* Tribal Law and Policy Institute
* Tribal Law and Policy Institute, California
* University of Colorado at Boulder, American Indian Law
Clinic
* University of North Dakota School of Law’s Tribal
Judicial Institute.

**************************************************
Tribal participation in national records and
information systems
**************************************************

During 2016, BJS continued to focus on improving tribal
participation in national record and information systems
through expanding tribal funding eligibility for the National
Criminal History Improvement Program (NCHIP) and the
National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)
Act Record Improvement Program (NARIP).

Federally recognized tribal governments are eligible to apply
for NCHIP funding, and tribes may submit applications as part
of a multi-tribe consortium. NCHIP serves as an umbrella for
various record-improvement activities and funding sources,
each of which has unique goals and objectives. BJS strongly
encourages states and tribes to ensure integrated record-improvement
initiatives, regardless of the funding source. 

The NCHIP aims to improve the nation’s safety and security
by enhancing the quality, completeness, and accessibility
of criminal history record information by ensuring
the nationwide implementation of criminal justice and
noncriminal justice background check systems. Despite
the tremendous progress made toward criminal record
improvements among states, several significant shortcomings
remain among tribal justice agencies. 

BJS has identified challenges confronting tribal nations. Many
tribes do not have the capabilities or requisite technologies to
support the transmission of records to national systems, either
through their own infrastructure or via the state. Additionally,
some tribes have not yet converted their manual records
to electronic versions. Some entities are not yet submitting
qualifying records to the National Crime Information Center
Protection Order File, and the FBI reports continued problems
with the appropriate flagging of protection orders regarding
the prohibition for fi rearm purchases. 

Federally recognized Indian tribal governments are eligible
to apply for NARIP funding. NARIP helps states and tribal
governments identify individuals prohibited by federal or state
law from possessing firearms. 

NARIP seeks to address the gap in information available to
NICS about prohibiting mental health adjudications and
commitments, and other prohibiting factors. Filling these
information gaps will better enable the system to operate as
intended—to keep guns out of the hands of persons prohibited
by federal or state law from receiving or possessing fi rearms.
The automation of records will also help reduce delays for
law-abiding persons purchasing guns. NARIP authorizes a
grant program to help states and tribes provide information to
NICS and prescribes grant penalties for noncompliance with
the act’s goals for complete records. 

NARIP provides grants to each state or tribal government
for use by the court systems to improve automation and
transmittal to federal and state repositories. Repository records
consist of (1) criminal history dispositions, (2) records relevant
to determining whether a person has been convicted of a
misdemeanor crime of domestic violence or whether a person
is the subject of a prohibiting domestic violence protection
order, and (3) prohibiting mental health adjudications
and commitments.

Most recent findings and access to tribal information
********************************************************


*************************
Jails in Indian country
*************************

The Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) is BJS’s only
national data collection that provides annual data on the
estimated 79 Indian country jails and detention facilities. BJS
initiated the SJIC in 1998 as a component of the Annual Survey
of Jails. The SJIC includes Indian country facilities operated
by tribal authorities or the BIA. The survey collected data
on the number of inmates, percentage of capacity occupied
based on the average daily population, midyear population,
and peak population in the facilities in June 2014. It also
gathered information on staffing, offense types, and conviction
status. The findings of the most recent SJIC data are available
in Jails in Indian Country, 2014 (NCJ 248974, BJS website,
October 2015).

In June 2014, local jails operated by county or municipal
authorities held about 10,400 AIAN inmates (both tribal
and nontribal AIAN), which was 1.4% of the total (744,600)
jail inmate population. See Jail Inmates at Midyear, 2014
(NCJ 248629, BJS web, June 2015.) Half of all AIAN jail
inmates were held in western states at yearend 2013 (the
most recent state-level data). See Census of Jails: Population
Changes, 1999–2013 (NCJ 248627, BJS web, December 2015.)
In comparison, an estimated 2,380 inmates were confined in
79 Indian country jails at midyear 2014, a 4% increase from
the 2,287 inmates confined at midyear 2013. The average
number of inmates per operating facility increased from 26
inmates in 2000 to 30 inmates in 2014. At midyear 2014, the
jail facilities in Indian country were rated to hold an estimated
3,720 inmates, up from 3,482 in 2013. ***Footnote 4. A rating official  
assigns the maximum number of beds or inmates a
facility can hold, excluding temporary holding areas.***  
Approximately 1,230 jail operations staff were employed to 
supervise the confined inmates in 2014, up slightly from the 
1,180 jail operations staff at midyear 2013. Footnote 5. Jail
operations staff include correctional officers, guards, and 
other staff who spend more than 50% of their time 
supervising inmates.***


Since 2000, the distribution of Indian country jail inmates by
sex and age has changed slightly. Although males represent
the largest portion of the inmate population in Indian country
jails, the percentage of female jail inmates increased from 20%
of all inmates in 2000 to 25% in 2014. The juvenile proportion
of the Indian country jail population declined from 16% in
2000 to 8% at midyear 2014. The distribution of inmates by
conviction status and offense type also showed some change.
After the percentage of convicted inmates peaked in 2009 at
69%, it declined to 51% by midyear 2014.

Since 2010, about 30% of inmates held in Indian country jails
were confined for a violent offense, a decline from a peak of
41% in 2007. At midyear 2014, domestic violence (12%) and
aggravated or simple assault (9%) accounted for the largest
percentage of violent off enders. Inmates held for unspecified
violence (5%) and rape or sexual assault (2%) accounted for
about 7% of the jail population. 

Patterns of decline were also observed among inmates held for
alcohol- and drug-related offenses. Inmates held for driving
while intoxicated or driving while under the influence of drugs
or alcohol declined from 16% of the total inmate population
in 2000 to 9% at midyear 2014. The percentage of inmates held
for a drug law violation declined from 8% in 2000 to 5% at
midyear 2014. 

In 2013, BJS enhanced the SJIC offense category questionnaire
item to include burglary, larceny-theft , and public intoxication.
The enhancement permitted better classification of previously
unspecified offenses. At midyear 2014, about a quarter of
persons being held in tribal jails were charged with public
intoxication (20%), burglary (2%), or larceny-theft (1%),
proportions similar to those in 2013.

***************************
Federal justice statistics
***************************

The Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP) provides annual
data on workload, activities, and outcomes associated with
federal criminal cases. It acquires information on all aspects
of processing in the federal justice system, including arrests,
initial prosecution decisions, referrals to courts or magistrates,
court dispositions, sentencing outcomes, sentence length, and
time served. The FJSP collects data from the U.S. Marshals
Service, the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, the U.S.
Office of Probation and Pretrial Services, the Administrative
Office of the U.S. Courts, the U.S. Sentencing Commission,
and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Through FJSP, BJS
compiles comprehensive information describing suspects and
defendants processed in the federal criminal justice system.

The FJSP captures an off ender’s race, but it does not provide
information on tribal membership. During 2013 (the most
recent federal data available), 2,882 AIAN were arrested and
booked by federal law enforcement agencies, up from 2,482 in
2012. There were 1,429 AIAN sentenced in U.S. district courts
in 2013, up from 1,355 in 2012. In 2013, 1,740 AIAN offenders
entered federal prison and 1,737 off enders exited federal
prison. At fiscal yearend 2013, 3,725 AIAN were held in federal
prison (1.9% of all prisoners).
