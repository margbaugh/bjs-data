In 2009, approximately 572,000 nonfatal violent crimes
(rape/sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and
simple assault) occurred against persons age 16 or
older while they were at work or on duty, based on findings
from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).
This accounted for about 24% of nonfatal violence against
employed persons age 16 or older. Nonfatal violence in
the workplace was about 15% of all nonfatal violent crime
against persons age 16 or older.

The rate of violent crime against employed persons has
declined since 1993. In 2009, an estimated 4 violent crimes
per 1,000 employed persons age 16 or older were committed
while the victims were at work or on duty, compared to 6
violent crimes per 1,000 employed persons age 16 or older
in 2002. In 1993, the rate of nonfatal violence was 16 violent
crimes per 1,000 employed persons while at work, a rate 75%
higher than in 2009 (figure 1).

According to 2009 preliminary data, 521 persons age 16
or older were victims of homicide in the workplace. In
about a third of workplace homicides from 2005-2009, the
victim worked in a sales or office occupation. The data on
homicides in this report are based on the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI).

Highlights

*From 2002 to 2009, the rate of nonfatal workplace violence
has declined by 35%, following a 62% decline in the rate
from 1993 to 2002.

*The average annual rate of workplace violence between
2005 and 2009 (5 violent crimes per 1,000 employed
persons age 16 or older) was about one-third the rate
of nonworkplace violence (16 violent crimes per 1,000
employed persons age 16 or older) and violence against
persons not employed (17 violent crimes per 1,000 persons
age 16 or older).

*Between 2005 and 2009, law enforcement officers, security
guards, and bartenders had the highest rates of nonfatal
workplace violence.

*Strangers committed the greatest proportion of nonfatal
workplace violence against males (53%) and females (41%)
between 2005 and 2009.

*Among workplace homicides that occurred between 2005
and 2009, about 28% involved victims in sales and related
occupations and about 17% involved victims in protective
service occupations.

*About 70% of workplace homicides were committed
by robbers and other assailants while about 21% were
committed by work associates between 2005 and 2009.

*Between 2005 and 2009, while firearms were used in 5% of
nonfatal workplace violence, shootings accounted for 80%
of workplace homicides.

This report provides an overview of fatal and nonfatal
violence in the workplace. It discusses differences in
workplace violence among various occupations. It includes
trend information and discusses victim demographics
and crime characteristics such as victim injury and police
notification. It also includes comparisons to violence outside
of the workplace against employed persons and violence
against persons not employed.

Workplace violence declined more rapidly than
nonworkplace violence from 1993 to 2009

The 2009 rate of workplace violence (4 violent crimes per
1,000 employed persons age 16 or older) was 35% lower
than the 2002 rate of workplace violence (6 violent crimes
per 1,000). The 2009 rate of nonworkplace violence was 37%
lower than the 2002 nonworkplace violence rate. There was
no statistically significant difference detected in the 2002
and 2009 rates of violence against persons not employed.
From 1993 to 2002, the rate of workplace violence declined
by 62%. In comparison, the rate of nonworkplace violence
was 51% lower in 2002 than in 1993 and the rate of violence
against persons not employed was 47% lower in 2002 than in
1993.

Workplace violence declined more rapidly for males
than females from 1993 to 2009

The 2009 workplace violence rate for males was 29% lower
than the 2002 rate (figure 2). The rate for females in 2009
was 43% lower than their 2002 rate. The rate of workplace
violence against males was 69% lower in 2002 than in
1993. In comparison, the rate of workplace violence against
females was 48% lower in 2002 than in 1993. There was no
statistically significant difference detected in the 2002 or
2009 rates of workplace violence for males and females.

The 2009 workplace violence rate was 33% lower than the
2002 rate for whites (figure 3). The 2009 workplace violence
rate against blacks was 63% lower than the 2002 rate for
blacks. Workplace violence rates against whites, blacks, and
Hispanics were at least 60% lower in 2002 than in 1993.

Workplace violence occurred at a lower rate than both
nonworkplace violence and violence against persons
not employed

From 2005 through 2009, the average annual rate of
violent victimization in the workplace against employed
persons age 16 or older was about 5 violent crimes per
1,000 persons (table 1). In comparison, the average annual
rate of nonworkplace violence was about 16 violent crimes
per 1,000 employed persons ages 16 or older. The average
annual rate of violence against persons not employed was
about 17 violent crimes per 1,000 ages 16 or older. For each
type of nonfatal violent crime examined, rates of workplace
violence were lower than rates of nonworkplace violence for
employed people and violence against persons not employed.

Workplace violence was less likely to include serious
violence (rape/sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated
assault) than nonworkplace violence and violence against
persons not employed. About a fifth of workplace violence
from 2005 through 2009 consisted of serious violent
crime, compared to almost two-fifths of nonworkplace
violence and violence against persons not employed. The
percentage of robbery in the workplace (3%) was a fourth
the percentage for nonworkplace violence and violence
against persons not employed. Simple assault accounted for
almost 80% of workplace violence while it constituted about
61% of violence against persons not employed and 62% of
nonworkplace violence.

From 2005 through 2009 persons working in law
enforcement experienced about 19% of workplace
violence while accounting for 2% of employed persons

Among the occupations measured, persons in law
enforcement experienced the highest proportion (19%)
of workplace violence (table 2). Persons in retail sales
occupations experienced about 13% of workplace violence
while accounting for about 9% of employed persons. About
10% of victims of workplace violence worked in medical
occupations.

Law enforcement officers, security guards, and
bartenders had the highest rate of workplace violence

From 2005 through 2009, of the occupational groups
examined, law enforcement occupations had the highest
average annual rate of workplace violence (48 violent 
crimes per 1,000 employed persons age 16 or older), 
followed by mental health occupations (21 per 1,000). 
Among the individual occupations examined, no occupation
had workplace violence rates higher than those for law
enforcement officers, security guards, and bartenders.

Bartenders (80 per 1,000) had the highest workplace
violence rate of all retail sales occupations. Persons 
working in all mental health occupations had a similar 
rate of workplace violence. Among teaching occupations, 
no occupation had a higher rate of workplace violence than
persons working in technical or industrial schools. All
transportation occupations had a similar rate of workplace
violence.

Persons working in custodial care, technical/industrial
schools, and law enforcement had higher rates of
workplace violence than nonworkplace violence

The rate of workplace violence was greater than the rate 
of nonworkplace violence for several occupations examined.
For persons in custodial care occupations, workers in
technical/industrial schools, law enforcement officers,
corrections officers, and security guards, the rate of
workplace violence was higher than the rate of nonworkplace
violence. For nurses and persons working in preschools and
colleges/universities, and convenience store/liquor store
clerks, the rate of workplace violence was lower than the 
rate of violence outside of the workplace.

No occupational group had a higher rate of nonworkplace
violence than retail sales occupations. All retail sales
occupations had an equal rate of nonworkplace violence.
While law enforcement officers and security guards were
among the occupations with the highest rate of workplace
violence, these occupations did not have the highest rate
of nonworkplace violence among the examined occupations.

For all gender and racial groups examined, the rate
of workplace violence was lower than the rate of
nonworkplace violence

From 2005 through 2009, males had a higher rate
of workplace violence and a slightly higher rate of
nonworkplace violence than females (table 3). Whites had a
higher rate of workplace violence than blacks, while blacks
had a higher rate of nonworkplace violence than whites.
There was no statistically significant difference between
whites and American Indians in the rate of workplace
violence. Hispanics were similar to blacks and Asians
in their rates of workplace violence. Asians were the least
likely of all racial/ethnic groups examined to experience
nonworkplace violence.

Among employed persons, those ages 20 to 34 had the
highest rate of workplace violence while persons ages 16 to
19 had the highest rate of nonworkplace violence. Persons
who had never married had a higher rate of workplace
violence than those who were married and the same rate
as persons who were widowed, divorced, or separated.
Persons in households with annual incomes of $50,000 to
$74,999 had similar rates of workplace violence as persons
in households with annual incomes of $7,500 to $14,999.
Individuals in households with lower annual incomes had
a higher rate of nonworkplace violence than individuals in
households with higher annual incomes.

From 2005 through 2009 victims of workplace violence
had a higher percentage of males, whites, married
persons, and persons in households with larger annual
incomes than victims of nonworkplace violence

Males accounted for about 63% of victims of workplace
violence and 57% of victims of nonworkplace violence
(table 4). Whites made up a larger percentage of workplace
violence victims (78%) than nonworkplace violence victims
(66%). Both blacks and Hispanics accounted for smaller
percentages of victims of workplace violence (9% black,
8% Hispanic) than victims of nonworkplace violence (13%
black, 15% Hispanic).

Workplace violence had a larger proportion of older victims
than nonworkplace violence. About 54% of workplace
violence victims were ages 35 or older while 39% of
nonworkplace violence victims were of similar ages. About
17% of workplace violence victims were ages 16 to 24 while
about 36% of nonworkplace violence victims fell into this
age category.

About 35% of victims of workplace violence had never
married, compared to about 52% of victims of nonworkplace
violence. Married persons accounted for about 47% of
workplace violence victims and about 25% of nonworkplace
violence victims. About 46% of victims of workplace
violence were in households with annual incomes of at least
$50,000, compared to about 28% of victims of nonworkplace
violence.

Strangers committed the greatest proportion of
workplace violence

From 2005 through 2009, strangers committed about 53%
of workplace violence against males and about 41% against
females (table 5). Similar proportions of males and females
were victims of intimate partner violence in the workplace.
About a quarter (26%) of workplace violence against males
and about a third against females were committed by
someone with whom the victim had a work relationship.
***Footnote 1 Work relationships include offenders who 
were customers, clients, patients, and current or former 
supervisors, employees, or coworkers of the victim.***
Among the work relationships examined, coworkers were
the most likely to attack persons in the workplace. Current
or former coworkers committed 16% of workplace violence
against males and about 14% against females. Patients
committed a higher percentage of workplace violence against
females than males.

Victims of workplace violence were slightly less likely to 
have resisted their offenders than victims of nonworkplace 
violence

Three in 5 incidents of workplace violence involved victims
who resisted their offenders (table 6). From 2005 through
2009, victims resisted their offenders in about 60% of all
incidents of workplace violence. While equally likely to use
nonconfrontational tactics, victims of workplace violence
were less likely than victims of nonworkplace violence to
threaten or attack an offender without a weapon.

Workplace violence was less likely to involve an
offender under the influence of alcohol or drugs than
nonworkplace violence

A smaller percentage of workplace violence (25%) involved
an offender under the influence of alcohol or drugs than
nonworkplace violence (37%), according to victims (table 7).
About 40% of workplace violence did not involve an offender
under the influence of alcohol or drugs, compared to about
22% of nonworkplace violence.

Firearms were less likely to be present in workplace
violence than nonworkplace violence

Weapons were less likely to be present in workplace
violence than during nonworkplace violence (table 8).
From 2005 through 2009, weapons were present in about
18% of workplace violence and about 27% of nonworkplace
violence. Firearms were present in about 5% of workplace
violence and about 10% of nonworkplace violence.

From 2005 through 2009, victims of workplace violence
(13%) were less likely to be injured than victims of
nonworkplace violence (29%) (table 9). The percentage of
workplace violence victims who had serious injuries (2%)
was lower than the percentage of victims of nonworkplace
violence (4%) (table 10).

Workplace violence was slightly less likely than
nonworkplace violence to be reported to police

About 47% of workplace violence was reported to police,
compared to about 52% of nonworkplace violence (table
11). A smaller percentage of nonworkplace violence against
males was reported to police than nonworkplace violence
against females. However, police notification of workplace
violence did not differ by the victim's gender. No statistically
significant differences were found between the percentages
of nonworkplace and workplace violence against whites,
blacks, American Indians, and Asians reported to the police.
For Hispanics, a slightly higher percentage of nonworkplace
than workplace violence incidents was reported to the police.

For victims ages 34 or younger, there was no statistically
significant difference in the percentages of nonworkplace
and workplace violence reported to the police. For victims
ages 35 or older, workplace violence was at least slightly less
likely than nonworkplace violence to be reported to police.

About 77% of workplace robberies were brought to the
attention of the police. This percentage is lower than the
percentages found for workplace rape/sexual assault and
simple assault and similar to the percentage found for
workplace aggravated assault. Robbery in the workplace was
slightly more likely to be reported to police than robbery
outside of the workplace.

The most common reasons for reporting workplace
violence to the police were to stop or prevent an
incident from happening (31%), prevent future
incidents (21%), and stop attacker (20%)

This rank ordering of reasons was similar to that for
nonworkplace violence (41%, 31%, and 13%) (table 12).
However, a lower percentage of workplace violence (31%)
was reported to the police than nonworkplace violence
(41%) to stop or prevent the crime from happening.
Reports intended to prevent the offender from committing
future crimes against the victim were less likely for
incidents of workplace violence (21%) than for incidents
of nonworkplace violence (31%). About 14% of workplace
violence was reported out of duty to inform the police about
crime compared to 7% of nonworkplace violence that was
reported for such a reason.

The most common reason why workplace violence was
not reported to the police was that the incident was
reported to another official

About 38% of workplace violence was not reported to the
police because the incident was reported to another official,
compared to about 7% of nonworkplace violence (table
13). Similar to the percentages of nonworkplace violence
that were not reported to police, about 22% of workplace
violence was not reported to police because the victim
thought the incident was a personal matter. About 24% of
workplace violence was not reported to police because the
victim believed that the incident was not important enough
to be reported.

The number of homicides in the workplace decreased
by 51% between 1993 and 2009

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Census of
Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), the number of victims
ages 16 or older of workplace homicides decreased by
39% from 1,068 in 1993 to 648 in 1999 (figure 4). The
number decreased again in 2004 to 559. In 2009, based on
preliminary data, there were 521 workplace homicides,
a decrease from 2008 when there were 526 workplace
homicides.

From 2005 through 2009, a third of workplace
homicide victims worked in sales-related occupations

In about 33% of workplace homicides that occurred
from 2005 through 2009, the victim worked in a sales or
office occupation (table 14). This includes sales-related
occupations, which made up 28% of the occupations of
workplace homicide victims. A third of workplace homicide
victims worked in service occupations, including persons
working in protective services. Persons in protective service
occupations accounted for 17% of workplace homicide
victims.

The majority of victims of workplace homicide from
2005 through 2009 were male and middle-aged

Males accounted for 4 in 5 victims of workplace homicide
(table 15). From 2005 through 2009, about 48% of all
workplace homicide victims were between the ages of 35
and 54, about 21% were ages 55 or older, and about 10%
were ages 16 to 24. Whites accounted for about half of all
workplace homicide victims while blacks represented about
a fifth of all victims. In comparison, Hispanics accounted for
16% of all workplace homicide victims; Asians accounted for 11%

Robbers and other assailants accounted for the
majority of workplace homicide offenders

From 2005 through 2009, about 38% of workplace homicide
offenders were robbers (table 16). Work associates
accounted for about a fifth, and customers and clients
represented about 10% of all workplace homicide offenders.
Current and former coworkers committed 11% of workplace
homicides. Spouses constituted about 3% of offenders in
workplace homicides.

Most workplace homicides resulted from shootings
Shootings accounted for about 80% of workplace homicides
from 2005 through 2009 (table 17). About 14% of workplace
homicides resulted from stabbings, hittings, kickings, or
beatings.

Methodology

Data sources

This report presents data on rape, sexual assault, robbery,
aggravated assault, and simple assault against persons age
16 or older while they were at work or on duty as measured
by the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).
The NCVS gathers data on crimes against persons age 12
or older, reported and not reported to the police, from
a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.
The NCVS provides information about victims (e.g. age,
gender, race, Hispanic origin, marital status, income, and
educational level), offenders (e.g., gender, race, approximate
age, and victim/offender relationship), and the nature of the
crime (time and place of occurrence, use of weapons, nature
of injury, and economic consequences). Respondents to the
NCVS age 16 or older are asked to select one occupation that
best describes their job. More information on the National
Crime Victimization Survey can be found here: http://bjs.
ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=245.

Data on workplace homicide were obtained from the
Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI), collected by
the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Workplace homicide
information for 2009 is based on preliminary data. Data
for 1993-2008 are based on final data from the CFOI. As
reported on the BLS website, CFOI produces comprehensive,
accurate, and timely counts of fatal work injuries. CFOI
is a federal-state cooperative program that has been
implemented in all 50 States and the District of Columbia
since 1992.

To compile counts that are as complete as possible, the
census uses multiple sources to identify, verify, and profile
fatal worker injuries annually. Information about each
workplace fatal injury from all workplaces--occupation
and other worker characteristics, equipment involved,
and circumstances of the event--is obtained by cross
referencing the source records, such as death certificates,
workers' compensation reports, and federal and state
agency administrative reports. To ensure that fatal injuries
are work-related, cases are substantiated with two or more
independent source documents, or a source document and
a follow-up questionnaire. Data compiled by the CFOI
program are issued annually for the preceding calendar year.
The National Safety Council has adopted the Census of Fatal
Occupational Injuries figure, beginning with the 1992 data
year, as the authoritative count for work related deaths in the
United States. More information about CFOI can be found
here: http//www.bls.gov/iif/oshfat1.htm.

Occupational categories in the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS) and Census of Fatal
Occupational Injuries (CFOI)

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and the
Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) use different
systems of categorizing occupations of victims.

The NCVS began using the occupation categories
displayed in this report after the 1992 redesign. In 2001,
the employment questions were revised on the incident
form using the Industry and Occupation coding of the
1990 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) coding
system. However, the screening questionnaire remained
the same. In order to generate rates of workplace violence
by occupation, the occupation categories on the incident
form were collapsed into the occupation categories used
on the screening questionnaire. Population estimates were
generated from the screening questionnaire and incidents
of workplace violence were generated using the collapsed
categories from the incident form.

Beginning with the 2003 reference year, CFOI began using
the 2002 North American Industry Classification System
(NAICS) for industries, and the Standard Occupational
Classification System (SOC) for occupations. Prior to 2003,
the program used the Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) system and the Bureau of the Census occupational
classification system. For more information, see
www.bls.gov/iif/osh_wtre02.htm. Due to the methodology
of the NCVS involving victim interviews, it was impossible
to obtain information on the occupations of workplace
homicide victims. Therefore, CFOI was used to gain
this information despite differing systems of classifying
occupational 

Methodological changes to the NCVS in 2006

Methodological changes implemented in 2006 impacted the
estimates for that year to an extent that the estimates 
were not comparable to those of previous years. An evaluation
of 2007 and 2008 data from the NCVS conducted by BJS
and the Census Bureau found a high degree of confidence
that estimates for 2007 and 2008 are consistent with and
comparable to those for 2005 and previous years. For this
reason, discussion of trends in the rates of crime in this
report excludes the 2006 data.

Data from 2006 are included in tables displaying aggregate
estimates because the effects from methodological changes 
implemented in 2006 did not impact the distributions 
across the variables describing the characteristics and 
consequences of crime. The effects on the 2006 estimates 
were on the levels and rates of crime,requiring omission 
from discussions of crime trends. Inclusion of 2006 data 
in tables providing aggregate estimates does not affect 
the comparisons presented in these tables.

Standard error computations

Comparisons of percentages and rates made in this report
were tested to determine if observed differences were
statistically significant. Differences described as higher,
lower, or different passed a hypothesis test at the 0.05 level
of statistical significance (95% confidence level). The tested
difference was greater than twice the standard error of that
difference. For comparisons that were statistically significant
at the 0.10 level (90% confidence level), "somewhat," "slightly," 
or "marginally" is used to note the nature of the difference.

Significance testing calculations were conducted at the
Bureau of Justice Statistics using statistical programs
developed specifically for the NCVS by the U.S. Census
Bureau. These programs take into consideration many
aspects of the complex NCVS sample design when
calculating estimates.

Standard errors for average annual estimates were calculated
based on the ratio of the sums of victimizations and respondents
across years. Estimates based on 10 or fewer sample cases have high
relative standard errors. Care should be taken when
comparing such estimates to other estimates when both are
based on 10 or fewer sample cases.
