On average each month an estimated 6,600 firearm purchases 
were prevented by background checks of potential gun buyers 
during the 28 months after the effective date of the Brady 
Handgun Violence Prevention Act.  The checks revealed purchasers' 
ineligibility under Federal or State laws to buy a handgun or 
other firearm.  Over 70% of the rejected purchasers 
were convicted or indicted felons.

Note:  All estimated counts are rounded.  
Percentages were calculated from unrounded data.
Detail may not add to total because of rounding.
/aInformation was provided by the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  The 
estimates include all types of guns.
/bBased on 176 sources in 44 States. The estimates 
reflect only applications for purchase of handguns.
/cOriginal Brady States are the 32 States required 
to follow presale review procedures set out in the
Brady Act when it became effective on February
28, 1994.  (See the table on page 3.)


*Presale background checks of persons applying to buy a handgun 
or long gun resulted in about 6,600 rejections each month.  
This estimate, covering the period between March 1, 1994, 
and June 30, 1996, includes both States operating under 
the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (Brady States) 
and States with comparable statutes preventing gun sales 
to prohibited persons (Brady-alternative States).  

*More than 7 in 10 of the rejections occurred when 
potential buyers were found to have had a felony 
conviction or to be under felony indictment.

-------------------------------------------------  

Between March 1994 and June 1996, for all States together, 
there were almost 9 million applications to purchase firearms 
and an estimated 186,000 rejections.  The data do not 
indicate whether rejected purchasers later obtained a 
firearm through other means. 

On average each month, an estimated 3,100 applications 
were rejected in the 32 States that followed the review 
procedures set forth in the Brady Act when it became 
effective in February 1994 ("original Brady States").  
During the period from March 1994 through June 1996, 
there were 86,000 rejections from a total of about 
4.2 million applications or inquiries.

These are the first BJS statistics from an ongoing 
survey to assess the impact of presale checks on preventing 
sales of handguns and long guns to persons in prohibited categories.  
The categories are defined in the Federal Gun Control Act of 
1968 or related State legislation.  (See Background below.)  

In the most recent 6 months for which national data were collected, 
January to June 1996, gun dealers made more than 1.3 million inquiries 
about the eligibility of potential buyers of handguns.  About 34,000 
ineligible customers were identified, a rejection rate of 2.6%. For 
the original Brady States during the most recent period, 570,000 
inquiries or applications resulted in 16,000 rejections.  
This represented a 2.8% rejection rate.

During the first half of 1996, almost three-fourths of 
rejections of a handgun purchase were based on a finding of a 
felony conviction or indictment.  Although not all States have 
the capability to check nonfelon categories, fugitives from 
justice (6%), persons who violated State laws (4%), and persons 
under court restraining or protective orders (2%) accounted for 
the next largest categories of rejections.  

------------------------------------------

juveniles, aliens, violators of local ordinances,
those who have renounced citizenship, persons
dishonorably discharged, and unspecified.
------------------------------------------

As of midyear 1996, 14 States reported that presale checks 
included a check of outstanding restraining orders; 11 States 
reported that checks of mental health records are made in 
connection with presale firearm checks.  

When only those States that reported searching data bases 
for reasons other than felony status are considered, 
rejections for such reasons accounted for the following:

                         Percent of rejections 
                         in States which search

reason                   nonfelony reasons 

Fugitive                          6%
Restraining orders                4
Mental illness                    2

Sources of data

The findings are based on data collected by the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and BJS.  Data for 1994 and 1995, provided 
by ATF, were calculated using the number of firearm-coded inquiries 
to the FBI's criminal history database.  The percentage of denials 
used for ATF estimates was based on the experiences of jurisdictions 
that had implemented presale firearms check procedures prior to the Brady Act. 

Data for the first half of 1996 were collected under the BJS Firearm 
Inquiry Statistics (FIST) program.  The results were from a survey of 
600 law enforcement agencies, of which 176 in 44 States responded.  

----------------------------------------------------
Background
----------------------------------------------------

The provisions of  the Federal Gun Control Act (18 U.S.C. sec. 922 (g) 
and (n) as amended) prohibit the sale of firearms to an individual who--

*is under indictment for, or has been  convicted of, a crime punishable 
by imprisonment for more than 1 year;
*is a fugitive from justice;
*is an unlawful user of a controlled substance;
*has been adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to a mental
institution;
*is an alien unlawfully in the United States;
*was discharged from the armed forces under dishonorable conditions;
*has renounced U.S. citizenship;
*is subject to a court order restraining him or her from harassing, stalking, 
or threatening an intimate partner or child; or 
*is a person convicted of domestic violence.

----------------------------------------------------
Brady Act
----------------------------------------------------

The Brady Act was enacted in November 1993 and became effective in 
February 1994 (Note:  Data collection began after the effective date of the
Brady
Handgun Violence Prevention Act (P.L. 103-159) on February 28, 1994.)
The interim provisions of the act require that licensed firearm dealers 
request a presale check on all potential handgun purchasers from the 
Chief Law Enforcement Officer (CLEO) in the jurisdiction where the 
prospective purchaser resides.  

The CLEO must make a reasonable effort to determine if the purchaser 
is prohibited from receiving or possessing a handgun.  The Federal 
firearms licensee must wait 5 business days before transferring the 
handgun to the buyer unless earlier approval is received from the CLEO.  
These interim procedures will terminate no later than November 30, 1998.  

The "interim provision" also permits States to follow a variety of 
alternatives to the 5-day waiting period.  These alternatives include 
States that issue firearm permits, perform "instant checks," or conduct 
"point-of-sale" checks.  To qualify under these alternatives, State law 
must require that before any licensee completes the transfer of a handgun 
to a nonlicensee, a government official verify that possession of a 
handgun by the transferee would not be a violation of law.  Example of 
Brady-alternative States include California ("point-of-sale check"), 
Virginia ("instant check"), and Missouri (permit).  

After November 1998 instant background checks will be required for purchasers 
of all firearms.  The background check will determine, based on available
records, 
if an individual is prohibited under the Federal Gun Control Act or State law 
from receiving or possessing firearms. 

Under the "permanent provisions" of the Brady Act, presale inquiries will be 
made through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS).  
The act requires the NICS, which will be operated by the FBI, to be 
established no later than November 1998.  At that time the procedures 
related to the waiting period of the interim system will be eliminated. 
 
Under the FBI's proposed NICS configuration, State criminal history 
records will be provided through each State's central repository and 
the Interstate Identification Index.  The index, maintained by the FBI, 
points instantly to criminal records that States hold.  In addition, 
the FBI will provide records of Federal offenses, Federally maintained 
State data, and Federal data on nonfelony disqualifications.  States 
responding to NICS inquiries for nonfelony prohibitions will provide 
their records directly.

The National Criminal History 
Improvement Program (NCHIP)
----------------------------------------------------

To ensure immediate availability of complete and accurate State records, 
the Brady Act established a grant program authorized at $200 million. 
The program is to assist States to develop criminal history record systems 
and improve the interface with the NICS.   

A major goal of the grant program is the interstate availability of complete 
State records when the NICS is implemented.  Toward this goal, over 
$112 million was awarded in direct awards to States during fiscal years 
1995 and 1996.  NCHIP program funds have also supported direct technical 
assistance to States, evaluation, and related research.

----------------------------------------------------
Firearm Inquiry Statistics program
----------------------------------------------------

The FIST program was established under the NCHIP to develop data on 
the impact of presale firearm checks on the identification of prohibited 
firearm purchasers.  None of the FIST information provided from agencies 
to BJS contains or reveals the identity of individual applicants.  

Information requested for the survey does not include data traceable to an
applicant, and the computer program that some agencies use to collect FIST 
data transmits only the appropriately aggregated or categorized responses.  
The computer program also assists agencies in purging records after the delay 
times specified in law.

An initial report describing State background check procedures, Survey of 
State Procedures Related to Firearm Sales (NCJ-160763), was released in May
1996.  
Data summarizing the number of inquiries, rejections, and reasons for 
rejections are collected regularly and will be summarized and released
semiannually.  

----------------------------------------------------
Applicable State legislation
----------------------------------------------------

When the Brady Act became effective on February 28, 1994, 32 States 
and Puerto Rico were required to follow presale review procedures 
set out in the act.  The remaining States were Brady-alternative States.  
Since then, 10 more States have enacted legislation to become 
Brady-alternative States (Colorado, March 1994; Georgia, January 1996; 
Idaho, June 1994, Louisiana, May 1996; Minnesota, August 1994; 
New Hampshire, January 1995; North Carolina, December 1995; Tennessee, 
May 1994; Utah, March 1994; and Washington, June 1996).  


Methodology

The following presents the approach used to derive the 6-month estimate 
(for the period January to June 1996) from a sample of law enforcement 
offices charged with determining eligibility to purchase a firearm.

----------------------------------------------------
Data collection
----------------------------------------------------

For those States with local chief law enforcement officers (local CLEO's), 
CLEO's were randomly selected within each of the population size categories, 
based upon 1990 Census data: categories A (under 10,000 residents), 
B (10,000 to 100,000), C (over 100,000).  The sample was also stratified 
between Brady States and Brady-alternative States.  
  
A total of 176 CLEO's submitted data in time for this survey: 63 in 
category A, 55 in B, 36 in C, and 22 statewide CLEO's.  Some agencies 
carried out presale determinations for other agencies or had 
determinations done for them by other agencies.  The populations 
accorded these agencies were adjusted, based on the number of 
residents they actually served.

----------------------------------------------------
Calculation of estimates
----------------------------------------------------

(1) Census data for 1990 were used to calculate relative weights of 
samples from local and State CLEO's.  The estimated 1990 population 
for the 50 States was 248,102,973. 

(2) At least some data were received from 44 States.  The general 
procedure to estimate all 50 States was --

(a) For each size category the populations for those agencies that 
submitted data and for all agencies of that size were totaled.  
A factor was computed from these two numbers.

(b) The raw number of applications and rejections (in sum and for 
each rejection category) were totaled for each size group.

(c) For the estimated number of applications and estimated number 
of rejections, the totals were multiplied by the factor computed 
in (a) for each size group.

(d) The totals for all size groups were added together to get the 
totals for the numbers of applications and rejections.

(e) To get the estimated number in each reason-for-rejection category, 
the percentage of the total raw rejections was calculated, and that 
percentage was multiplied by the estimated total number of rejections.

(3) New Jersey submitted data for total applications and rejections, 
but no reasons for rejections or breakdowns for its local CLEO's. 
Data for local CLEO's in New Jersey were ignored. Alaska submitted 
data for most of that State's CLEO's.  This study categorized both 
States as State reporting agencies.

(4) Of the three States that changed from Brady to Brady-alternative 
States after 1995, Georgia (1/1/96) was considered a Brady-alternative 
State, and Louisiana (5/7/96) and Washington (6/6/96), Brady States.

(5) Two large cities were analyzed separately because of their high 
rejection rates; their averages were not used to estimate the overall 
rejection rates. Their numbers of rejections were included in the 
final total, however.

(6) Agencies for the following States reported data for applications 
and rejections but no data for reasons for rejection:  Alaska, Indiana, 
New Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio, and West Virginia.
(7) To evaluate properly the application and rejection rates for 
purchasing populations within a given area, the appropriate CLEO 
was identified.  

(a) If cities within a participating county CLEO were acting as 
their own CLEO's, their populations were subtracted from the 
county population.  

(b) If a municipal CLEO was discovered to be providing services 
for other selected municipalities, then populations for those 
municipalities were added to the population of the city having the CLEO. 

(c) Those CLEO's selected to participate in the study but found 
to be relying on other jurisdictions to conduct background checks  
were replaced by those other jurisdictions (for example, a town 
being replaced by a county).

(8) Maine has local CLEO's; however, Maine's data came from the 
State police that serve 40% of the State's population.  The State 
police data were split into A and B categories based on the 
proportion of the Maine population in each category.

(9) Connecticut did not submit any data in time for this study.  
Connecticut has both local and State CLEO's, but for the purposes 
of this study, Connecticut was classified as a State CLEO.

(10) National estimates exclude the District of Columbia and U.S. 
territories.  Sales of firearms are prohibited in the District of 
Columbia except to law enforcement officers.
