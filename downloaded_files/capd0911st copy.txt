Crime Against Persons with Disabilities 2009–2011

Erika Harrell, Ph.D., BJS Statistician

December 2012, NCJ 240299

Persons age 12 or older who had disabilities experienced an 
annual average of about 923,000 nonfatal violent crimes 
during a 2-year period from 2010 to 2011 (table 1). Nonfatal 
violent crimes include rape, sexual assault, robbery, 
aggravated assault, and simple assault. No statistically 
significant difference was found in the average annual number 
of nonfatal violent victimizations against persons with 
disabilities from 2010 to 2011.

The findings in this report are based on the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey 
(NCVS), a household survey that collects data on U.S. 
residents age 12 or older (excluding those living in 
institutions). The NCVS defines disability as a sensory, 
physical, mental, or emotional condition lasting 6 months or 
longer and causing difficulty in activities of daily living. 
Disabilities are classified according to six limitations: 
hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, and 
independent living.

The NCVS adopted survey questions from the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) to identify 
respondents with disabilities. Data from the ACS and the 2000 
U.S. Standard Population from the Decennial Census were used 
to estimate age-adjusted victimization rates for persons with 
and without disabilities. For this report, victimization 
rates were generated by using the ACS population estimates 
for persons with disabilities. The Methodology further 
details data sources, computation procedures, and data 
limitations.

Statistical tables in this report detail the level and rates 
of nonfatal violent victimization against persons with and 
without disabilities, describe the types of disabilities, and 
compare victim characteristics. Estimates are based on 2-year 
rolling averages centered on the most recent year. For 
example, estimates reported for 2009 represent the average 
estimates for 2008 and 2009. This method improves the 
reliability and stability of estimate comparisons over time.

********************************
Violent crime by victim’s age 
and disability status
********************************

* Among persons ages 12 to 15, the average annual unadjusted 
rate of violent victimization was higher for persons with 
disabilities (76 per 1,000) than for persons without 
disabilities (30 per 1,000) in 2011 (table 2).

* Among persons ages 16 to 19, persons with disabilities had 
an average annual unadjusted rate of violent victimization 
(123 per 1,000) that was at least three times greater than 
that of persons without disabilities (37 per 1,000) in 2011. 

* From 2009 to 2011, the average annual unadjusted rate of 
violent victimization among persons ages 16 to 19 with 
disabilities increased from 77 per 1,000 to 123 per 1,000.

* The average annual unadjusted rate of violent victimization 
among persons with disabilities ages 20 to 24 slightly 
increased from 74 per 1,000 in 2010 to 110 per 1,000 in 2011.

* The average annual unadjusted rate of violent victimization 
against persons with disabilities age 65 or older slightly 
increased from 2010 (3 per 1,000) to 2011 
(5 per 1,000).

******************************************************
******************************
The use of age-adjusted rates
******************************

Direct comparisons of the violent victimization rate
between persons with and without disabilities without
taking into account the differences in age distributions
between the two populations can be misleading. The age
distribution of persons with disabilities differs 
considerablyfrom that of persons without disabilities, 
and violent crime victimization rates vary significantly 
with age. To compare rates of violent victimization by 
disability status, an age adjustment method was used to 
handle the differences in age distributions of persons  
with disabilities and without disabilities. According 
to the ACS, persons with disabilities are generally 
older than persons without disabilities. For example, 
about 41% of persons with disabilities were
age 65 or older in 2010, compared to 11% of persons
without disabilities. The age adjustment standardizes
the rate of violence for persons with disabilities to show
what the rate against them would be if they had the same
age distribution as the 2000 U.S. Standard Population as
calculated by the U.S. Census Bureau.
******************************************************

*******************************
Violent crime by type of crime
*******************************

* The average annual age-adjusted rate of violent 
victimization for persons with disabilities (48 per 1,000 
persons with disabilities) was more than twice the rate among 
persons without disabilities (19 per 1,000 persons without 
disabilities) in 2011 (table 3 and table 4).

* In 2011, the average annual age-adjusted rate of serious 
violent victimization for persons with disabilities (22 per 
1,000) was more than three times higher than that for persons 
without disabilities (6 per 1,000).

* During 2011, serious violence (rape/sexual assault, 
robbery, and aggravated assault) accounted for about 43% of 
nonfatal violent crime against persons with disabilities, 
which was higher than the percentage found for persons 
without disabilities (31%) (not shown in table).

* In 2011, the age-adjusted average annual rate of simple 
assault against persons with disabilities (26 per 1,000) was 
twice that for persons without disabilities (13 per 1,000).

* No statistically significant difference was found in the 
average annual rates of violent victimization against persons 
with disabilities from 2009 to 2011.

* Among persons without disabilities, the rate of violent 
victimization declined from 2009 (22 per 1,000) to 2010 (20 
per 1,000). No statistically significant difference was found 
in the average annual age-adjusted rates of violent 
victimization for persons without disabilities in the 2010 
(20 per 1,000) and 2011 (19 per 1,000).

* For both persons with and without disabilities, the average 
annual age-adjusted rate of simple assault declined from 2009 
to 2010 and remained stable in 2011. 

* Among persons with and without disabilities, aggravated 
assault remained stable from 2009 to 2011.

******************************
Violent crime rates by sex, 
race, and Hispanic origin
Sex
******************************

* In 2011, the average annual age-adjusted rate of violent 
victimization was greater for persons with disabilities than 
for those without disabilities for both males and females 
(table 5). 

* The rate of violence for males with disabilities was 42 per 
1,000 in 2011, compared to 22 per 1,000 for males without 
disabilities. 

* For females with disabilities, the rate of violence was 53 
per 1,000 in 2011, compared to 17 per 1,000 for females 
without disabilities.

* Among persons with disabilities, no statistically 
significant difference was found in the average annual age-
adjusted rate of violent victimization for males and females 
in 2011. 

Race and Hispanic origin
**************************

* For each racial group measured, persons with disabilities 
had higher average annual age-adjusted violent victimization 
rates than persons without disabilities in 2011. 

* For each of the racial groups examined, no statistically 
significant difference was found among persons with 
disabilities in the average annual age-adjusted rates of 
violent victimization for 2009 and 2011.

* In 2011, there was no statistically significant difference 
in the average annual age-adjusted rates of violent 
victimization for whites with disabilities (52 per 1,000) and 
blacks with disabilities (37 per 1,000).

* Persons of other races (including American Indians/Alaska 
Natives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders) (26 per 1,000) had a 
lower average annual rate of violent victimization than 
whites (52 per 1,000) and persons of two or more races (78 
per 1,000) in 2011.

* Among persons with and without disabilities, Hispanics had 
a lower average annual rate of violent victimization than 
non-Hispanics in 2011.

* Among Hispanics, persons with disabilities (33 per 1,000) 
had a higher average annual rate of violent victimization in 
2010 than persons without disabilities (16 per 1,000). The 
same was true among non-Hispanics (51 per 1,000 persons with 
disabilities compared to 20 per 1,000 persons without 
disabilities).

******************************
Violent crime by number 
of disability types
******************************
 
* In 2011, an average annual 57% of nonfatal violent crime 
against persons with disabilities involved victims who had 
multiple disability types (hearing, vision, cognitive, 
ambulatory, self-care, independent living). While this was 
not statistically different from the percentage found in 2010 
(51%), it was an increase from the percentage found in 2009 
(41%) (table 6).

* From 2009 to 2011, the average annual percentage of violent 
victimization against persons with disabilities in which the 
victim had multiple disability types increased for 
rape/sexual assault, robbery, and simple assault.

* Persons with a single disability type (38 per 1,000) had a 
lower violent victimization rate than persons with more than 
one disability type (61 per 1,000) in 2011 (table 7).

* In 2011, the average annual age-adjusted rate of serious 
violent victimization against persons with one disability 
type was 16 per 1,000, compared to 30 per 1,000 among persons 
with multiple disability types.

* The average annual age-adjusted rate of violent crime 
against persons with a single disability type decreased from 
53 per 1,000 in 2009 to 38 per 1,000 in 2011. Among persons 
with multiple disability types, the rate increased from 43 
per 1,000 in 2009 to 61 per 1,000 in 2011.

**********************
Types of disability 
**********************

* Persons with cognitive disabilities had the highest average 
annual unadjusted rate of violent victimization from 2009 to 
2011 (table 8).

* Among persons with cognitive disabilities, the average 
annual rate of serious violent victimization increased across 
the study period from 12 per 1,000 in 2009 to 24 per 1,000 in 
2011 (table 9).

* The average annual rate of serious violent victimization 
against persons with self-care disabilities increased from 
2009 (4 per 1,000) to 2011 (13 per 1,000).

* The average annual unadjusted rate of simple assault 
against persons with cognitive disabilities slightly declined 
from 2009 (34 per 1,000) to 2010 (26 per 1,000), then 
remained stable through 2011 (table 10).

* In 2011, with the exception of self-care, no differences 
were detected in the unadjusted rates of violent 
victimization by victim’s sex and disability type (table 11).
* Males with self-care disabilities (34 per 1,000) had a 
slightly higher rate of violent victimization than females 
with self-care disabilities (23 per 1,000) in 2011.

********************************
Among males with disabilities—
********************************

* From 2009 to 2010, no change was detected in the average 
annual unadjusted rate of violent victimization against males 
with any disability type.  

* From 2010 to 2011, the average annual unadjusted rate of 
violent victimization against males with hearing, cognitive, 
and self-care disabilities slightly increased.

*********************************
Among females with disabilities—
*********************************

* The average annual unadjusted rate of violent victimization 
against females with hearing disabilities decreased from 27 
per 1,000 in 2009 to 11 per 1,000 in 2010. There was no 
statistically significant difference in the average annual 
rates of violent victimization against females with hearing 
disabilities from 2010 to 2011.

* From 2010 to 2011, no statistically significant difference 
was found in the average annual unadjusted rates of violent 
victimization against females with vision, ambulatory, 
cognitive, self-care, and independent living disabilities.

Methodology

Survey coverage
******************

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an annual 
data collection conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The NCVS is a self-report 
survey in which interviewed persons are asked about the 
number and characteristics of victimizations experienced 
during the prior 6 months. The NCVS collects information on 
nonfatal personal crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery, 
aggravated and simple assault, and personal larceny) and 
household property crimes (burglary, motor vehicle theft, and 
other theft) both reported and not reported to police. In 
addition to providing annual level and change estimates on 
criminal victimization, the NCVS is the primary source of 
information on the nature of criminal victimization 
incidents. Survey respondents provide information about 
themselves (such as age, sex, race and ethnicity, marital 
status, education level, and income) and if they experienced 
a victimization. For crime victims, information about the 
offender (such as age, race and ethnicity, sex, and victim-
offender relationship), characteristics of the crime 
(including time and place of occurrence, use of weapons, 
nature of injury, and economic consequences), whether the 
crime was reported to police, reasons why the crime was or 
was not reported, and experiences with the criminal justice 
system are collected about each victimization incident.

The NCVS is administered to persons age 12 or older from a 
nationally representative sample of households in the United 
States. Once selected, households remain in the sample for 3 
years, and eligible persons in these households are 
interviewed every 6 months for a total of seven interviews. 
New households rotate into the sample on an ongoing basis to 
replace outgoing households that have been in sample for the 
3-year period. The sample includes persons living in group 
quarters, such as dormitories, rooming houses, and religious 
group dwellings, and excludes persons living in military 
barracks and institutional settings, such as correctional or 
hospital facilities, and the homeless. (For more detail, see 
the Survey Methodology for Criminal Victimization in the 
United States, 2007, NCJ 227669, BJS web, March 2010.) 

In 2011, about 143,000 persons age 12 or older from about 
79,800 households across the country were interviewed during 
the year. From 2008 to 2011—the primary reference period for 
this report—a total of 561,000 persons from about 315,000 
households were interviewed. This equates to an annual 
average of about 140,000 persons age 12 or older in 
households interviewed each year from 2008 to 2011.

The NCVS adopted questions from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 
American Community Survey (ACS) to measure the rate of 
victimization against people with disabilities. The NCVS does 
not identify persons in the general populations with 
disabilities. The ACS Subcommittee on Disability Questions 
developed the disability questions based on questions used in 
the 2000 Decennial Census and earlier versions of the ACS. 
The questions identify persons who may require assistance to 
maintain their independence, be at risk for discrimination, 
or lack opportunities available to the general population 
because of limitations related to a prolonged (6 months or 
longer) sensory, physical, mental, or emotional condition. 
More information about the ACS and the disability questions 
is available on the U.S. Census Bureau website at 
http://www.census.gov/acs/www/. 

***************************************
Changes to the disability questions on 
the NCVS and ACS in 2008
***************************************

In 2008, the U.S. Census Bureau changed some of the 
disability questions on the ACS. The question about sensory 
disability was separated into two questions about blindness 
and deafness, and the questions about physical disability 
were asked only about serious difficulty walking or climbing 
stairs. Also, questions on employment disability and going 
outside of the home were eliminated in 2008. Census Bureau 
analysis of 2007 and 2008 ACS disability data revealed 
significant conceptual and measurement differences between 
the 2007 and 2008 disability questions. The Census Bureau 
concluded that data users should not compare the 2007 
estimates of the population with disabilities and those of 
later years. Because the 2007 and 2008 NCVS disability 
questions mirrored the ACS, estimates of victimization of 
people with disabilities from the 2007 and 2008 NCVS should 
not be compared. As a result, the 2007 disability data are 
not presented in this report. Further explanation about 
incomparability of the 2007 and 2008 ACS disability data is 
available at 
http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/disability/2008ACS_disability.
pdf.

********************************
Definitions of disability types
********************************

Disabilities are classified according to six limitations: 
hearing, vision, cognitive, ambulatory, self-care, 
independent living.

* Hearing limitation entails deafness or serious difficulty 
hearing.

* Vision limitation is blindness or serious difficulty 
seeing, even when wearing glasses.

* Cognitive limitation includes serious difficulty in 
concentrating, remembering, or making decisions because of a 
physical, mental, or emotional condition.

* Ambulatory limitation is difficulty walking or climbing 
stairs.

* Self-care limitation is a condition that causes difficulty 
dressing or bathing.

* Independent living limitation is a physical, mental, or 
emotional condition that impedes doing errands alone, such as 
visiting a doctor or shopping.

********************************
Disability questions included in 
the NCVS from 2008 through 2011
********************************

Questions 169a through 173
***************************

169a. Are you deaf or do you have serious difficulty hearing?

169b. Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing 
even when wearing glasses?
170a. Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, 
do you have serious difficulty:

* concentrating, remembering, or making decisions?

* walking or climbing stairs?

* dressing or bathing?

170b. Because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition, 
do you have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a 
doctor’s office or shopping?

171. Is “Yes” marked in any of 169a–170b? (That is, has the 
respondent indicated that he/she has a health condition or 
disability?)

172. During the incident you just told me about, do you have 
reason to suspect you were victimized because of your health 
condition(s), impairment(s), or disability(ies)?

173. What health conditions, impairments, or disabilities do 
you believe caused you to be targeted for this incident?
In the ACS, persons ages 12 to 14 are not asked about 
independent living and are therefore not included in the 
populations with independent living disabilities. Even though 
crime victims ages 12 to 14 receive this question in the NCVS 
(question 170b), victims ages 12 to 14 who respond 
affirmatively are excluded from rates of violent 
victimization against persons with an independent living 
disability in order to match the age limitations for having 
an independent living disability in the ACS (age 15 or 
older). In this report, rates of violence against persons 
with an independent living disability are per 1,000 persons 
age 15 or older, compared to rates per 1,000 persons ages 12 
or older for other disability types. Also, violent crime 
victims ages 12 to 14 who report in the NCVS that they have 
an independent living disability and no other disability are 
classified as not having a disability to be compatible with 
age limits on disability definitions in the ACS.

*******************************
Limitations of the estimates
*******************************

The NCVS was designed to measure the incidence of criminal 
victimization against the U.S. civilian household population, 
excluding persons who live in institutions and the homeless. 
In this report, institutions refer to adult correctional 
facilities, juvenile facilities, nursing facilities or 
skilled nursing facilities, in-patient hospice facilities, 
residential schools for people with disabilities, and 
hospitals with patients who have no usual home elsewhere as 
defined by the ACS. The measures of crime against persons 
with disabilities (as measured by the NCVS and ACS) cover 
only people with disabilities who are living among the 
general population in household settings. Subsequently, there 
is some coverage error in using just the noninstitutionalized 
population. For example, according to the ACS, about 96% of 
1.3 million persons age 65 or older living in institutions 
had disabilities in 2010. Because persons in these facilities 
would not be covered in the NCVS, estimates of violence 
against these persons are not counted. This lack of 
information from the institutions will result in an 
undercount of violence against persons with disabilities.

Certain aspects of the NCVS design can also contribute to an 
underestimation of the level or type of violence against 
persons with disabilities. For example, the survey 
instruments, modes of interview, and interviewing protocols 
used in the NCVS may not be suited for interviewing people 
with difficulty communicating, especially by telephone. 
Currently, about 55% of the interviews conducted for the NCVS 
are by telephone. Some people have disabilities that limit 
their verbal communication and use technology to enhance 
their ability to communicate, but many people do not have 
access to such technology.

Proxy interviews may also lead to an underestimate of 
violence against persons with disabilities. The survey 
requires direct interviews with eligible respondents and 
allows the use of proxy interviews with a caregiver or other 
eligible party in a limited set of circumstances. A proxy 
interview is allowed when a respondent is physically or 
mentally incapable of responding. The survey restrictions on 
proxy interviews were instituted because someone else may not 
know about the victimization experiences of the respondent, 
and because the person providing the information via proxy 
may be the perpetrator of the abuse or violence experienced 
by the respondent. Since proxy respondents may be more likely 
to omit crime incidents or may not know some details about 
reported crime incidents, the number or types of crimes 
against persons with disabilities may be underestimated. In 
2011, about 5% of violent crime incidents against persons 
with disabilities were obtained from proxy interviews. In 
addition, in 2011, all of the violent incidents against 
persons with disabilities conducted by proxy interviews were 
for simple assault, compared to about 57% of violent 
incidents against persons with disabilities conducted from 
nonproxy interviews (not shown in table).

**************************
Disability population in 
the United States
**************************

According to the ACS, about 14% of the U.S. population age 12 
or older living outside of institutions in 2010 had a 
disability. Characteristics of the population with and 
without disabilities are compared in appendix table 11. Among 
noninstitutionalized persons with disabilities, 47% were male 
and 53% were female. Whites accounted for about 78% of the 
population with disabilities, blacks 14%, and persons of two 
or more races 2%. About 11% were Hispanic. About 70% of the 
population with disabilities was age 50 or older, compared to 
about 33% in the population of persons without disabilities. 
The sex, race, Hispanic origin, and age distributions of 
persons with a disability living outside of institutions did 
not change substantially between 2009 and 2010. The 2011 
population estimates for persons with disabilities were based 
on the 2010 population distributions (see below).

***********************************
Comparing 2010 computed populations 
and 2010 ACS populations 
***********************************

For this report BJS calculated 2010 age-adjusted and 
unadjusted rates of violent victimization by disability 
status and other demographics. BJS used population estimates 
that were computed using 2009 proportions of the populations 
by disability status from the American Community Survey 
(ACS). BJS did this because the 2010 populations by 
disability status were not available from the ACS. However, 
2010 populations by disability status and other demographic 
characteristics were available from the 2010 ACS. BJS 
compared the two 2010 populations (calculated from 
proportions of demographic information in the 2009 ACS and 
actual estimates from the 2010 ACS) (appendix table 12). Even 
though the calculated counts differ from the ACS counts for 
each demographic group within both disability statuses, no 
systematic differences were detected between the calculated 
populations and the 2010 ACS populations. As a result, a 
decision was made to continue this practice for the 2011 
rates.

***********************************
Computation of 2011 populations 
by disability status
***********************************

Data from 2011 were available from the NCVS but not the ACS 
for this report. Therefore, another method was used to 
generate populations used to calculate estimates of 2011 
rates by disability status. First, the total resident 
noninstitutionalized U.S. population age 12 or older for 2011 
was generated from the NCVS. Next, the proportions of the 
2010 overall population by disability status and by 
demographic groups within each disability status were 
calculated from the ACS. These proportions were then applied 
to the overall 2011 population from the NCVS to generate 2011 
populations by disability status. The 2011 rates were then 
calculated using the same method used to calculate the 2008, 
2009, and 2010 rates, using numerators from the 2011 NCVS and 
the 2011 populations generated using proportions of the 2010 
ACS population.

***********************************

The method used to generate age-adjusted rates of violent 
victimization presented in this report was direct 
standardization with the 2000 U.S. Standard Population from 
the Decennial Census as the standard population. Age-adjusted 
standardization eliminates the problem of different age 
distributions between and within groups. In general, persons 
with disabilities are an older population than persons 
without disabilities. Since crime rates vary by age, direct 
standardization produces age-adjusted rates that would occur 
if both populations had the same age distribution as the 
standard population. 

The 2000 U.S. Standard Population was created by the U.S. 
Census Bureau Population Projection Program 
(www.census.gov/population/www/projections/index.html), which 
uses data from the Current Population Survey. To calculate 
age groups using the 2000 U.S. Standard Population, 
populations of single years of age were obtained for persons 
age 12 or older from the Census P25–1130 
(www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1130/) series estimates of the 
2000 populations generated by the U. S. Census Bureau 
Population Projection Program. These single-year populations 
for persons age 12 or older were then summed to create the 
following age groups: ages 12 to 15, 16 to 19, 20 to 24, 25 
to 34, 35 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 or older. In this report, 
the total standard population refers to the 2000 U.S. 
Standard Population age 12 or older. All weights created for 
this report based on the 2000 U.S. Standard Population are 
not race-or sex-specific, so they do not adjust for 
differences in the racial or sex distributions between 
populations of persons with and without disabilities. 

There is little difference in the race and sex distributions 
between populations of persons with and without disabilities.  
According to the 2010 ACS, among noninstitutionalized persons 
with disabilities, about 47% were male and 53% were female, 
compared to 49% of persons without disabilities being male 
and 51% being female. Whites accounted for 78% of persons 
with disabilities and 75% of persons without disabilities. 
Blacks accounted for about 14% of persons with disabilities 
and about 12% of persons without disabilities. Persons of 
other racial groups accounted for about 7% of persons with 
disabilities and about 11% of persons without disabilities. 
Persons of two or more races made up the same percentage 
(about 2%) of the population with and without disabilities. 
Hispanics accounted for about 11% of persons with 
disabilities and about 16% of persons without disabilities in 
2010. Non-Hispanics accounted for about 89% of persons with 
disabilities and about 84% of persons without disabilities.

The violent victimization rate, age-adjusted using direct 
standardization with the 2000 U.S. Standard Population as the 
standard population (Rd), is calculated as-

Rd = ? (wa * ra)
where

Rd = age-adjusted rate of violent victimization of the 
population of interest calculated using direct 
standardization 

wa = weight calculated from the 2000 U.S. Standard Population 
for age group a

ra = unadjusted rate of violent victimization for age group 
a.

The weight (wa) for age group a is calculated as--

wa = na / N

where

wa = weight calculated from the 2000 U.S. Standard Population 
for age group a

na = number of persons in age group a in the 2000 U.S. 

Standard Population
N = total number of persons in the 2000 U.S. Standard 

***********
Population
***********

This method produces rates of violent victimization as if the 
population of interest had the same age distribution as the 
2000 U.S. Standard Population. To use this method to produce 
age-adjusted rates of violent victimization for persons with 
disabilities, ra would represent the unadjusted violent 
victimization rate against persons with disabilities in age 
group a. To calculate the violent victimization rate of 
persons without disabilities, ra would represent the 
unadjusted violent victimization rate against persons without 
disabilities in age group a.

Property crime
***************

In the first two reports in this series, Crime Against People 
with Disabilities, 2007, BJS web, NCJ 227814, October 2009, 
and Crime Against People with Disabilities, 2008, BJS web, 
NCJ 231328, December 2010, property crime by disability 
status was included. These statistics are not included in 
this report due to potential underreporting of property 
crimes against persons with disabilities. The NCVS measure of 
property crime is a household-based measure. The questions 
NCVS uses to identify whether a person has a disability are 
asked only of those respondents who reported that they have 
been victimized. If the person who reports the property crime 
is a household member with a disability, then the NCVS 
identifies the property crime as one against a household that 
has a person with a disability. If a household member without 
a disability reports the property crime during the survey, 
the NCVS does not ask whether any other household member has 
a disability. For this reason, any estimate of property crime 
against people with disabilities using the NCVS may be an 
undercount of such crimes. As a result, information regarding 
property crime is not included in this report.

**************************
Nonresponse and weighting 
adjustments
**************************

The 79,800 households that participated in the NCVS in 2011 
represent a 90% household response rate. The person-level 
response rate--the percentage of persons age 12 or older in 
participating households who completed an NCVS interview—was 
88% in 2011. 

Estimates in this report use data from the 2008 to 2011 NCVS 
data files weighted to produce annual estimates for persons 
age 12 or older living in U.S. households. Because the NCVS 
relies on a sample rather than a census of the entire U.S. 
population, weights are designed to inflate sample point 
estimates to known population totals and to compensate for 
survey nonresponse and other aspects of the sample design.

The NCVS data files include both household and person 
weights. The household weight is commonly used to calculate 
estimates of property crimes, such as motor vehicle theft or 
burglary, which are identified with the household. Person 
weights provide an estimate of the population represented by 
each person in the sample. Person weights are most frequently 
used to compute estimates of crime victimizations of persons 
in the total population. After proper adjustment, both 
household and person weights are also used to form the 
denominator in calculations of crime rates.

The victimization weights used in this analysis account for 
the number of persons present during an incident and for 
repeat victims of series incidents. The weight counts series 
incidents as the actual number of incidents reported by the 
victim, up to a maximum of ten incidents. Series 
victimizations are victimizations that are similar in type 
but occur with such frequency that a victim is unable to 
recall each individual event or to describe each event in 
detail. Survey procedures allow NCVS interviewers to identify 
and classify these similar victimizations as series 
victimizations and collect detailed information on only the 
most recent incident in the series. In 2010 and 2011, about 
3% of all victimizations were series incidents. The approach 
to weighting series incidents as the number of incidents up 
to a maximum of ten produces more reliable estimates of crime 
levels, while the cap at 10 minimizes the effect of extreme 
outliers on the rates. Additional information on the series 
enumeration is detailed in the report Methods for Counting 
High Frequency Repeat Victimizations in the National Crime 
Victimization Survey, NCJ 237308, BJS web, April 2012.  
For this report, prior to applying the weights to the data, 
all victimizations that occurred outside of the U.S. were 
excluded. From 2008 to 2011, about 30 of the approximately 
5,100 total unweighted violent victimizations occurred 
outside of the U.S. and were excluded from the analyses.

***********************************
Standard error computations for 
percentages and unadjusted rates
***********************************

When national estimates are derived from a sample, as is the 
case with the NCVS, caution must be taken when comparing one 
estimate to another or when comparing estimates over time. 
Although one estimate may be larger than another, estimates 
based on a sample have some degree of sampling error. The 
sampling error of an estimate depends on several factors, 
including the amount of variation in the responses, the size 
of the sample, and the size of the subgroup for which the 
estimate is computed. When the sampling error around the 
estimates is taken into consideration, the estimates that 
appear different may, in fact, not be statistically 
different.

One measure of the sampling error associated with an estimate 
is the standard error. The standard error can vary from one 
estimate to the next. In general, for a given metric, an 
estimate with a smaller standard error provides a more 
reliable approximation of the true value than an estimate 
with a larger standard error. Estimates with relatively large 
standard errors are associated with less precision and 
reliability and should be interpreted with caution.

In order to generate standard errors around numbers and 
estimates from the NCVS, the Census Bureau produces 
generalized variance function (GVF) parameters for BJS. The 
GVFs take into account aspects of the NCVS complex sample 
design and represent the curve fitted to a selection of 
individual standard errors based on the Jackknife Repeated 
Replication technique. The GVF parameters were used to 
generate standard errors for each point estimate (such as 
counts, percentages, and rates) in the report. For average 
annual estimates, standard errors were based on the ratio of 
the sums of victimizations and respondents across years.

In this report, BJS conducted tests to determine whether 
differences in estimated numbers and percentages were 
statistically significant once sampling error was taken into 
account. Using statistical programs developed specifically 
for the NCVS, we tested the significance of all comparisons 
in the text. The primary test procedure used was Student’s t-
statistic, which tests the difference between two sample 
estimates. To ensure that the observed differences between 
estimates were larger than might be expected due to sampling 
variation, we set the significance level at the 95% 
confidence level.
 
Data users can use the estimates and the standard errors of 
the estimates provided in this report to generate a 
confidence interval around the estimate as a measure of the 
margin of error. The following example illustrates how 
standard errors can be used to generate confidence intervals:

According to the NCVS, during 2010 and 2011, 56.9% of violent 
crime against persons with disabilities involved victims with 
multiple disability types (see table 6). Using the GVFs, BJS 
determined that the estimate has a standard error of 2.5% 
(see appendix table 5). A confidence interval around the 
estimate was generated by multiplying the standard errors by 
±1.96 (the t-score of a normal, two-tailed distribution that 
excludes 2.5% at either end of the distribution). Therefore, 
the confidence interval around the 56.9% estimate from 2011 
is 56.9% ± 2.5% x 1.96 or (52.0% to 61.8%). In others words, 
if different samples using the same procedures were taken 
from the U.S. population during 2010 and 2011, 95% of the 
time the percentage of violent crimes against persons with 
disabilities in which the victim had multiple disability 
types would fall between 52.0% and 61.8%. 

In this report, a coefficient of variation (CV), representing 
the ratio of the standard error to the estimate, was also 
calculated for all estimates. CVs provide a measure of 
reliability and a means to compare the precision of estimates 
across measures with differing levels or metrics. In cases 
where the CV was greater than 50%, or the unweighted sample 
had 10 or fewer cases, the estimate was noted with a “!” 
symbol (interpret data with caution; estimate based on 10 or 
fewer sample cases, or coefficient of variation exceeds 50%).

************************************

Due to the complexity in generating age-adjusted rates of 
violent crime, other methods were used to compute standard 
errors and determine statistical significance. For each age-
adjusted rate, variances were computed for each age group-
specific rate using information from the generalized variance 
function (GVF) parameters that the Census Bureau produced for 
the NCVS. For each age group, the variance was multiplied by 
the squared weight for that particular age group in the 2000 
U.S. Standard Population. The result was then summed across 
all age groups to produce the variance for the age-adjusted 
rate. The square root was taken of this variance to produce 
the standard error of the age-adjusted rate. To calculate 
statistical significance among age-adjusted rates, the 
standard errors were computed for each age-adjusted rate. 
Next, confidence intervals were generated using these 
standard errors with the following formula 
(Rd ± 1.96 * sd), in which Rd represents the age-adjusted 
rate and sd represents the standard error of Rd. If the 
confidence intervals of two age-adjusted rates did not 
overlap, the difference was considered statistically 
significant at the .05 level. If the confidence intervals of 
two age-adjusted rates did overlap, the difference was 
considered to be not statistically significant at the .05 
level.

Crime Victims with Disabilities
Awareness Act (Public Law 105-301),
1998
************************************

The Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act mandates
that the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) include
statistics on crimes against people with disabilities and the
characteristics of these victims. The act was designed “to
increase public awareness of the plight of victims of crime
with developmental disabilities, to collect data to measure
the magnitude of the problem, and to develop strategies to
address the safety and justice needs of victims of crime with
developmental disabilities.” Section 5 of the act directed
the Department of Justice to include statistics relating to
“the nature of crimes against people with developmental
disabilities; and the specific characteristics of the victims
of those crimes” in the NCVS. This report is a part of the
Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) series on crime against
people with disabilities. More information can be found on
the BJS website. Because of changes in the questionnaire,
comparisons between 2007 data and later years should
not be made. (See Methodology for more information on
changes to the NCVS and ACS questionnaires.)
