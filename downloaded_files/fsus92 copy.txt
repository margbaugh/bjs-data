Felony Sentences in the United States, 1992
NCJ-151167

--------------
Highlights
--------------


*State courts convicted 893,600 adults of a felony in 1992.

*From 1988 to 1992 the volume of felony convictions rose 34%. 
Convictions rose the most for aggravated assault (up 57%) and
drug trafficking (up 53%).

*The growth in convictions outpaced that in adult arrests. 
Despite the relatively large increase in convictions, processing
was not slower in 1992 than in 1988. In both years average
elapsed time from arrest to sentencing was around 7 months.

*The proportions of felons sentenced to incarceration or
probation in 1992 were generally unchanged from 1988.  Prison
sentences accounted for 44% of felony sentences in both years. 

*Drug traffickers (19%) and drug possessors (12%) together made
up 31% of felons convicted in State courts in 1992.  Violent
offenders--consisting of murderers (1%), rapists (2%), robbers
(6%), assaulters (7%), and others convicted of a violent crime
(2%)--made up 18%.  Burglars (13%) and larcenists (13%) made up
most of the rest.

*State courts sentenced 44% of convicted felons to a State
prison, 26% to a local jail, and 30% to straight probation with
no jail or prison time to serve.

*State courts sentenced to death 2% of those convicted of murder.

*Felons sentenced to a State prison in 1992 had an average
sentence of 6« years but were likely to serve roughly a third of
that sentence--or about 2« years--before release, assuming that
current release policies continued.

*The average sentence to local jail was 7 months.  The average
probation sentence was about 4 years. In addition, a fine was
imposed on 18% of convicted felons, restitution on 16%,
community service on 6%, and treatment was ordered for 7%.

*Of the total number of convicted felons in 1992, 92% had
pleaded guilty to their crime.  The remaining 8% had been found
guilty at trial.

*Nationally, of the felons convicted in 1992, 52% were white,
47% were black, and 1% were of other races.

Felony Sentences in the United States, 1992
----------------------------------------------

By Patrick A. Langan, Ph.D.
and Helen A. Graziadei

In 1992 State courts convicted nearly 900,000 adults of a
felony. Forty-four percent of convicted felons were sentenced to
a State prison, and 26% were sentenced to a local jail (usually
for a year or less).  The remaining 30% were sentenced to
straight probation with no jail or prison time to serve.  These
findings come from a survey that is done every 2 years and that
provides the only detailed description of the sentences felons
receive in State courts nationwide.

------------------------------------
National Judicial Reporting Program
------------------------------------

The National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP) compiles detailed
information on the sentences and characteristics of convicted
felons.  Previous surveys of felony sentencing in State courts
were conducted in 1986, 1988, and 1990.  (See Felony Sentences
in State Courts, 1986, NCJ-115210, February 1989; Felony
Sentences in State Courts, 1988, NCJ-126923, December 1990; and
Felony Sentences in State Courts, 1990, NCJ-140186, March 1993.)

The 1992 survey was based on a  sample of 300 counties selected
to be nationally representative. All but 1 of the 300 were in
the 1988 and 1990 surveys.  The 300 include the District of
Columbia and at least 1 county from every State except, by
chance, Vermont. Among the 300 sampled counties, 2 sentenced no
felons during 1992.  The 1992 survey excluded Federal courts and
those State or local courts that did not adjudicate adult felony
cases. 

Federal courts convicted 41,673 persons of a felony in 1992.(In
1992 the State court in one county, Los Angeles, accounted for
nearly 44,000 felony convictions, more than in all the Nation's
Federal courts combined.

Source of Federal statistics: Federal Justice Statistics
Program, unpublished 1992 data). That number represents 4% of
the combined State and Federal total number of felony
convictions during 1992.  The 1992 survey included only offenses
that State penal codes defined as felonies.  Felonies are widely
defined as crimes that have the potential of being punished by
more than 1 year in prison.

------------------------------
Felony conviction offenses
------------------------------

A total of 893,600 persons were convicted of a felony in State
courts in 1992, including 165,000 (or 18% of the total) for a
violent felony; 297,000 (34%) for the property offenses of
burglary, larceny, fraud, and forgery; 280,000 (31%) for drug
offenses; and 26,000 (3%) for weapons offenses. The remaining
124,000 (14%) consisted of persons convicted of nonviolent
offenses such as receiving stolen property and escaping custody.
 Marijuana trafficking convictions were 2% of the conviction
total, and marijuana possession convictions were less than 1% of
the total.

----------------------------
Sentences for felonies
----------------------------

In 1992, 70% of all convicted felons were sentenced to a period
of confinement--44% to State prisons and 26% to local jails. 
The difference between prison and jail sentences is that jail
sentences are for short-term confinement (usually for a year or
less) in a county or city facility, while prison sentences are
for long-term confinement (usually for over a year) in a State
facility.                

An estimated 30% of all convicted felons were sentenced to
straight probation with no jail or prison time to serve.

---------------------
Sentence length
---------------------

An offender convicted of multiple offenses receives a sentence
for each offense.  If multiple prison sentences are imposed, the
court then decides whether the convicted felon will serve the
sentences concurrently (at the same time) or consecutively (one
after another).  For persons with consecutive sentences, the
total time is the sum of the sentence lengths, and for persons
with concurrent sentences, the total time is the same as the
longest sentence.  For persons convicted of a single offense,
the total time refers simply to the sentence for that offense. 
Whenever an offender received a prison sentence range, such as 5
to 10 years, the total time refers to the maximum.

For the Nation in 1992,  the mean felony sentence to
incarceration (prison or jail) was 4 years and 5 months; the
median was 2 years.

---------------------
Prison sentences
---------------------

In 1992 the mean length of sentences to State prison was just
over 6« years; the median term was 4 years. The mean prison
sentence for murder and nonnegligent manslaughter was just under
21 years; the median was 24 years.

Among persons convicted of murder or nonnegligent manslaughter,
25% were sentenced to life in prison, and 1.6% were sentenced to
death.  Among those convicted of murder specifically (not
including nonnegligent manslaughter), 34% were sentenced to
life, and 2.2% were sentenced to death.(Not all persons
convicted of murder were subject to the death penalty. 
Thirty-six States authorized the death penalty in 1992.  Within
those 36, only certain types of murder were capital offenses.)

Life sentences as a percentage of all sentences in 1992 were--

                   Percent sentenced to life
                   in prison
                   ---------------

 All offenses             .7%
Murder                  25.0
Rape                     2.3

Other                     .1

--Less than 0.05%.

--------------------------------
Jail and probation sentences
--------------------------------

Among felons who received a sentence to local jail in 1992, the
mean sentence was 7 months, and the median was 5 months.
Probation sentences had a mean length of just under 4 years and
a median of 3 years.

---------------------------------------
Estimated prison time to be served 
---------------------------------------

The amount of time felons actually serve in prison is typically
a fraction of the total sentence received.

Two primary reasons explain the difference between sentences
received and time served: 

*In States that impose indeterminate sentences, a judge
specifies the minimum and/or maximum sentence length, but a
parole board decides when the prisoner will actually be released.

*In most but not all States, prisoners gain early release
through time credits that they receive automatically or that are
granted them for good behavior or special achievements --
provisions that are intended to help correctional officials to
manage institutional populations.

For both types of sentence reduction, released offenders usually
serve the remaining portion of their sentences under supervision
in the community. Based on data collected by BJS in its National
Corrections Reporting Program, inmates released from prisons in
27 States in 1992 had served an average of 38% of their total
sentence in prison. The percentage of sentence served ranged
from a high of 50% for those convicted of rape to a low of 27%
for those convicted of drug possession. Applying these
percentages to State prison sentences received in 1992, it is
estimated that felons sentenced in 1992 would serve about 2«
years, or 38% of their average 6«-year prison sentence.

-----------------------------------------------
Convicted felon populations: Sex, race, and age
-----------------------------------------------

In 1992 men comprised nearly 50% of the adult U.S. population
but 87% of persons convicted of a felony and 93% of persons
convicted of a violent felony.  Whites were 86% of the adult
U.S. population but 52% of persons convicted of a felony and 48%
of the persons convicted of a violent  felony.  Corresponding
figures for blacks were 11% of the adult U.S. population but 47%
of convicted felons and 50% of felons convicted of a violent
crime. The other races (American Indians, Alaska Natives,
Asians, and Pacific Islanders) represented 3% of  the U.S.
population but 1% of convicted felons and 2% of those convicted
of a violent crime.

Persons in their twenties represented about 24% of the adult
U.S. population but 46% of convicted felons.  The mean or
average age of felons was 30 years; the median was 28.

---------------------------------------------
Felony convictions and sentences relative to the numbers of
arrests, 1992
---------------------------------------------

Using data from the NJRP and  the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports
(UCR) on offenses and arrests, the number of felony convictions
in 1992 was compared with the number of crimes reported to
police for offenses likely to be felonies and the number of
arrests made for these crimes in 1992.  These numbers are
aggregates and should not be interpreted as representing the
disposition of  individual cases tracked across processing
stages of the criminal justice system.  In fact, a person
arrested for a specific offense may be convicted of a different
crime.  Nevertheless, the comparisons illustrate the approximate
odds of conviction and a prison sentence, given an arrest for a
felony.

For example, the FBI reports that in 1992 about 19,246 adults
were arrested for murder (including non-negligent manslaughter).
 NJRP data show that 12,548 persons were convicted of murder and
11,670 murderers received a prison sentence.  Together the data
show that for every 100 persons arrested for murder in the
United States in 1992, 65 were convicted of murder, and 61 were
sentenced to prison for that offense.  Corresponding figures for
drug traffickers were 55 convictions and 26 prison sentences for
every 100 arrests for drug trafficking.

--------------------------------------
Number of felony conviction offenses
-------------------------------------

At time of sentencing, the vast majority of felons sentenced in
1992 (79%) were sentenced for a single felony offense.  An
estimated 16% were sentenced for two felony offenses, and the
remaining 5% were sentenced for three or more.  The number of
offenses totals about 1.1 million felony conviction offenses for
which 893,600 felons were convicted and sentenced in 1992.

The greater the number of felony conviction offenses, the more
severe was the sentence.  The likelihood of a prison sentence
rose from 40% for those convicted of one felony, to 55% for two,
and to 59% for three or more.

The mean sentence to prison also increased from just under 6
years for those convicted of one felony to just over 8 years for
those convicted of two or more.

-----------------------------
Trends in the United States: 
1988 to 1992
-----------------------------

From 1988 to 1992 the volume of felony convictions rose 34%. 
The number of convictions for murder, rape, and robbery each
rose about 39%.  The greatest increases in the number of
convictions were for aggravated  assault (up 57%) and drug
trafficking (up 53%).

The number of convictions and prison sentences rose more than
that of adult arrests.  For example, regarding violent crime,
adult arrests went up 15%, but felony convictions rose 45% and
prison sentences rose 41%. (Trends from 1988 to 1992 for
specific offenses are in table.) 

Despite the relatively large increase in convictions, cases
generally took no longer in 1992 than in 1988.  In both years,
average elapsed time from arrest to sentencing was around 7
months.  There was no indication that to keep pace with the 1988
processing time courts disposed a larger percentage of 1992
cases by guilty plea.  In both years guilty pleas accounted for
about 92% of felony convictions.

The only demographic change identified over this period was in
the racial distribution of defendants.  Roughly corresponding to
changes in the racial distribution of persons arrested, the
number of black felons as a percentage of all persons convicted
rose from 41% in 1988 to 47% in 1992.

Sentencing patterns were generally unchanged except for drug
traffickers. Prison sentences overall accounted for 44% of
sentences in both 1988 and 1992.  The average prison sentence
was about 6«  years in 1992, not significantly different from
what it was in 1988.

The percentage of drug traffickers receiving a prison sentence
rose from 41% in 1988 to 48% in 1992, and the average prison
sentence rose from 5«  years in 1988 to 6 years in 1992.

-----------------------------------
Trends in the 75 largest counties: 
1986 to 1992
-----------------------------------

There are over 3,000 counties in the United States, but crime is
heavily concentrated in just 75 of them, the Nation's most
populous urban jurisdictions.  These 75 have 37% of the U.S.
population but in 1992 accounted for about half of the crimes
reported to police, half of all arrests, and half of all felony
convictions.

Data from a 1992 survey done for the National Pretrial Reporting
Program (NPRP) provide information on adjudication outcomes in
the 75 largest counties.  NPRP data indicate that following the
filing of 1992 felony charges in State courts, 14% of felony
defendants were convicted of a misdemeanor, 27% were dismissed
or acquitted, and 5% had other outcomes (for example,
adjudication deferred or case diverted from the justice system).
The remaining 54% were convicted of a felony.

Data from the 1992 National Judicial Reporting Program provide
additional information about those convicted of a felony in the
75 largest counties.

*The courts in the Nation's 75 largest urban counties convicted
71% more felons in 1992 than in 1986.  The rise over the 6 years
in the number of convictions outpaced the rise in adult arrests:

  Violent crime (murder, rape, robbery, and assault), among
adults--

    The number of arrests up 30%,
    The number of convictions up 48%.
    Murder arrests up 12%, convictions up 40%.
    Rape arrests down 11%, convictions up 20%.
    Robbery arrests up 10%, convictions up 33%.
    Assault arrests up 45%, convictions up 88%.

  Nonviolent crime, such as burglary and drug trafficking,
among adults--

     Burglary arrests down 2%, convictions up       28%.
     Drug trafficking arrests up 51%, convictions up
116%.

*Despite the increased volume of convictions, the amount of time
that courts took to dispose of cases (as indicated by elapsed
time from arrest to sentencing) declined from 1986 to 1992.  For
felonies generally, the average time from arrest to sentencing
was about 6 months (187 days) in 1992, down from about 7 months
(220 days) in 1986.  However, murder and rape, the two specific
crimes most frequently decided by trials rather than guilty
pleas, had no measurable decline in elapsed time.  The remaining
crimes had declines in case processing time of 3 weeks or longer.

*The percentage of violent crimes resulting in a prison sentence
was essentially unchanged from 1986 to 1992.  For nonviolent
crimes this percentage generally rose from 1986 to 1990 but
remained stable from 1990 to 1992.

----------------------
Method of conviction
----------------------

Of the 893,630 convicted felons, the vast majority--nearly
821,000, representing 92% of those sentenced  for a felony in
1992--pleaded guilty.  The rest were found guilty either by a
jury or by a judge in a bench trial.  Persons convicted of
murder were the least likely to have pleaded guilty (59%) and
the most likely to have been convicted by a jury (33%). 
Contrary to popular belief, however, neither murder nor violent
crime generally accounts for most jury trials.  Of all jury
trial felony convictions in 1992, 44% (16,680 cases) were for
violent crime; 56% (20,913 cases) were for nonviolent crime. 
The single felony category most frequently decided by juries was
drug trafficking (6,728 cases, or 18% of all jury convictions),
not murder (4,076 cases, or 11%).

Murderers convicted by a jury were the most likely to have
received a life sentence (47%) or the death penalty (4%).

--Less than 0.5%.


----------------------
Case processing time
----------------------

Mean elapsed time from arrest to sentencing in 1992 was nearly 7
months.  Median time was slightly under 5 months.  Jury trial
cases took the most time--10 months on average from arrest to
sentencing.   Cases disposed by guilty plea took the least
amount of time--a little over 6« months on average.

---------------------
Additional penalties
---------------------

Besides being sentenced to incarceration or probation, 37% or
more of convicted felons also were ordered to pay a fine, pay
victim restitution, receive treatment, perform community service,
or comply with some other additional penalty (for example,
undergo house arrest or appear periodically for drug testing).  A fine was
imposed on at least
18% of convicted felons. 

Minimum estimates of percentages receiving other penalties are
16% restitution, 7% some form of treatment, and 6% community
service. 

--------------
Methodology
--------------

Sampling
---------

Except for 1 county (replaced by another county), the sample of
300 counties drawn for the 1988 survey was also used in the 1992
survey. Every county in the Nation had a nonzero probability of
being in the sample. In general, the more felony cases a county
had, the more likely it was to be in the sample.

The survey used a two-stage, stratified cluster sampling design.
 In the first stage the Nation's 3,109 counties or county
equivalents were divided into 8 strata. Strata 1 and 2 consisted
solely of the 75 largest counties in the United States as
defined by the 1985 resident population.  Strata 3 through 8
consisted of the remaining 3,034 counties.

Because the 75 largest counties account for a disproportionately
large amount of serious crime in the Nation, they were given a
greater chance of being selected than the remaining counties.

Stratum 1 consisted of the 19 counties with the largest number
of felony convictions in 1985, plus 12 counties whose
participation in the survey had been prearranged.  Every county
in stratum 1 was selected for the sample.  Stratum 2 consisted
of the 44 most populous counties that were not in stratum 1. The
44 were ordered by their number of felony convictions in 1985,
and then approximately every other county was selected.  Stratum
2 thus contributed 23 counties to the sample.  Altogether, 54
out of the 75 largest counties were sampled. 

Data on 1985 felony convictions were obtained from a mail survey
described in State Felony Courts and Felony Laws (NCJ-106273)
and Census of State Felony Courts, 1985 (codebook for ICPSR
8667).  The 54 sampled counties in the 1992 NJRP survey were the
same 54 as in the 1986 and 1988 surveys.  The 3,034 counties not
among the 75 largest were placed into 6 strata defined by the
total number of felony convictions in 1985 and then arrayed
within stratum by region, and within region from largest to
smallest on felony conviction totals.  Sampling specifications
for the 6 strata are given in the Appendix table.

The final sample thus included 246 counties from among the 3,034
counties outside the 75 largest.  One of the 246 did not
participate.  That county was then replaced by another in the
same stratum.  Case-level data were successfully obtained on
convicted felons sentenced in 1992 from these 300 counties. 
(Two of the 300 had no felony convictions during the survey
period.)

The 60 sampled counties in strata 1 and 3 were self-representing
only, and their sampled cases therefore had a first stage
sampling weight of 1. The remaining 240 counties sampled from
strata 2 and 4 through 8 were selected to represent their
respective strata so that the felony conviction cases sampled
had first stage weights greater than 1.

At the second stage of sampling, a systematic sample of felons
sentenced for murder/nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery,
aggravated assault, burglary, felony larceny/motor vehicle
theft, fraud/forgery/embezzlement, drug trafficking, drug
possession, weapons offenses, and other offenses was selected
from each county's official records.  The total sample numbered
105,657 cases. Of these, 72,943 cases were in the 75 largest
counties.

Rates at which cases were sampled varied by stratum and crime
type. In smaller counties every felony case was taken. In larger
counties all murder cases and rape cases were typically
included, but other offense categories were sampled.

Before the sample of cases was drawn, each felon sentenced in
the sampled county in 1992 was placed into 1 of the 11 offense
categories identified above.  If the felon was convicted of more
than one felony offense, the offense category was the most
serious offense.   The hierarchy from most to least serious
offense was murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary,
drug trafficking, weapons, forgery/fraud/embezzlement, larceny/
motor vehicle theft, drug possession, all other felonies.  The
hierarchy was determined from an analysis of two factors that
reflect how seriously the justice system treats different
offenses: the sentence length imposed and the time actually
served in prison before release.  In general, the higher the
offense is in the hierarchy, the more serious it is in terms of
the two factors.

Sample selection procedures gave each sentenced felon a single
chance to be in the sample.  However, felons who appeared in
court on more than 1 day for different offenses and received a
sentence at each reappearance had more than a single chance.

At the data analysis stage, cases were aggregated according to
their offense designation at the time of sampling, with the
single exception of "other violent."  "Other violent" is a
category shown in the report's tables, but it was not a category
at sampling.  The "other violent" category was formed from the
sampling category "other felonies."  That is, after sampling,
sampled cases designated "other felonies" were coded "violent,"
"nonviolent," or "not ascertained," based on data available on
them.  Cases coded "not ascertained" were rare.  For data
analysis, cases coded "other violent" were removed from the
"other felonies" category and shown separately in the report's
tables.

Sampling error

----------------

NJRP data were obtained from a sample and not from a complete
enumeration; consequently, they are subject to sampling error. 
A standard error, which is a measure of sampling error, is
associated with each number in the report.  In general, if the
difference between two numbers is at least twice the standard
error of that difference (the criterion used in this report),
there is at least 95% confidence that the two numbers do in fact
differ; that is, the apparent difference is not simply the
result of surveying a sample rather than the entire population. 

National estimates of the number of convictions for individual
crime categories and for the aggregate total had a coefficient
of variation of 3%.  Standard errors for each table in the
report are on pages 13 through 16.


Sources of data
-----------------

State courts were the source of NJRP data for about 80% of the
300 counties sampled.  For other counties, sources included
prosecutors' offices, sentencing commissions, and statistical
agencies.  Individual-level NJRP records were obtained through a
variety of collection methods, including magnetic tape (61% of
the counties) and field collection (12%).

Photocopies of official documents and survey questionnaires
completed by court officials were additional data sources (27%).

Data collection for 235 counties was performed by the U.S.
Bureau of the Census and for 65 counties by the National
Association of Criminal Justice Planners.

Targeted population
----------------------

The survey targeted and recorded initial sentences imposed in
1992. If a sentence was imposed on one date and then modified at
a later date, the revision was ignored.  The survey recorded
sentences that were actually executed and excluded suspended
sentences.

Because the year of conviction was not a defining
characteristic, some cases in the sample were of persons
convicted before 1992 but not sentenced until 1992.

In a few counties where it was impractical to target sentences
in 1992, the target was felons convicted in 1992.  Hence, in
some of the cases the data pertain to sentences imposed after
1992.
