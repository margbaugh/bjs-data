In the 1997 Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional
Facilities, over 570,000 of the Nation's prisoners (51%)
reported the use of alcohol or drugs while committing their
offense.  While only a fifth of State prisoners were drug
offenders, 83% reported past drug use and 57% were using drugs
in the month before their offense, compared to 79% and 50%,
respectively, in 1991.  Also, 37% of State prisoners were
drinking at the time of their offense, up from 32% in 1991.

Among Federal prisoners the reports  of substance abuse
increased more sharply.  Although the proportion of Federal
prisoners held for drug offenses rose from 58% in 1991 to 63% in
1997, the percentage of all Federal inmates who reported using
drugs in the month before the offense rose more dramatically
from 32% to 45%.  A  fifth of Federal prisoners reported
drinking at the time of their offense  in 1997, up from a tenth
in 1991.

Over 360,000 prisoners C a third of State, and about a quarter
of Federal prisoners C said they had participated in drug or
alcohol treatment or other substance abuse programs since
admission.  Reported levels of drug treatment since admission
were lower for both State (10%) and Federal (9%) prisoners than
those reported in 1991 (25% and 16%, respectively).  Over the
same period, participation in other drug abuse programs
increased for both State (from 16% to 20%) and Federal.
prisoners (from 10% to 20%).

Since the last surveys in 1991, the    number of drug offenders
in State and Federal prisons has grown by   nearly 90,000, or an
average annual  growth rate of 6.4%.  However, the number of
inmates incarcerated for nondrug offenses has grown at virtually
the same rate over that period (6.3%).  As a result, drug
offenders make up the same proportion of the prison population
as in 1991, despite their substantial numerical growth.

In 1997 drug offenders in State prison reported extensive
criminal histories:

*54% were on probation, parole,  or escape at the time of their
arrest.

*83% had a prior sentence to incarceration or probation; 45%
had three or more prior sentences.

*24% had a prior violent offense; 32% reported that all
sentences had been for drug offenses.


Drug offenders in Federal prisons reported less severe criminal
histories than those in State prisons:

* 24% were on probation, parole, or escape at the time of arrest.

* 59% had a prior sentence; 24%  had three or more prior
sentences.

* 12% had a prior violent offense; 57% had been sentenced solely
 for drug offenses.


******************************************************************
Half of all prisoners were under the influence of alcohol or

******************************************************************


An estimated 51% of all prisoners (52% of State and 34% of
Federal) said they were under the influence of alcohol or drugs
while they committed their current offense (table 1).  Among
State prisoners the incidence of alcohol or drug use at the time
of offense showed little variation by offense type, ranging from
52% of violent offenders to 56% of public-order offenders. 
Among specific offense types only weapons (42%), fraud (43%),
and sexual assault (45%) offenders had a minority reporting the
influence of alcohol or drugs at the time of their offense.

Among Federal prisoners the reported use of alcohol or drugs at
the time of offense showed greater variation by offense type. 
Violent offenders (40%) reported the highest levels, followed 
by drug (35%), public-order (30%), and property (23%) offenders.
Among specific offense types only murder (52%) and assault
(51%) offenders had a majority reporting the use of alcohol or
drugs at the time of their current offense.  Fraud (15%) and
sexual assault (32%) offenders were among the Federal prisoners
least likely to have committed their current offense under the
influence of alcohol or drugs.

*************************
Assault, murder, and sexual assault most closely tied 
to alcohol use at the time of offense
************************* 


A third of State and a fifth of Federal prisoners reported the
influence of alcohol at the time of offense.  Among State
prisoners about two-fifths of public-order and violent offenders
were drinking at the time of offense, followed by a third of
property and a quarter of drug offenders.  Among Federal
prisoners reported use of alcohol at the time of offense varied
less by offense type, ranging from 16% of property offenders to
25% of violent offenders.  For both State and Federal prisoners,
the specific offenses most closely related to alcohol use at the
time of offense were violent ones — assault, murder,
manslaughter, and sexual assault.


*************************
A third of State and a fifth of Federal prisoners 
said they used drugs at the time of offense
*************************



A third of State prisoners said they had committed their current
offense while under the influence of drugs.  Drug (42%) and
property offenders (37%) reported the highest incidence of drug
use at the time of offense, followed by violent (29%) and
public-order offenders (23%).  Among specific offenses drug
possession (43%) and trafficking (41%) and robbery (40%) were
the most closely tied to drug influence, while manslaughter
(17%) and sexual assault (22%) offenders were the least likely
to report drug use during the offense.


About 1 in 5 Federal prisoners committed their offense under the
influence of drugs.  Among violent offenders Federal prisoners
(25%) were nearly as likely as State prisoners (29%) to report
drug influence.  However, Federal drug (25%) and property
offenders (11%) reported a much lower incidence of drug use
during the offense than State prisoners (42% and 37%,
respectively). Murder (29%) and robbery (28%) offenders were the
Federal prisoners most likely to report drug influence.  
 

*************************
Prior drug use by State prisoners remained stable 
since 1991, except for marijuana use
*************************

Over 80% of State prisoners said they had used drugs at some
time in the past; a slight increase since 1991  (table 2). 
Marijuana (77%) and cocaine-based drugs, including crack (49%),
were the most commonly used drugs, followed by hallucinogens
(29%), stimulants (28%), opiates, including heroin, and
depressants (both 24%).   In addition, about 1 in 7 State
prisoners reported using inhalants in the past.

Fifty-seven percent of State prisoners said they had used drugs
in the month before their current offense, up from 50% in 1991. 
The use of marijuana in the month before the offense (39%) had
increased since 1991 (32%), while the use of other drugs
remained largely unchanged.  A quarter of State prisoners
reported using cocaine-based drugs in the month before the
offense.  Opiates, including heroin, and stimulants (both 9%)
were the only other types of drugs used by more than 5% of State
prisoners in the month before the offense.



A third of State prisoners had used drugs at the time of
offense, which was almost unchanged since 1991.  The percentage
of State prisoners reporting marijuana use at the time of the
offense grew slightly from 11% to 15%, while the use of other
types of drugs remained the same since 1991.    Although many
more State prisoners had used marijuana (77%) than cocaine-based
drugs (49%) in the past, an equal percentage (15%) of State
inmates had used these drugs at the time of the offense. 


*************************
Nearly three-quarters of Federal prisoners had used 
drugs in the past--up from 60% in 1991
*************************



In 1991, 60% of Federal prisoners reported prior drug use,
compared to 79% of State prisoners (table 3).  In 1997 this gap
in prior drug use was narrowed, as the percentage of Federal
inmates reporting past drug use rose to 73%, compared to 83% of
State inmates.  This increase was mostly  due to a rise in the
percentage of Federal prisoners reporting prior use of marijuana
(from 53% in 1991 to 65%) and cocaine-based drugs (from 37% to
45%).

Most other drug types showed modest increases over this period. 
A fifth of Federal prisoners had used stimulants and
hallucinogens, followed by depressants and opiates, including
heroin (both 16%).  About 1 in 12 Federal prisoners reported the
prior use of inhalants.

The percentage of Federal inmates reporting past regular drug
use — using at least once a week for a month or longer  — also
rose, from 42% to 57% since 1991.  Past regular users of
marijuana grew from a third to nearly half of the Federal prison
population, while a quarter had used cocaine-based drugs
regularly.  Stimulants, such as methamphetamine, had been used
regularly by 13% of Federal prisoners, up from 8% in 1991.  


*************************
Over 40% of Federal prisoners used drugs in the month 
before the offense; 20% used cocaine or crack 
*************************
In the month before their current offense, 45% of Federal
prisoners had used drugs, an increase from the 32% reported in
1991.  The use of marijuana led this trend (up from 19% to 30%),
while use of cocaine-based drugs showed a smaller increase (from
15% to 20%).  Although the percentage of Federal prisoners using
stimulants grew slightly from 4% to 8%, fewer than 10% of
Federal inmates used any type of drug besides marijuana and
cocaine/crack in the month before the offense.


The percentage of Federal prisoners reporting the use of drugs
at the time of their offense grew from 17% to 22% since 1991. 
The percentage of Federal inmates using marijuana while
committing their offense grew from 6% to 11% over this period,
while the percentage using cocaine or crack was relatively
unchanged at 9%.  Fewer than 5% of Federal inmates had used any
other type of drug at the time of the offense.

Despite these increases in past drug use among Federal
prisoners, as well as their much higher percentage of drug
offenders (see box, page 2), higher percentages of State
prisoners still reported past drug use on all measures and for
each type of drug.

The CAGE questionnaire is a diagnostic instrument for
detecting a person's history of alcohol abuse or dependence. 
CAGE is an acronym for the four questions used by the instrument
C attempts to (C)ut back on drinking, (A)nnoyance at others'
criticism of one's drinking, feelings of (G)uilt about drinking,
and needing a drink first thing in the morning as an (E)ye
opener to steady the nerves.  The CAGE instrument determines a
person's likelihood of alcohol abuse by the number of positive
responses to these questions.

In a clinical test involving hospital admissions, three or more
positive CAGE responses carried a .99 predictive value for
alcohol abuse or dependence.*  In addition, there is a strong
relationship of positive CAGE responses to other self-reported 
indicators of prior alcohol abuse from the Survey of Inmates in
State Correctional Facilities (table above).  While 14% of those
State inmates with no positive CAGE responses reported 
a past "binge drinking" episode, the same was true of 88% of
those with four CAGE replies.  Likewise, 15% of those with 
zero positive CAGE responses had committed their offense while 
under the influence of alcohol, compared to 76% of those with 
four positive replies.  In this report, only those prisoners 
with three or more positive responses are categorized 
as alcohol abusive or dependent.

***Note***Data on the predictive values of the CAGE instrument 
are taken from the article "Screening for Alcohol Abuse Using 
the CAGE Questionnaire" by B. Bush and others, The American 
Journal of Medicine, Vol. 82, February 1987, pp. 231-35.

Responses from a quarter of State, a sixth of Federal prisoners

*************************

According to the CAGE diagnostic instrument (see box), 24% of
State prisoners reported experiences that are consistent with a
history of alcohol abuse or dependence (table 4).  The incidence
of alcohol abuse among State prisoners varied somewhat by
offense type.  Thirty-one percent of public-order offenders
provided three or more positive CAGE responses, followed by
property (27%), violent (24%), and drug offenders (19%).  
Drug offenders were also the least likely to report at least one
positive CAGE response (41%), while public-order offenders (56%)
were the most likely.

Federal prisoners were less likely than State inmates to report
past alcohol abuse or dependence.  Overall, 16% of Federal
prisoners provided three or more positive CAGE replies, with
little variation across offense types.  Violent (19%) and
public-order (17%) offenders were about as likely as drug (16%)
and property (15%) offenders to indicate a history of alcohol
abuse.  Federal prisoners were also less likely to have provided
at least one positive CAGE response (35%) than State prisoners
(46%).    

*************************
Over 60% of all prisoners had driven while 
under the influence of alcohol or drugs
*************************
Substantial percentages of both State and Federal prisoners
reported having engaged in dangerous and troubled behaviors
associated with past alcohol and drug abuse.  Among State
prisoners nearly two-thirds said they had previously driven
while under the influence of alcohol or drugs (table 5).  Half
of State prisoners had also experienced alcohol- or drug-related
domestic disputes (56%) or had been involved in physical fights
related to their alcohol or drug use (49%).  Over 40% had been
arrested at some time as a result of their alcohol or drug use,
and over 25% had experienced trouble at work or school.

A slightly lower percentage of Federal prisoners reported these
experiences.  As with State prisoners the most commonly reported
behavior was driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs
(59%).  Two-fifths of Federal prisoners had been involved in
alcohol- or drug-related domestic disputes, and nearly a third
of Federal prisoners reported a prior arrest involving their
alcohol or drug abuse.  A tenth of Federal prisoners had lost
their job due to alcohol or drug abuse, compared to a fifth of
State prisoners.  

Two-fifths of State prisoners reported a prior "binge drinking"
experience — consuming the equivalent of a fifth of liquor in a
single day.  In addition, 1 in 5 State prisoners said they had
used intravenous drugs in the past.  Fewer Federal inmates
reported both "binge drinking" (30%) and prior intravenous drug
use (12%). 


*************************
Prisoners were as likely to experience problems with 
alcohol as with drugs 
*************************

Breaking these behaviors down separately into alcohol- or
drug-related experiences yielded few substantial differences. 
For example, the percentage of State prisoners who had domestic
disputes (40%) or prior arrests (29%) related to alcohol abuse
matched those reporting such experiences related to drug use
(42% and 30%, respectively).  Among Federal prisoners similar
percentages reported driving under the influence of alcohol
(43%) and drugs (46%) and getting into alcohol- (29%) and
drug-related (30%) domestic disputes.  


*************************
Female State prisoners reported higher levels 
of past drug use; levels higher for male Federal prisoners
*************************

Women in State prisons (62%) were more likely than men (56%) to
have used drugs in the month before the offense (table 6). 
Women were also more likely to have committed their offense
while under the influence of drugs (40%, compared to 32%). 
However, nearly equal percentages of men and women in State
prisons reported using drugs in the past.

Among Federal prisoners higher percentages of men reported past 
drug use (74%, compared to 63% of women) as well as drug use in
the month before the offense (45%, compared to 37%).  At the
time of offense, about equal percentages of men (23%) and women
(19%) in Federal prisons reported the influence of drugs during
their offense. 


*************************
Prior drug use of State prisoners varies little by race;
Hispanics report lowest levels in Federal prisons
*************************

Among State prisoners prior drug use patterns varied little
across racial or ethnic groups.  Similar percentages of
non-Hispanic whites and blacks (84% of each) and Hispanics (81%)
reported using drugs in the past.  Slightly over half of each
group had used drugs in the month before the offense, and about
a third of each said they had used drugs at the time of offense.
 
In Federal prisons fewer Hispanics reported drug use on all
measures.  Less than half of Hispanic Federal prisoners had used
drugs regularly, and about a third used drugs in the month
before the offense.  Nearly equal percentages of non-Hispanic
whites and blacks reported past drug use (77% of whites, 78% of
blacks), regular drug use (63% and 62%), and drug use in the
month before the offense (49% and 47%).


*************************
Prisoners age 44 and younger report more prior 
drug abuse than older prisoners
*************************

Prisoners in age categories below 45 (87% of State, 76% of
Federal prisoners) reported similar levels of prior drug use,
and their incidence of drug use was consistently higher than
that of older prisoners. 

Over 80% of State prisoners under 45 reported some prior drug
use, compared to 63% of those 45 or older.  A third of State
prisoners under 45 said they committed their offense while on
drugs, compared to a fifth of those 45 or older.  Likewise, in
Federal prisons 49% of prisoners under 45 had used drugs in the
month before their offense, compared to 32% of older prisoners.  




*************************
Alcohol abuse more prevalent among 
whites, male prisoners
*************************
  
Prior alcohol abuse was more prevalent among male prisoners
(table 7).  Male State prisoners were more likely to have been
drinking at the time of the offense (38%) or to report past
binge drinking (42%) than women (about 29% for both).  However,
about a quarter of both men and women fit the CAGE profile of
alcohol dependence.

Among Federal inmates men were also more likely than women to
report each measure of alcohol abuse.  More male Federal inmates
committed their offense while drinking (21%) and were past
"binge drinkers" (31%) than women (15% and 19%, respectively). 

Non-Hispanic whites consistently reported the highest levels of
alcohol abuse among State inmates.  A majority of whites
reported a prior binge drinking experience, and a third met the
CAGE criteria for alcohol dependence.  Among Hispanic State
inmates 40% reported a prior binge drinking experience, and 22%
met the CAGE criteria for alcohol dependence, higher than blacks
on both measures (32% and 19%, respectively).  

Prior alcohol abuse varied little by race among Federal
prisoners.  White Federal inmates reported the highest incidence
of prior binge drinking (38%), but were not significantly higher
than black or Hispanic inmates on other alcohol abuse measures.

Prisoners' reports of alcohol abuse were not related to age. 
Among those State prisoners in the age groups between 25 and 54,
similar percentages reported all three measures of prior alcohol
abuse.

Among Federal prisoners, between 12% and 20% of all age groups
met the CAGE profile for alcohol dependence, and those reporting
alcohol influence at time of offense ranged from 13%  to 22% of
various age groups.


*************************
Three-quarters of all prisoners can be characterized 
as alcohol- or drug-involved offenders
*************************
About three-quarters of all prisoners reported some type of
involvement with alcohol or drug abuse in the time leading up to
their current offense. Among State prisoners the largest groups
of alcohol- or drug-involved inmates were those who used drugs
in the month before the offense (57%) and those under the
influence of alcohol or drugs while committing their offense
(52%).  Among Federal prisoners conviction for a drug offense
(63%) made up the largest component of alcohol or drug
involvement.  Fewer Federal than State prisoners abused drugs in
the month before the offense (45%), or used alcohol or drugs at
the time of offense (34%).

Many drug offenders reported that they were not using drugs
regularly in the month before their offense.  If such drug
offenders were excluded from this category, the percentage of
alcohol- or drug-involved State inmates drops slightly to 69%. 
However, with this restriction the percentage of Federal
prisoners who were alcohol- or drug-involved declines sharply to
52%.  

*************************
A third of State, a quarter of Federal prisoners

*************************

A third of State prisoners reported past participation in
alcohol or drug abuse treatment, such as time spent in a
residential facility, professional counseling, detoxification,
or use of a maintenance drug (table 8).  About 1 in 8 State
prisoners had participated in these types of alcohol or drug
treatment since their admission to prison.

in more than one type of treatment program.

Two-fifths of State prisoners also reported past participation
in other alcohol or drug abuse programs, such as self-help
groups, peer counseling, and education/awareness programs.  A
quarter of State prisoners had taken part in such programs since
their admission.  Overall, a majority (56%) of State prisoners
had taken part in either substance abuse treatment or other
alcohol and drug programs in the past, and a third had enrolled
in either since their admission to prison.


Among Federal prisoners 1 in 4 said they had ever been in
alcohol or drug treatment, and 1 in 10 had been treated since
their admission to prison.  In addition, a third of Federal
prisoners reported participation in other alcohol or drug
programs, and a fifth had taken part in such programs since
admission.


*************************
Treatment tied to past use, time remaining

*************************

Participation in treatment programs rose among those prisoners
involved with alcohol or drugs at the time of their offense. 
Among alcohol- or drug-involved State prisoners, 41% reported
past treatment, including 15% who had been treated since
admission.  Among Federal prisoners who had committed their
offense under the influence of alcohol or drugs, 41% reported
past treatment and 17% had been treated since admission.  About
two-thirds of all prisoners who committed their offense under
the influence had ever been in  treatment or other abuse
programs.

Participation in substance abuse treatment since admission also
varied by the amount of time remaining until expected release. 
Among those alcohol- or drug-involved prisoners serving their
final 6 months, a higher percentage said they had been treated
since admission (19% of State, 20% of Federal) than those with
over a year until release (13% of State, 10% of Federal). 
Participation in other abuse programs was also highest for those
alcohol- or drug-involved offenders serving their final 6 months
in prison.

*************************
Prisoners' participation in drug treatment dropped 
since 1991; other drug programs grew
*************************

In both State and Federal prisons, the percentage of inmates who
reported being treated for drug abuse since their admission
dropped since 1991 (table 9). In 1997, 1 in 10 State prisoners
reported being treated for drug abuse since admission; a
decrease from the 1 in 4 prisoners reporting such treatment in
1991.  There was also a drop in the percentage of Federal
prisoners (9%) reporting treatment since admission (16% in 1991).

*Regular use is defined as once a week for at least a month.


Since 1991 fewer prisoners with a drug abuse history reported
drug treatment since admission.  Among those prisoners who had
been using drugs in the month before the offense, 15% of both
State and Federal inmates said they had received drug abuse
treatment during their current prison term, down from a third of
such offenders in 1991.  Among those who were using drugs at the
time of offense, about 18% of both State and Federal prisoners
reported participation in drug treatment since admission,
compared to about 40% in 1991.  

Among both State and Federal prisoners, enrollment in other drug
abuse programs, such as self-help or peer groups and drug
education classes, had gone up over this period.  In 1997 20% of
both State and Federal prisoners reported participation in drug
abuse programs during their current prison term, up from 16% of
State and 10% of Federal prisoners in 1991.  Among those
prisoners who used drugs at the time of offense, participation
in these programs had risen to 32% of State and 38% of Federal
prisoners in 1997, compared to about 25% of each in 1991.

These data represent an underestimate of the total number of
prisoners who will ultimately receive drug treatment during
their current prison term.  At any one time the prison
population represents a broad range of inmates, from newly
admitted prisoners to those who have served as much as a decade
or more in prison.  The likelihood of receiving substance abuse
treatment increases as a prisoner's expected release date
approaches (text table, page 9).  Some of the inmates who did
not report drug abuse treatment since admission will receive
treatment before the completion of their prison term.    



*************************
1 in 4 prisoners participated in either drug treatment or other
drug abuse programs since admission
*************************

In both State and Federal prisons, about a quarter of all
prisoners had participated in either drug treatment or other
drug abuse programs since admission (table 10).  Among specific
types of programs, more State prisoners participated in
self-help or peer groups (16%) and drug abuse education classes
(10%) than in residential treatment (6%) and professional drug
abuse counseling (4%).

Compared to State prisoners= reported activities, participation
in self-help or peer groups was lower among Federal inmates
(9%), while enrollment in drug abuse education (15%) was higher
(table 11).  However, Federal prisoners' participation in either
of these programs still outpaced that of residential treatment
(6%) and professional counseling (3%) programs.

*************************
Among prisoners with past drug abuse, treatment 
provided less commonly than other programs
*************************

While drug treatment since admission was more prevalent among
those prisoners with drug abuse histories, more of these inmates
had been in other abuse programs.  Of those State prisoners who
used drugs in the month before the offense, 9% had been in a
residential treatment facility, and 6% had received professional
counseling since admission.  In comparison, 23% of these inmates
had joined a self-help or peer group since admission, and 14%
had taken a drug education class. 

Among those State inmates using drugs at the time of the
offense, 18% had been in drug treatment since admission, while
32% had enrolled in a drug abuse program or group.  Overall,
about 40% of these State prisoners had participated in either
drug treatment or another drug abuse program since admission.

Among Federal prisoners with a history of drug abuse, the
percentage reporting drug treatment since admission also rose. 
Of those who had used drugs in the month before the offense, 15%
had been treated since admission.  Among those Federal prisoners
who committed their offense under the influence of drugs, 19% had been treated
since admission, including 14% who had been in a residential
drug treatment program. 

As was the case in State prisons, more drug-abusing Federal
offenders participated in other drug abuse programs.  Among
Federal inmates who had used drugs in the month before the
offense, 32% had enrolled in programs such as drug abuse
education (24%) and self-help or peer groups (16%), compared to
11% reporting residential treatment.  Of those Federal inmates
who were using drugs at the time of offense, about twice as many
reported enrollment in a drug abuse program since admission
(38%), than participated in drug treatment (19%).

Overall, similar percentages of State and Federal prisoners
reported participation in either drug abuse treatment or other
programs since admission.  Among those offenders who had ever
used drugs, 29% of State and 32% of Federal prisoners reported
taking part in either drug treatment or other programs since
admission.  Participation increased among more serious drug
users and rose to nearly 40% of State and 46% of Federal
prisoners who had used drugs at the time of offense. 


*************************
A quarter of State and a fifth of Federal prisoners 
received alcohol treatment since admission
*************************

Since their admission to prison, nearly equal percentages of
State (8%) and Federal (7%) prisoners had been treated for
alcohol abuse (tables 12 and 13).  Participation in other
alcohol abuse programs, such as Alcoholics Anonymous and alcohol
education classes, was higher among both State (21%) and Federal
(17%) prisoners.

* Binge drinking is defined as having consumed as much as a fifth of liquor in
a single day, equivalent
to 3 bottles of wine, or as many as 3 six-packs of beer.


Among those prisoners with a history of alcohol abuse,
participation in alcohol treatment was more prevalent.  Of those
prisoners who reported a previous alcohol-related physical
fight, about 14% of both State and Federal prisoners said they
had been treated for alcohol abuse since admission.

About 1 in 6 State and Federal prisoners who met the CAGE
criteria for alcohol dependence reported taking part in alcohol
treatment during their current prison term.


*************************
Less than a fifth of alcohol-abusing prisoners received
treatment; about a third enrolled in other programs
*************************


Prisoners who had abused alcohol were less likely to report
participation in alcohol treatment than in other abuse programs.
 Among State prisoners who committed their offense while
drinking, more prisoners had enrolled in self-help or peer
groups (29%) and alcohol abuse education classes (16%) since
admission than had been in residential treatment (9%) or
professional counseling (6%).  Among those State prisoners who
provided three or more positive CAGE responses, a third had
enrolled in self-help or peer groups alone, compared to fewer
than a fifth who had been in any kind of alcohol treatment since
admission.

Federal prisoners with a history of alcohol abuse also reported
greater participation in alcohol abuse programs than in alcohol
treatment.  Among those Federal prisoners who had committed
their offense while under the influence of alcohol, more
prisoners had enrolled in alcohol education classes (19%) and
self-help or peer groups (18%) since admission than in
residential treatment (10%) or professional counseling (5%).

Overall, the rates of participation in alcohol treatment and
other programs were fairly equal in State and Federal prisons. 
Among those prisoners who were drinking at the time of the
offense, 14% of both State and Federal inmates said that they
had been treated for alcohol abuse since admission.  Also,
similar percentages of State (44%) and Federal (41%) prisoners
who met the CAGE profile for alcohol dependence had taken part
in either alcohol treatment or other programs since admission.



*************************
Women, whites more likely to receive substance 
abuse treatment since admission to State prison
*************************



Among those State prisoners who can be described as alcohol- or
drug-involved offenders, women (56%) were more likely than men
(41%) to have ever been treated for substance abuse (table 14). 
A higher percentage of female alcohol- or drug-involved
offenders (20%, compared to 14% of male offenders) also reported
being treated since their admission to prison.  However, equal
percentages of men and women  reported participation in a
substance abuse program, both in the past (49%) and since
admission (32%).

Slightly higher percentages of white alcohol- or drug-involved
State prisoners (17%) said they were treated for substance abuse
since admission, compared to blacks (13%) and Hispanics (12%). 
Whites were also the only group of alcohol- or drug-involved
prisoners to have a majority report past substance abuse
treatment (52%) or past alcohol or drug programs (58%).

The prevalence of substance abuse treatment among alcohol- or
drug-involved offenders showed little relationship to age. 
Similar rates of State prisoners in age groups between 25 and 54
reported treatment during their current sentence (about 1 in 6
of each) as well as participation in other programs (about 1 in
3 of each).  Those alcohol- or drug-involved prisoners 24 or
younger, and those 55 or older, reported the lowest incidence of
participation in substance abuse treatment or other programs.

Substance abuse treatment of Federal prisoners 
shows little variation by sex or age
*************************

Among those Federal prisoners characterized as alcohol- or
drug-involved offenders, similar percentages of men (12%) and
women (13%) said they received substance abuse treatment since
admission (table 15).  About a quarter of both male and female
alcohol- or drug-involved prisoners reported enrollment in other
substance abuse programs since admission.

As with alcohol- or drug-involved offenders in State prisons,
whites were the most likely of these inmates in Federal prisons
to receive treatment since admission (16%), compared to blacks
(12%) and Hispanics (8%).  More whites were also enrolled in
other substance abuse programs since admission (35%) than other
inmates.  

The rate of treatment of alcohol- or drug-involved Federal
prisoners varied little by age.  For those inmates in age groups
between 25 and 54, the percentage who had been treated since
admission only ranged from 12% to 14%, and about 27% of each had
taken part in other substance abuse programs since admission. 
Federal inmates in both the youngest and oldest age groups
reported lower participation in both treatment and other
programs. 


*************************
Methodology
*************************

The U.S. Bureau of the Census conducted the 1997 Survey of
Inmates in State Correctional Facilities (SISCF) for the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the 1997 Survey of Inmates in
Federal Correctional Facilities (SIFCF) for BJS and the Bureau
of Prisons.  From June through October, 1997, inmates were
interviewed about their current offense and sentences, criminal
histories, family and personal backgrounds, gun possession and
use, prior drug and alcohol use and treatment, educational
programs, and other services provided while in prison.  Similar
surveys of State prison inmates were conducted in 1974, 1979,
1986, and 1991.  Federal inmates were surveyed for the first
time in 1991.


*************************
Sample design
*************************


The samples for the SISCF and SIFCF were taken from a universe
of 1,409 State prisons and 127 Federal prisons enumerated in the
1995 Census of State and Federal Adult Correctional Facilities
or opened between completion of the census and June 30, 1996. 
The sample design for both surveys was a stratified two-stage
selection; first, selecting prisons, and second, selecting
inmates in those prisons.

In the first stage correctional facilities were separated into
two sampling frames:  one for prisons with male inmates and one
for prisons with female inmates.  Prisons holding both sexes
were included on both lists.

In the sampling of State facilities, the 13 largest male prisons
and 17 largest female prisons were selected with certainty.  The
remaining 1,265 male facilities and 261 female facilities were
stratified into 14 strata defined by census region (Northeast
except New York, New York, Midwest, South except Texas, Texas,
West except California, and California).  Within each stratum
facilities were ordered by facility type (confinement and
community-based), security level (maximum, medium, minimum, and
none), and size of population.  A systematic sample of prisons
was then selected within strata with probabilities proportionate
to the size of each prison.

For the sample of Federal prisons, one male prison and two
female prisons were selected with certainty.  The remaining 112
male facilities were classified into 5 strata defined by
security level (high, medium, low, minimum, and administrative).
 The 20 remaining female facilities were stratified into 2
strata by security level (administrative and not
administrative).  Within security level, facilities were ordered
by size of population and then selected with probability
proportionate to size.

For the State survey 280 prisons were selected, 220 male
facilities and 60 female facilities.  Of the 280 facilities 3
refused to allow interviewing and 2 closed before the survey
could be conducted.  Overall, 32 male facilities and 8 female
facilities were selected for the Federal survey, and all
participated.

In the second stage, inmates were selected for interviewing. 
For State facilities interviewers selected the sample
systematically using a random start and a total number of
interviews based upon the size and sex of the facility.  For the
Federal facilities, a sample of inmates was selected for each
facility from the Bureau of Prisons central list, using a random
start and predetermined sampling interval.  All selected drug
offenders were then subsampled so that only a third were
eligible for interview.  As a result, approximately 1 in every
75 men and 1 in 17 women were selected for the State survey, and
1 in every 13 men and 1 in every 3 women were selected for the
Federal survey.  A total of 14,285 interviews were completed for
the State survey and 4,041 for the Federal survey, for overall
response rates of 92.5% in the State survey and 90.2% in the
Federal survey.

The interviews, about an hour in length, used computer-assisted
personal interviewing (CAPI).  With CAPI, computers provide
questions for the interviewer, including follow-up questions
tailored to preceding answers.  Before the interview, inmates
were told verbally and in writing that participation was
voluntary and that all information provided would be held in
confidence.  Participants were assured that the survey was
solely for statistical purposes and that no individual who
participated could be identified through use of survey results.


*************************
Estimates of prisoner counts
*************************

Based on the completed interviews, estimates for the entire
population were developed using weighting factors derived from
the original probability of selection in the sample.  These
factors were adjusted for variable rates of nonresponse across
strata and inmates' characteristics and offenses.  The sample
for the State survey was adjusted to midyear custody counts for
June 30, 1997, from data obtained in the National Prisoner
Statistics series (NPS-1A).  The sample from the Federal
facilities was weighted to the total known sentenced custody
population at midyear 1997.

Excluded from the estimate of Federal inmates were unsentenced
inmates and those prisoners under Federal jurisdiction but
housed in State and private contract facilities.  Those
prisoners who were under State jurisdiction, yet held in local
jails or private facilities, were excluded from the estimated
number of State prisoners.  As a result, the estimated prisoner
counts do not match those in other BJS data series.   

The estimated prisoner counts vary according to the particular
data items analyzed.  Estimates are based on the number of
prisoners who provided information on selected items. (See
appendix table 1 for level of missing data on current offense.)

Note: In 1991 current offense data were available for 99.4% of sentenced State
prisoners and 99.4% of sentenced Federal prisoners. In 1997 current offense
data were available for 98.8% of sentenced Federal prisoners.


The offense distribution of State prisoners in the 1997 survey
was largely unchanged from that of the 1991 survey.  The
percentage of property offenders had decreased slightly since
1991 (from 25% to 22%), while the percentage of public-order
offenders had risen slightly (from 7% to 10%).  Among Federal
prisoners the offense distribution displayed more change since
the 1991 survey.  The percentage of violent (15%) and property
(7%) offenders had declined slightly since 1991 (17% and 10%,
respectively), while the percentage of drug (63%) and
public-order offenders (15%) had risen since 1991 (58% and 12%,
respectively).  

For an offense distribution of the complete enumeration of
Federal prisoners, refer to Compendium of Federal Justice
Statistics (volumes 1991 through 1996).

*************************
Accuracy of the estimates
*************************


The accuracy of the estimates presented in this report depends
on two types of error:  sampling and nonsampling.  Sampling
error is the variation that may occur by chance because a sample
rather than a complete enumeration of the population was
conducted.  Nonsampling error can be attributed to many sources,
such as nonresponses, differences in the interpretation of
questions among inmates, recall difficulties, and processing
errors.  In any survey the full extent of the nonsampling error
is never known.  The sampling error, as measured by an estimated
standard error, varies by the size of the estimate and the size
of the base population. 

Estimates of the standard errors have been calculated for the
1997 surveys. (See appendix tables 2 and 3).  For example, the
95-percent confidence interval around the percentage of State
inmates who ever used drugs is approximately 83.0% plus or minus
1.96 times 0.4% (or 82.2.% to 83.8%).

These standard errors may also be used to test the significance
of the difference between two sample statistics by pooling the
standard errors of the two sample estimates.  For example, the
standard error of the difference between black and white State
prison inmates for the percent reporting a binge drinking
experience would be 1.2% (or the square root of the sum of the
squared standard errors for each group).  The 95-percent
confidence interval around the difference would be 1.96 times
1.2% (or 2.4%).  Since the difference of 21.6% (53.5% minus
31.9%) is greater than 2.4%, the difference would be considered
statistically significant. 

The same procedure can be used to test the significance of the
difference between estimates from the two surveys.  For example,
the standard error of the difference between Federal and State
prison inmates for the percent reporting prior drug use would be
1.1%.  The 95-percent confidence interval around the difference
would be 1.96 times 1.1% (or 2.1%).  Since the difference of
10.1% (83.0% minus 72.9%) is greater than 2.1%, the difference
would be considered statistically significant.

All comparisons discussed in this report were statistically
significant at the 95-percent confidence level.  To test the
significance of comparisons not mentioned in this report, use
percentages in text or tables and numbers of inmates.  These
standard errors  should be used only for tests on all inmates. 
Comparisons of male and female inmates require different
standard errors.
