Todd D. Minton
BJS Statistician

At midyear 2008 a total of 2,135 inmates were confined in
Indian country jails, a 1.3% decrease from the 2,163 inmates
confined at midyear 2007 (figure 1).  This count was based on
data from 82 facilities--jails, confinement facilities,
detention centers, and other correctional facilities--that
were in operation in Indian country at midyear 2008.  For
2007, BJS' estimate of the number of inmates was based on
data for 83 facilities in operation at midyear 2007.  The
slight decrease in inmate population from 2007 to 2008
reverses the increase in the number held in Indian country
jails that occurred between 2004 and 2007, when the inmate
population increased by 24% from 1,745 to 2,163.  On June 30,
2008, the number of American Indians and Alaska Natives
confined in jails outside of Indian country (9,000) was more
than 4 times the number held in jails in Indian Country (see
box on page 2).

The number of jails in Indian country has increased

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) collected data from 68
correctional facilities in Indian country in 2004, from 79 in
2007, and from 82 in 2008.  Over this 4-year period, a number
of facilities closed and new facilities became operational.
Twenty-one facilities were newly constructed or new to the
survey in 2007, and two new facilities were added to the
survey during 2008. In addition, one facility that was closed
in 2004 reopened during 2007 and was included in the 2007 and
2008 surveys. Ten facilities closed during the 4-year period. 
BJS estimated inmate population counts for 7 facilities in
2004 and 4 facilities in 2007 that did not respond to the
surveys. All known operating facilities responded to the 2008
survey.

Highlights

*The number of inmates confined in Indian country jails
declined by 1.3% at midyear 2008, dropping to 2,135 inmates.

The number of inmates admitted into Indian country jails
during June 2008 was about 6 times the size of the average
daily population.

*Since midyear 2004, jail bed space for admissions expanded
faster than the growth in the inmate population (37% compared
to 22%).

*Thirty-six facilities were operating above their rated
capacity on their most crowded day in June 2008. Of these
facilities, 17 were operating above their rated capacity at
midyear 2008 and 16 were operating above their rated capacity
on an average day in June 2008.

*Sixteen jails (a fifth of all facilities) held 53% of the
inmates confined at midyear 2008.

*Inmates held for aggravated and simple assault increased at
midyear 2008; domestic violence declined.

The number of American Indians and Alaska Natives under
correctional supervision (probation, parole or incarcerated
in jail or prison) reached 75,388 at midyear 2008, up from
71,274 at midyear 2007

According to the U.S. Census Bureau's National Population
Estimates, 3,083,434 American Indians and Alaska Natives
lived in the United States as of July 1, 2008, accounting for
1% of the U.S. resident population. The number of American
Indians and Alaska Natives in jail or prison accounted for
1.2% (28,388) of all inmates in custody in jail or prison in
the U.S.

The local governing authority on Indian lands is typically a
tribal government or council. Jurisdiction over crimes in
Indian country depends on several factors, including the
identity of the victim and the offender, the severity of the
crime, and the location where the crime was committed. Tribal
jurisdiction includes crimes committed by Indians in Indian
country. Tribal rights to sentence offenders are limited to 1
year of imprisonment or a $5,000 fine, or both (25 U.S.C. 
1302(7)). Federal jurisdiction over crime in Indian country
includes 14 crimes under the Major Crimes Act of 1885 (18
U.S.C.  1153), and state jurisdiction includes all crimes on
tribal lands specified under Public Law 280 (18 U.S.C. 
1162).

At midyear 2008, tribal, federal, and state prison or jail
authorities held 921 American Indians per 100,000 American
Indian U.S. residents an incarceration rate based on 28,388
American Indians confined in prisons or jails and 3 million
in the U.S. resident population (American Indians in this
report includes Alaska Natives.) The incarceration rate for
American Indians was about 21% higher than the overall
national incarceration rate of 759 per 100,000 persons other
than American Indians or Alaska Natives. Federal, state,
local, and tribal correctional authorities supervised 75,388
American Indians in 2008, up from 71,274 in 2007 (figure 2).
Between 2000 and 2008, the number of American Indians
confined in jails and prisons nationwide grew on average by
about 4.3% annually. 

Of American Indians under any form of correctional
supervision in 2008, most (62% or 47,000) were supervised in
the community on probation or parole (table 1). A total of
28,388 American Indians were in jail or prison at midyear
2008. More than half (14,264) were held in state prison, and
about 1 in 10 was held in federal prison (2,989). The
remaining 11,135 American Indians were confined in Indian
country jails (2,135) and local jails (9,000). Some American
Indians confined in local jails may have been adjudicated by
a tribal criminal justice system and housed in jails under
contracts with tribal, city, or county governments.

Between midyear 2007 and 2008 the number of American Indians
under correctional supervision increased by 5.8%. The number
of American Indians confined in jails and prisons nationwide
grew by approximately 2.6% from 2007 to 2008. Over the
12-month period, the largest growth in the confined American
Indian population occurred in local jails (4.7%), followed by
state prison (2.2%), and federal prison (1.2%). Indian
country jails experienced a decline in the inmate population
(-1.3%). 

Bed space for inmates continues to grow faster than the
confined population in Indian country 

At midyear 2008, the 82 jail facilities in Indian country
were rated to hold 2,963 inmates, up from 2,900 in 83
facilities during the same period in 2007. On June 30, 2008,
those facilities held a total of 2,135 inmates and were
operating at 72% of rated capacity (table 2). On an average
day in June, the custody population was 1,903 inmates, and
facilities in Indian country were operating at 64% of
capacity. From June 2004 to June 2008, the overall number of
beds (or rated capacity) grew at a faster rate (37%) than the
22% growth in the inmate population.

Most inmates were confined in the larger Indian country jail
facilities rated to hold 25 or more inmates

Of the 2,135 inmates confined in 82 Indian country facilities
in midyear 2008, about 85% (1,821) were held in 47 facilities
rated to hold 25 or more inmates (table 3). About half of the
inmate population was held in 33 facilities rated to hold 25
to 49 inmates. The 35 facilities with a rated capacity of
fewer than 25 inmates accounted for about 43% of all
facilities and held under 15% of the total inmate population
in Indian country at midyear 2008.

At midyear 2008, 16 jails in Indian country held more than
half (53%) of the total inmate population (table 4). Between
midyear 2007 and midyear 2008, the inmate population in those
jails increased by 145 persons (17%).

About a quarter (12) of the Indian country jails rated to
hold 25 or more inmates were located in Arizona. These jails
held about a third (730 inmates) of the total custody
population in Indian country. In absolute numbers, the
Standing Rock Law Enforcement and Adult Detention reported
the largest increase in the number of inmates (61) held
between midyear 2007 and midyear 2008, due in part to an
expanded law enforcement initiative. The Gila River
Department of Corrections and Supervision-Adult reported the
largest decline (62 inmates or 26%) in its inmate population
during this period. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Department
of Corrections followed closely with a decline (18 inmates or
26%) in their inmate population. 

The smallest and largest jails in Indian country used less
bed space for confined inmates

Indian country jails were operating at about 64% of rated
capacity on an average day in June and at about 72% of rated
capacity at midyear 2008. An average day in June was based on
the average daily population, or the number of inmates
confined in June divided by 30. The lowest percent of
capacity occupied during June 2008 was among the smallest and
the largest jails (figure 3). 

Twelve jails (rated to hold fewer than 10 inmates) were
operating at 20% of their rated capacity on an average day in
June 2008, compared to 32% at midyear 2008 (last weekday in
June). Large jails in Indian country with a rated capacity of
50 or more inmates had nearly half of their bed space
occupied on an average day in June (49%) and at midyear
(51%). Indian country jails rated to hold 25 to 49 inmates
were operating near full capacity (97%) at midyear 2008 and
at 83% of their capacity on an average day in June 2008.

The amount of bed space occupied was also measured based on a
facility's most crowded day in June. About 4 in 10 facilities
(36) in Indian country were operating above rated capacity on
the facility's most crowded day in June (table 5). Of those
facilities, 17 were operating above rated capacity at
midyear, and 16 were operating above rated capacity on an
average day in June 2008.

18 jails were operating at more than 50% over capacity on
their most crowded day in June 2008

At midyear 2008, 18 jails in Indian country reported
operating at more than 50% over their rated capacity on the
facility's most crowded day in June 2008, which was the same
as the number of facilities at more than 50% over capacity
during June 2007 (table 6). Each jail had a rated capacity of
fewer than 50 inmates.

Among jails (18) operating at more than 50% over rated
capacity on their peak day in June 2008, nearly two-thirds
(11) were rated to hold fewer than 25 inmates. Seven were
rated to hold 25 or more inmates. The largest of these jails,
Standing Rock Law Enforcement and Adult Detention, had a
rated capacity of 48 inmates and was operating at 56% over
capacity. The White Mountain Apache Detention Center had a
rated capacity of 46 inmates and was 146% over capacity on
its peak day in June. 

The Tohono O'odham Adult Detention Center had the highest
occupancy rate (429%) and the largest number of inmates over
capacity (112) on its most crowded day in June 2008. Of the
18 facilities, the Standing Rock Law Enforcement and Adult
Detention had the lowest occupancy rate (156%) on its peak
day in June 2008.

Among the 18 facilities operating at more than 50% over their
rated capacity on their most crowded day in June, four were
also operating at more than 50% over capacity at midyear
2008. Three facilities were operating at more than 50% over
capacity during all three points at which capacity is
measured (midyear, most crowed day, and the average day in
June 2008): Tohono O'odham Adult Detention Center, the White
Mountain Apache Detention Center, and the Acoma Tribal Police
and Holding Facility.

High volumes of inmates were processed through Indian country
jails

Eighty-one Indian country jails admitted 11,149 persons
during June 2008, down from 12,490 admissions in 79
facilities during the same period in 2007 (table 7). The
number of admissions grew by 2.6% in 76 facilities that
reported on their admissions in both June 2007 (10,435) and
June 2008 (10,705) (not shown in a table). Three facilities
accounting for 16% or 2,055 of all admissions (12,490) during
June 2007 were closed during June 2008. Five facilities that
did not report on the number admissions during June 2007
accounted for 4.0% (444) of all admissions (11,149) during
June 2008.
 
About 59% (6,595) of all admissions in June 2008 occurred in
facilities rated to hold 25 to 49 inmates. Combined, the 81
facilities that reported on admissions had about 138
admissions per month on average in June 2008. Thirty-three
facilities rated to hold 25 to 49 inmates had the largest
number of admissions (200) per month on average during June
2008. This was followed by 14 facilities rated to hold 50 or
more inmates that admitted 137 persons per month on average
and 22 facilities rated to hold 10 to 24 inmates that
admitted 110 persons per month on average. Twelve facilities
rated to hold fewer than 10 inmates admitted about 19 persons
per month on average during June 2008.

In 2008 four deaths in custody were reported by jail
authorities between July 1, 2007, and June 30, 2008. One of
the deaths was classified as a suicide. During the 12-month
period, 70 inmates held in Indian country facilities
attempted suicide.

Expected length of stay was 5.1 days for Indian country jail
inmates in June 2008

During June 2008, the expected length of stay for inmates
confined in Indian country jails was 5.1 days, up from 4.5
days during the same period in 2007. The closure of the Pine
Ridge Police Department and Adult Detention accounted for
most of the change in the expected length of stay between
2007 and 2008.

The expected length of stay for inmates was the highest (10.3
days) in facilities that were rated to hold 50 or more
inmates, up from 9.4 days in June 2007. Inmates held in jails
rated to hold less than 10 inmates experienced the shortest
expected length of stay (1.8 days).

Inmate characteristics remain relatively unchanged

Inmate characteristics by gender, age, and offense have
changed in absolute numbers since 2000 (table 8). However,
the distribution within most categories has remained stable
during the past 8 years.

Adult males accounted for the largest portion of the inmate
population in Indian country jails during the decade. The
absolute number of adult female inmates increased slightly,
while the overall percentage of female inmates held in Indian
country jails declined from 23% in 2004 to 21% in 2008.

From 2007 to 2008, the percentage of inmates in custody with
a conviction status increased from 59% at midyear 2007 to 63%
during the same period in 2008. About 4 in 10 inmates were
confined for a violent offense at midyear 2008, relatively
unchanged since 2004. Domestic violence and simple or
aggravated assault (each 15%) accounted for the largest
percentage of violent offenders held in 2008, followed by
unspecified violent offenses (9%) and rape or sexual assault
(2%). 

Sixty-two facilities reported complete data on inmate offense
characteristics in 2007 and 2008. Of these, 17 facilities
experienced an increase in the number of inmates held for a
domestic violence offense, and 20 facilities reported a
decline in their domestic violence population. The Gila River
Department of Corrections-Adult contributed to a significant
portion (70%) of the decline. It experienced a 26% decrease
in the confined inmate population between midyear 2007 (241)
and midyear 2008 (179), and a 55% decline in the number of
inmates held for a domestic violence (from 180 in 2007 to 81
in 2008). 

Since 2000, less than 1 in 10 inmates in Indian country jails
were in custody for a drug offense. In absolute numbers, 104
inmates were in custody for a drug law violation at midyear
2008, down from 132 in 2004. Inmates in custody for a DWI/DUI
offense declined during the 8-year period, from 17% at
midyear 2000 to 9% at midyear 2008.

Jail operations staff accounted for the majority of persons
employed by Indian country jails

Eighty-one jails in Indian country employed 1,303 persons at
midyear 2008 (table 9). About 70% (912) of all personnel were
jail operations staff, including correctional officers and
other staff who spent more than 50% of their time supervising
inmates. The remaining 391jail personnel included
administrative employees, educational staff, technical or
professional staff, clerical, maintenance, or food service
staff, and other job functions. Eighty facilities reported
that 630 (69%) correctional officers had received basic
detention officer certification, up from 63% reported in
2007. Seventy-six facilities reported that 646 (74%)
correctional officers had received 40 hours of in-service
training, up from 70% in 2007. Overall, the ratio of inmates
to jail operations employees was 2.3 to 1 respectively at
midyear 2008, down from 2.5 to 1 at midyear 2004. 

Methodology

The Annual Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) includes
all known Indian country correctional facilities operated by
tribal authorities or the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA),
U.S. Department of the Interior. The survey was conducted in
June 2008 and included the number of inmates and percent of
capacity occupied based on the average daily population,
midyear population, and peak population in facilities in June
2008 (table 10).

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducted the SJIC to
describe all adult and juvenile jail facilities and detention
centers in Indian country. For this report, Indian country
includes reservations, pueblos, rancherias, and other
appropriate areas (18 U.S.C. 1151). The reference date for
the survey is June 30, 2008.

Annually, the Office of Justice Services, Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA), U.S. Department of the Interior, provides to
BJS a list of Indian country jail facilities. The list
includes detention centers, jails, and other correctional
facilities operated by tribal authorities or the BIA. BJS
uses this list to amend its existing roster of jails in
Indian country.  BJS obtains data from administrators of
Indian country jails by mailed questionnaires and through
follow-up phone calls and facsimiles. 

In 2004, BJS contacted administrators in 70 facilities to
participate in the survey; BJS received responses from 61
facilities; 7 did not respond and two facilities were
non-operational.  In 2007, the BJS roster consisted of 86
facilities. Seventy-nine of the facility administrators
responded to the survey; 4 did not respond; and BJS found
that 3 facilities were non-operational.  For 2008, BJS'
roster of Indian country jails consisted of 85 facilities;
BJS received responses from 82 facility administrators; there
were no nonrespondents; and 3 facilities were non-operational.  

For comparison over time, BJS estimated data on inmate
populations for the 7 facilities in 2004 and 4 facilities in
2007 that did not respond to the surveys.

Expected length of stay

The stock-flow ratio method was used to measure the expected
length of stay for inmates held during June 2008 in the 81
Indian country jails that responded to stock and flow items
in the survey:

Stock--average daily population

Flow--inmate admissions during June 2008

Stock--flow ratio in June 2008 (1,883/11,149)

Length of stay in days (0.17 x 30).

Indian country is a statutory term that includes all lands
within an Indian reservation, dependent Indian communities,
and Indian trust allotments (18 U.S.C.  1151). Courts
interpret  1151 to include all lands held in trust for
tribes or their members. See United States v. Roberts, 185
F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 1999). Tribal authority to imprison
American Indian offenders is limited to one year per offense
by statute (25 U.S.C.  1302), a $5,000 fine, or both.

Tribal law enforcement agencies act as first responders to
both felony and misdemeanor crimes. For most of Indian
country, the federal government provides felony law
enforcement concerning crimes by or against Indians. Certain
areas of Indian country are under Public Law 83-280, as
amended. P.L. 280 conferred jurisdiction on certain states
over Indian country and suspended enforcement of the Major
Crimes Act (18 U.S.C.  1153) and the General Crimes Act (18
U.S.C.  1152) in those areas. Indian tribes retain
concurrent jurisdiction to enforce laws in Indian country
where P.L. 280 applies.
