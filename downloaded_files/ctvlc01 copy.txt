Totals and trends

*  During 2001 an estimated 3,698 contract cases were disposed of by trial 
in State courts of general jurisdiction in the Nation's 75 largest counties.
Contract cases represented nearly a third of all civil trials in these
counties.

*  Judges adjudicated 56% of contract cases, while juries decided the
remaining 44%.

*  The 3,698 contract trials disposed of in 2001 represented a 24% decline
from the 4,850 contract trials disposed of in these counties in 1996.

*  About half (54%) of the contract cases disposed of by trial in the 
Nation's 75 largest counties in 2001 involved failed agreements between 
buyers and sellers. In most contract trials, the litigants were either
individuals suing businesses (33%) or non-individuals such as businesses,
hospitals, or governments suing businesses (26%). 

Plaintiff winners

*  Plaintiffs won in 65% of contract trials. Plaintiffs were more likely to
prevail in contract trials decided by a judge (68%) than by a jury (62%).  

*  The overall plaintiff win rate in contract trials remained relatively
unchanged from 1996. Plaintiff win rates in contract jury trials, however,
increased from 56% in 1996 to 62% in 2001.

Damage awards

*  In 2001 the overall median damage award, which includes both compensatory
and punitive damages, for plaintiff winners in contract trials was $45,000.

*  Plaintiff winners garnered higher median damage awards in contract jury
trials ($81,000) compared to contract bench trials ($30,000). 

*  Nearly 11% of plaintiff winners in contract jury trials received awards 
of $1 million or more, while about 2% of plaintiff winners in contract bench
trials won damages totaling $1 million.

*  No significant changes were found in the median damage awards in contract
jury or bench trials disposed of in the Nation's 75 largest counties from 
1996 to 2001.

Punitive damages

*  In 2001 punitive damages were awarded to 6% of plaintiff winners in
contract trials. In cases with plaintiff winners, judges imposed punitive
damages in 3% of contract trials, while juries awarded punitive damages in 
10% of contract trials. 

*  Punitive damages were awarded most frequently in contract trials involving
fraud, employment discrimination, or partnership dispute claims.

*  The median punitive damage award for plaintiff winners in contract trials
was $83,000 (not shown in a table). 

Time to disposition

*  Contract cases tried before a jury took slightly over 2 years (25 months)
on average to proceed from filing to disposition. Contract bench trials, in
comparison, were disposed within an average of 18 months. 

Post verdict relief
 
*  Plaintiffs filed motions for post verdict relief in 12% of contract trials
that they won, while defendants requested post verdict relief in 26% of
contract trials with a plaintiff winner. 

*  Motions for new trials or award modifications were among the most common
types of post verdict relief sought by plaintiff winners. Defendants made
requests for new trials in about 60% of contract trials in which they sought
post verdict relief.

*  Plaintiffs filed motions for post verdict relief in 18% of contract trials
that they lost. Defendants engaged in post verdict activity in less than 10%
of contract trials without a plaintiff winner.

*  The courts granted post verdict relief to 57% of plaintiff winners seeking
to have their verdict modified. The most common type of post verdict relief
granted to these plaintiffs was an award modification. Among contract trials
in which the plaintiff lost, post verdict relief was granted to 12% of
plaintiffs who sought some form of post trial relief.

*  Post verdict relief was granted to about a third of defendants who sought
to modify a favorable plaintiff verdict or judgment. In almost half of these
cases, the relief granted was in the form of an award modification.

*  Plaintiffs filed appeals in 7% of contract trials in which they prevailed
and 21% of contract trials in which they lost. Defendants gave notice of
appeal in 20% of contract trials with a plaintiff winner and 4% of contract
trials where the plaintiff did not receive a favorable verdict.

Types of litigants

*  In 54% of contract trials, the primary plaintiff litigant was an
individual. Businesses were plaintiffs in 44% of contract trials, while
government agencies and hospitals represented fewer than 5% of plaintiffs 
in contract trials.

*  Businesses were defendants in nearly two-thirds (62%) of contract trials
disposed of in the Nation's 75 largest counties, while individuals were
defendants in about a third (34%) of contract trials. Governments and
hospitals represented less than 5% of defendants in contract trials.

Litigant pairings and case outcomes

*  Individual plaintiffs prevailed in an estimated three-fifths of contract
trials where they sued an individual (59%) or business (60%) defendant. The
total median damage awards individual plaintiff winners received in these
contract trials was $31,000 and $50,000, respectively.

*  Non-individual plaintiffs (businesses, governments, and hospitals)
prevailed in nearly three-fourths of contract trials in which the defendant
was an individual (71%) or business (74%). The total median damage award for
non-individual plaintiff winners was $60,000 in contract trials involving a
business defendant and $20,000 in trials with an individual as defendant.
