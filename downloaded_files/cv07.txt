In 2007 U.S. residents experienced an estimated 23 
million violent and property victimizations, according 
to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). 
Criminal victimizations in 2007 included approximately 
5.2 million violent crimes and 17.5 million property crimes. 
The rates for every major violent and property crime 
measured by the NCVS in 2007 were at or near the 
lowest levels recorded since 1973, the first year that 
such data were available. ***Footnote 1: The discussion 
of victimization rate trends excludes NCVS estimates for 
2006 because of the methodological inconsistencies
between the data for that year and the data for other 
years.***

The overall victimization rate in 2007 for violent crimes 
was 20.7 per 1,000 persons, which was not significantly 
different from the 2005 rate of 21.1 per 1,000 persons 
(table 1). For property crimes, the overall rate of 146.5 
per 1,000 households in 2007 was somewhat lower than 
the rate of 154.2 per 1,000 households in 2005. As in
previous years, about half of the violent crimes and almost
two-thirds of the property crimes measured by the NCVS in
2007 were not reported to police.

NCVS is an annual data collection conducted by the 
U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
(BJS). This report provides the initial release of data for 
2007 from the NCVS.

This bulletin describes the substantial fluctuations in 
the survey measure of crime from 2005 through 2007. 
As discussed in the Technical Notes, these changes do 
not appear to be due to changes in the rate of criminal 
activity during this period. Evaluation of the NCVS 
estimates suggest that changes in the sample design 
and implementation of the survey account for the 
fluctuations in crime rates measured from 2005 to 2006 
and from 2006 to 2007. 

***Changes to the NCVS and their impact upon the
 survey's estimates in 2006 are discussed in the Criminal 
Victimization 2006 Technical Notes. This bulletin and 
technical notes are available online at:
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cv06.pdf>.***

BJS continues to work with the U.S. Census Bureau to 
better understand the impact of these changes upon survey 
estimates. Once the research is complete, BJS will publish 
a technical report to describe the findings. If adjustments
to the reported crime rates for 2006 and 2007 are warranted, 
or if other changes to the data are identified, BJS will
issue a revised report to provide users with a more
comparable set of figures. Based on research completed to
date, there is a high degree of confidence that survey
estimates for 2007 are consistent with and comparable to
those for 2005 and previous years.

While the estimates for 2007 are close to the levels for 
2005, they are substantially below the levels for 2006. 
Changes in 2006 included the introduction of a new sample 
based on the 2000 decennial census, a transition from 
paper-and-pencil interviewing (PAPI) to computer-assisted 
interviewing (CAPI), and the use of first-time interviews 
in the new sample areas in the production of survey 
estimates.

In 2007, three additional changes were made largely for 
budgetary reasons to the NCVS program:

*The sample was reduced by 14% in July 2007.

*First-time interviews from all sample areas were used 
in the production of 2007 estimates.

*Computer-assisted interviews from centralized 
telephone centers were discontinued in July 2007.

Analyses of the 2007 estimates indicate that the program 
changes made in 2007 had relatively small effects on 
NCVS estimates. As discussed in Criminal Victimization, 
2006, the substantial increases in victimization rates from 
2005 to 2006 do not appear to be due to actual changes in 
crime during that period. The increases were attributed to 
the impact of the methodological changes in the survey.
***Footnote 2 Users are encouraged to focus on the comparison 
between 2005 and 2007 victimization rates until the changes 
to the NCVS in 2006 are better understood.***

These effects were reversed in 2007, suggesting that the 
2006 findings represent a temporary anomaly in the data. 
The methodological changes implemented in 2007, their 
impact on the survey estimates, and the NCVS methodological 
research program are described more fully in the Technical 
Notes on page 7.

NCVS collects information from victims of nonfatal 
violent crimes and property crimes

The NCVS collects information on nonfatal crimes, reported
and not reported to the police, against persons age 12 or
older from a nationally representative sample of U.S.
households. It produces national rates and levels of personal
and property victimization. Information on homicide presented
in this report was obtained from the Uniform Crime Reporting
(UCR) program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Violent crimes measured by the NCVS include rape, sexual 
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault. 
Property crimes include household burglary, motor vehicle 
theft, and theft. The survey also measures personal theft, 
which includes pocket picking and purse snatching.

In 2007, 41,500 households and 73,600 individuals age 
12 or older were interviewed for the NCVS. Each household 
was interviewed twice during the year. The response rate 
was 90.3% of households and 86.2% of eligible individuals.

Violent and property victimization rates remain at 
historic lows in 2007

The 2007 violent crime rate was 43% lower than in 1998 
due to a decline in crime between 1998 and 2002 (figure 1). 
This rate has remained generally stable since 2003. Rates 
for robbery and simple assault followed similar patterns 
across the 10-year period. The crime rate for rape declined 
marginally between 1998 and 2007. For aggravated assault, 
the crime rate fell during both five-year periods, between
1998 and 2002 and between 2003 and 2007.

From 1998 to 2007, the rate of overall property crime fell by 
33% (figure 2). The property crime rate has had a longterm 
declining trend for most of the survey's 36-year history.

The overall rates for property crime and theft fell in both
the first and second half of the 10-year period, with a
greater decline from 1998 to 2002 than from 2003 to 2007. 
The burglary rate fell from 1998 to 2002 and also declined 
slightly from 2003 to 2007. For motor vehicle theft, the 
rate declined from 1998 to 2002 and has remained stable 
since 2003 (table 2).

Victimization rates in 2007 were near the levels 
experienced in 2005

The overall violent crime rate in 2007 was not statistically 
different from the rate in 2005. In comparison, the 2007 
property crime rate was marginally lower than the rate in 
2005. Of the violent crimes measured by the NCVS, aggravated 
assault was the only crime with a significantly lower rate in 
2007 than in 2005. The rate of victimization for overall
property crime and household burglary were somewhat lower in
2007, compared to 2005. 

Comparisons are made between the rates for 2005 and 
2007 because 2006 was an anomalous year due to the 
impact of the methodological changes introduced to the 
survey. A new sample introduced in 2006 affected the 
NCVS estimates in new areas, especially in non-urban 
areas. The new sample required hiring and training a large 
number of new interviewers in the new areas. The variation 
in the amount and rates of crime was too extreme to be 
attributed to actual year-to-year changes. These effects 
were reversed in 2007, suggesting that the 2006 findings 
represent a temporary anomaly in the data (table 3). See 
Technical Notes on page 7.

Characteristics of victims of violent crimes in 2007 
were similar to previous years 

As in previous years, males, blacks, and persons age 24 
or younger in 2007 continued to experience violent crime 
victimizations at higher or somewhat higher rates than 
females, whites, and persons age 25 or older (table 4). 

Gender of victims

Overall, males were victims of violent crime, robbery, and 
aggravated and simple assault at rates higher than females.
Females were more likely than males to be victims of rape or
sexual assault. Differences between male and female victims
of simple assault were not statistically significant.

Race of victim

Blacks were more likely than whites to be victims of 
robbery, and somewhat more likely than whites to be victims
of overall violence. Blacks were also more likely than 
persons of other races (American Indian, Alaska Native,
Asian, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander) to be
victims of overall violence, robbery, and aggravated and
simple assault.

Since 2003, survey respondents have been able to report 
more than one racial identity. In 2007, persons of two or 
more races were victims of violence at higher rates than 
blacks, whites, and persons of other races. 

Hispanic origin of victim

In 2007, there were no significant differences in the rates 
of victimization for overall violent crime and aggravated 
assault between Hispanics and non-Hispanics. Hispanics 
were more likely than non-Hispanics to be victims of 
robbery. Non-Hispanics had a somewhat higher rate of simple 
assault compared to Hispanics.

Age of victim

As in previous years, a general pattern of decreasing crime 
rates was observed in 2007 for persons in older age 
groups. For victims of violent crimes, persons age 12 to 15 
and age 16 to 19 were victimized at a significantly higher 
rate than persons in all other groups age 25 or older.
Persons age 16 to 19 also experienced higher violent crime 
rates than those age 20 to 24. Persons age 50 and older 
were victims of violent crime at lower rates than persons in 
younger age groups.

Rates for property crimes were higher in lower income 
households and large households

Rates of overall property crime were higher for lower 
income households compared to higher income households. 
Households earning less than $7,500 per year were victims 
of property crime at a rate that was about 1.5 times higher
than households earning $75,000 per year or more. 
Households earning less than $15,000 per year had higher 
property crime rates than households in all other income 
categories (table 5).

Patterns in the rates of household burglary and property 
theft were similar to that of overall property crime. 
Households in the two lowest income categories--less than 
$7,500 per year and $7,500 to $14,999 per year--were 
victims of burglary and theft at higher or marginally higher 
rates than households in all other income categories. For 
motor vehicle theft, there was no significant difference in 
the crime rate across most income categories. 

Property crime rates overall were higher for persons living 
in larger households than for those living in smaller house-
holds. Households with six or more persons were about 2.6 
times more likely to be victims of property crime than single 
person households. For property theft and motor vehicle 
theft, patterns across households of different sizes were 
similar to that of overall property crime. For household 
burglary, the rate for households with six or more persons
was higher than that for households in most other income
categories.

Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports, 
2005-2007 

Violent crime as measured by the FBI through 
the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) includes murder and 
non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and 
aggravated assault. Property crime includes burglary, 
larceny theft, and motor vehicle theft. UCR measures 
crimes reported  to the police, including commercial crimes.

The violent crime rate as measured by the UCR increased 
by 1% between 2005 and 2006 from 469 per 100,000 
persons to about 474.

*Between 2006 and 2007, the violent crime rate declined 
by 1.4% from about 474 per 100,000 persons to about 467.

*In 2007, the FBI reported 16,929 murders and non-
negligent manslaughters.

*Between 2006 and 2007, the homicide rate declined 
by about 1%, from 5.7 per 100,000 persons to 5.6.

*The property crime rate declined by 2.8% between 2005 
and 2006, from 3,432 per 100,000 persons to 3,335.

*Between 2006 and 2007, the property crime rate declined 
by 2.1%, from 3,335 per 100,000 persons to 3,264.

The general character of violent crime was unchanged 
in 2007

Historically, females have been most often victimized by 
someone they knew, while half or more of the crimes 
against males have been committed by strangers. Those 
general patterns continued in 2007. 

In 2007, males were equally likely to be victimized overall 
by a stranger or a nonstranger (table 6). Male victims of 
robbery and aggravated assault were more likely to be 
victimized by strangers. For simple assault, male victims
were more likely to have been victimized by someone they
knew.

Females who were victims of violence were more likely to 
be victimized by a nonstranger than by a stranger for all 
measured violent crimes, except robbery. Equal percentages 
of women reported that they were victims of robberies 
by strangers and nonstrangers (48%). 

About 623,000 violent crimes--554,000 against female 
victims and 69,000 against male victims--were committed 
by an intimate partner in 2007. The percentage of female 
victims (23%) of intimate partner violence was nearly 8 
times that of male victims (3%). 

An estimated 20% of all violent crime incidents were 
committed by an armed offender (table 7). As in previous 
years, the presence of a firearm was related to the type 
of crime. 

In 2007, 1% of rape or sexual assaults, 5% 
of assaults, and 25% of robberies were committed by 
an offender with a firearm.

Between 1998 and 2007, the overall rate of firearm 
violence declined from 3.0 to 1.6 victimizations per 1,000 
persons age 12 or older. In 2007, firearms were used in 7% 
of all violent crime incidents. Over the 10-year period,
about 7% to 9% of all violent crimes were committed by
offenders using firearms (not shown in table).

Nearly half of all violent victimizations were reported 
to the police in 2007

During 2007, 46% of all violent victimizations and 37% 
of all property crimes were reported to the police. The 
percentage of robberies (66%) reported to the police was 
higher than the percentage of rape or sexual assaults 
(42%) and simple assaults (41%).

Fifty percent of burglaries and 31% of household thefts 
were reported to the police. Motor vehicle theft (85%) was 
the property crime most frequently reported to the police.

Violent crimes against males (45%) and females (47%) 
were equally likely to be reported to the police in 2007. 
The same was true for property crimes for households headed 
by males and those headed by females (table 8).

Rates of reporting did not differ for males in different
racial groups. Violent crimes against black females were more 
likely to be reported to the police than such crimes against 
white females or females of other races. For both males 
and females, there were no differences among Hispanics 
and non-Hispanics in the likelihood of reporting violent 
crime to police.

Technical Notes

Changes implemented in the NCVS in 2007 had minor impacts on
estimates

Three changes were made to the NCVS for budgetary reasons in
2007:

*The sample was reduced by 14% beginning July 2007.

*To offset the impact of reducing the sample, first-time  
interviews (or bounding interviews) were used in the 
production of 2007 NCVS estimates. Adjustment factors 
were applied to the first-time interviews to counteract the 
effect of including unbounded interviews.

*In July 2007, computer assisted telephone interviews 
(CATI) from centralized interviewing centers were 
discontinued, and all interviewing was conducted by 
field interviewers using computer-assisted personal 
interviewing (CAPI). 

The U.S. Census Bureau undertook a number of analyses 
to determine the impact of the changes to the NCVS in 
2007. Initial reviews of processes and workload data 
uncovered no factors that would explain the overall 
year-to-year differences between the victimization 
rates for 2006 and 2007. 

Further analyses concentrated on three areas: the NCVS 
sample reduction implemented in July 2007, the bounding 
adjustment, and the elimination of CATI interviews in 
July 2007.

Victimization estimates in 2007 were relatively 
unaffected by the 14% sample reduction

The U.S. Census Bureau evaluated whether victimization 
rates for cases dropped from the NCVS sample in July 
were similar to cases that remained in the sample. 
Victimization rates from January to June 2007 were 
calculated for cases removed from the sample and for 
those that remained in sample.

The analysis determined that the sample reduction cases 
had nominally higher personal and property crime rates 
than those that remained in the sample. An overall 14% 
sample reduction was not large enough to explain the 
observed changes in victimization rates from 2006 to 2007.

Bounding adjustment effectively compensated for the 
impact of unbounded interviews

The NCVS uses a rotating panel design in which households 
remain in sample for three years. All residents age 12 
or older are interviewed at 6-month intervals for a total 
of seven interviews. As discussed more fully in the Criminal 
Victimization, 2006, Technical Notes, this panel design 
produces a time-in-sample effect on survey estimates.

Respondents tend to report more victimizations during 
first-time interviews than in subsequent interviews. 
In part, this is because respondents new to the survey 
tend to recall events as having taken place at a time
that was more recent than when they actually occurred.

To offset this bias, a bounding procedure in which first-time 
interviews are not included in the production of estimates 
has traditionally been used for the NCVS (i.e., seven 
interview rotations minus the bounding interview). Prior 
to 2006, victimizations reported during first-time 
interviews were used only to bound future interviews.

In July 2007, interviews with first-time households were 
used in the production of survey estimates to offset the 
impact of the 14% sample reduction. During the year, 
one-seventh of all sampled households were interviewed 
each month for the first time. Using first-time interviews 
to calculate victimization estimates helped to ensure that
the over-all sample size would remain consistent with
previous years. 

Without an adjustment for the time-in-sample effects of 
first-time interviews, including those households would 
have introduced an upward bias in the survey estimates. 
Weighting adjustments were developed to counteract an 
upward bias in the NCVS estimates in 2007. The 
adjustment process was similar to the one used in 2006 
to eliminate the impact of using first-time interviews 
in the incoming sample associated with the sample redesign.

Analyses of the 2007 estimates demonstrate that the 
bounding adjustment effectively countered the impact 
of including unbounded interviews (table 9). Estimates 
adjusted for the bounding or first-time interviews were 
virtually identical to the estimates produced using the 
second through seventh interviews.

Changes in the survey mode and sample redesign impacted
estimates to a greater extent in 2006 than in 2007 

The NCVS transitioned from a paper-and-pencil interview 
(PAPI) to a computer-assisted interview (CAPI) to become 
a fully automated data collection in July 2006. Interviews 
were completed by field representatives either by telephone 
or in person using questionnaires loaded into laptop
computers. 

Both before and after the transition, a substantial
proportion of interviews were conducted using
computer-assisted-telephone interviews (CATI) from two U.S.
Census Bureau telephone centers. CATI is a telephone survey
technique in which the interviewer follows a script provided
by a software application. From 2004 through 2006, the
percentage of sample cases interviewed using CATI declined
from about 30% to 15% of all interviews. 

Cases assigned to be interviewed by CATI were not random 
assignments. They were generally selected from primary 
sampling units (PSUs) with large numbers of sample 
cases. Cases assigned to CATI were considered easier to 
enumerate and were usually in urban and suburban areas. 
If a case could not be completed in CATI, it was returned to 
a field representative to attempt to complete the interview.

In July 2007, CATI as an interview technique was discontinued 
due to the cost and time involved to transfer cases to and
from the telephone centers. Beginning in the second half of
2007, all NCVS interviewing was conducted using  CAPI.
Analysis by the U.S. Census Bureau indicated that the
transition from PAPI to CAPI affected the 2006 personal crime
(violent crime and personal theft) rates. Those effects were
reduced in 2007 (figure 3). 

As standard practice, the U.S. Census Bureau updates its
sample areas for ongoing household surveys about middecade. 
To account for shifts in the population and household
locations that occur over time, a new sample was introduced
to the NCVS in 2006. Analysis of personal crime rates before
and after the sample redesign showed an extensive effect in
2006 and a reduced effect beginning April 2007. 

Personal crime rates for outgoing sample areas in 2005 
were generally lower than those in areas that continued in 
sample across the redesign. Incoming or new sample areas in
2006 generally had higher personal crime rates than
continuing areas. Not all differences measured quarterly--
January through March, April through June, July through
September, and October through December--were statistically
significant (figure 4). 

The transition from PAPI to CAPI as an interview technique 
affected the property crime rates in 2006. Those effects 
were reduced in 2007 (figure 5). In 2007, there was little 
evidence that the household crime rates for outgoing or 
incoming areas were different than the rates for continuing 
areas (figure 6). 

Analysis of the 2006 and 2007 estimates revealed interactions 
between survey mode and sample type (i.e., old versus new 
versus continuing). When CAPI interviewing was introduced
in July 2006, interviews conducted in incoming sample areas
produced much higher personal crime rates than CAPIinterviews
in continuing areas, an effect attributed to the impact of
new interviewers in the new sample areas. This effect
appeared to diminish in the second quarter, April to June
2007. In comparison, no such clear patterns were evident for
property crime rates when mode--PAPI, CATI, and CAPI--and
sample type were examined.

The transition from PAPI to CAPI and the effects of the 
sample redesign resulted in increases in crime rates in 
2006 and prevented comparing those NCVS estimates with 
earlier years. The effects were primarily in rural areas, 
which had a larger percentage than urban and suburban 
areas of incoming or new sample areas and outgoing 
areas.

The observed effects on the 2006 estimates diminished in 
2007. This decrease was consistent with the explanation 
that the selection of a new sample requires hiring and
training new interviewers to administer the survey during
every redesign. Interviewers new to the survey and the
training associated with the redesign resulted in higher
victimization rates being reported. 

The effects of the sample redesign and changes in the survey 
administration or mode in 2006 decreased in 2007. The NCVS 
estimates in 2007 are comparable to those in 2005 and earlier
years. 

BJS and the U.S. Census Bureau continue to examine 
the impact of methodological changes on survey estimates

Analyses undertaken by BJS and the U.S. Census Bureau 
established that the year-to-year 2005 to 2006 and 2006 to 
2007 NCVS estimates were not comparable as a result of 
the methodological changes introduced to the survey in 
2006. The apparent increase in victimization from 2005 to 
2006 has been largely attributed to implementing a new 
sample design, training interviewers new to the survey, and 
changing the mode of collecting the data.

These changes were most heavily felt in new sample areas 
in 2006, which were mainly rural areas. Data collected in 
those areas appeared to coincide with the greatest shifts in 
reported crime rates from 2005 to 2006. 

Urban and suburban areas surveyed in 2006 using both the 
old and new sample designs were designated as continuing 
areas. Estimates of violent and property crime did not 
change significantly from 2005 to 2006 in those continuing 
areas. In comparison, violent and property victimization 
rates in new areas--areas included in the new sample design 
only--increased greatly, compared to the old areas they
replaced.

The substantial changes in victimization estimates from 2005 
to 2006 and from 2006 to 2007 were too extreme to be 
attributable to actual year-to-year changes. Users should
focus on the comparison of the 2005 and 2007 rates until
these issues are resolved. It is emphasized that the impact
of the changes is on estimates of the extent and rates of
crime, not on the attributes of victims or crime incidents.
Based on research completed to date, the data for 2007 as
presented in this report are comparable with estimates for
2005 all previous years of the NCVS. 

Methodology

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an annual
data collection conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The NCVS collects
information on nonfatal crimes, reported and not reported to
the police, against persons age 12 or older  from a
nationally representative sample of U.S. households. 
Violent crimes measured by the NCVS include rape or sexual 
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault. 
Property crimes include household burglary, motor vehicle
theft, and theft.

The survey results in this report are based on data gathered 
from residents living throughout the United States, 
including persons living in group quarters, such as
dormitories, rooming houses, and religious group dwellings.
Armed Forces personnel living in military barracks and
institutional persons, such as correctional facility inmates,
were not included in the scope of this survey.

Each housing unit selected for the National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS) remains in the sample 
for three years, with each of seven interviews taking 
place at 6-month intervals. An NCVS field representative's
first contact with a household selected for the survey 
is in person. The field representative may conduct 
subsequent inter views by telephone. To elicit more 
accurate reporting of incidents, the NCVS uses a
self-respondent method that requires a direct interview 
with each person 12 years or older in the household.

Annual collection year estimates of the levels and rates 
of victimization are derived by accumulating estimates 
quarterly. The weights of all crimes reported during the 
interviews in that year are summed, regardless of when the 
crime occurred. The base for the collection year rate for 
personal crimes is the sum of all person weights. The base 
for the property crime rates is the sum of all household 
weights. For more detail, see Criminal Victimization in the 
United States, Statistical Tables, Methodology at <http://
www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cvusst.htm>. 

The NCVS sample was reduced by 14% in 2007 based 
on new budgetary constraints. To offset this reduction 
beginning with the 2006 NCVS, BJS included the data 
from the first interview in the production of estimates.

Earlier research conducted during the development of the 
NCVS found that persons often report crimes that occurred 
before the reference period. Prior to 2006, the first of
seven interviews was used to bound subsequent interviews 
and not in the production of NCVS estimates. The second
interview was the first data used in the analysis.

To reduce costs and leverage more of the data in 2006, 
and to account for the sample reduction in 2007, BJS 
applied a bounding adjustment to the first interview to 
nullify any over-reporting of crime. This allowed BJS to 
use the sur vey's full data collection. Further research 
showed that the bounding adjustment had no appreciable 
effect on the estimates. This change did not explain the 
fluctuation in the rates observed from 2005 through 2007. 

Comparisons of percentages and rates in this report 
were tested to determine if observed differences were 
statistically significant. Differences described as higher, 
lower, or different passed a test at the 0.05 level of
statistical significance (95%-confidence level). Differences
described as somewhat, slightly, marginally, or some
indication passed a test at the 0.10 level of statistical
significance (90%-confidence level). Caution is required when
comparing estimates not explicitly discussed in this
bulletin.
