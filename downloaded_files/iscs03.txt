FOREWORD

The Indicators of School Crime and Safety provides the most recent
national indicators on school crime and safety. These indicators
demonstrate that sizable improvements have occurred in the safety of
students: between 1992 and 2001, the violent crime victimization rate at
school declined from 48 violent victimizations per 1,000 students in
1992 to 28 such victimizations in 2001. Even so, violence, theft,
bullying, drugs, and firearms are still prevalent: students ages 12-18
were victims of about 764,000 violent crimes and 1.2 million crimes of
theft at school in 2001. 

Accurate information about the nature, extent, and scope of the problem
being addressed is essential in developing effective programs and
policies. The information in this report is intended to serve as a
foundation for policymakers and practitioners so that they can develop
effective programs and policies to prevent violence and crime in
schools and cope with it when it occurs.          

This is the sixth edition of Indicators of School Crime and Safety, a
joint publication of the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the National
Center for Education Statistics. This report provides detailed statistical
information to inform the nation on the current status of crime in
schools. The 2003 edition of Indicators includes the most recent
available data, including 2001 data and newly released data from the
2000 School Survey on Crime and Safety, a survey of our nation's
public schools. 

The data in this report were compiled from a number of statistical data
sources supported by the federal government. Such sources include
results from a study of violent deaths in schools, sponsored by the U.S.
Department of Education and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention; the National Crime Victimization Survey and School Crime
Supplement to the survey, sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics
and the National Center for Education Statistics, respectively; the
Youth Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention; and the Schools and Staffing Survey,
sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics. 

The entire report is available on the Internet. The Bureau of Justice
Statistics and the National Center for Education Statistics continue to
work toward providing more timely and complete data on the issues of
school-related violence and safety.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
For youth to fulfill their potential in school, schools should be safe and
secure places for all students, teachers, and staff members. Without a
safe learning environment, teachers may have difficulty teaching and
students may have difficulty learning. Gauging the safety of the school
environment, however, may be difficult given the large amount of
attention devoted to isolated incidents of extreme school violence
nationwide. 

Ensuring safer schools requires establishing good indicators of the
current state of school crime and safety across the nation and
periodically monitoring and updating these indicators. Indicators of
School Crime and Safety is designed to provide an annual snapshot of
specific crime and safety indicators, covering topics such as
victimization, fights, bullying, disorder, teacher injury, weapons,
student perceptions of school safety, and others. In addition to covering
a wide range of topics, the indicators are based on information drawn
from surveys of students, teachers, and principals, and data collections
by federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Students ages 12-18 were victims of about 2 million nonfatal crimes of
violence or theft at school in 2001, with the majority (62 percent) of all
victimizations at school being thefts. However, this report is not only
concerned with the safety of students in schools. Where comparable
data are available for crimes that occur outside of school grounds, these
data are offered as a point of comparison. In fact, as the data in this
report show, a larger number of serious violent victimizations (that is,
rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated assault) take place away
from school than at school.  Footnote 1: These data are not adjusted by
the number of hours that students spend on school property and the
number of hours they spend elsewhere. 

Data on homicides and suicides at school show there were 32
school-associated violent deaths in the United States between July 1,
1999 and June 30, 2000, including 24 homicides, 16 of which involved
school-aged children. In each school year from 1992 to 2000, youth
ages 5-19 were at least 70 times more likely to be murdered away from
school than at school.        

Trends in school crime over time are also of interest to researchers,
educators, and families. Data show that the percentage of students being
victimized at school has declined over recent years. Between 1995 and
2001, the percentage of students who reported being victims of crime at
school decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent. This included a decrease
in theft (from 7 percent to 4 percent) and a decrease in violent
victimization (from 3 percent to 2 percent) over the same time period. 

For some other types of crime at school, the frequency of these
behaviors has shown no detectable pattern of increase or decrease over
time. These include the percentage of suicides of school-age youth
between 1992 and 1999, the percentage of students being threatened or
injured with a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school property
between 1993 and 2001, and the percentage of teachers being
physically attacked by a student between 1993-94 and 1999-2000.
Hate-related graffiti between 1999 and 2001, and measures of
marijuana use, alcohol use, and drug distribution at school between
1993 and 2001 have also shown no detectable pattern of change over
their respective survey periods. 

The prevalence of one problem behavior at school has increased. In
2001, 8 percent of students reported that they had been bullied at school
in the last 6 months, up from 5 percent in 1999. 

ORGANIZATION OF THIS REPORT 

This report, the sixth in a series of annual reports on school crime and
safety from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National
Center for Education Statistics (NCES), presents the latest available
data on school crime and student safety. The report repeats some
indicators from the 2002 report and also provides updated data on
nonfatal student victimization; nonfatal victimization of teachers;
principal reports of select crimes; and principal reports of disciplinary
problems and actions at school. This year's report also includes data
from last year's Indicators on fatal student victimization and students'
reports of being threatened or injured with a weapon, being in fights,
being bullied, avoiding places, being called hate-related words, and
seeing hate-related graffiti. Data are also included on students'
perceptions of personal safety, gangs, carrying weapons at school, using
alcohol and marijuana, and drug availability on school property. 

The report is organized as a series of indicators, with each indicator
presenting data on a different aspect of school crime and safety. It starts
with a description of the most serious violence. There are five sections
to the report: Violent Deaths at School; Nonfatal Student
Victimization-Student Reports; Violence and Crime at School- Public
School Reports; Nonfatal Teacher Victimization at School-Teacher
Reports; and School Environment. Each section contains a set of
indicators that, taken together, describe a distinct aspect of school crime
and safety. 

Rather than relying on data from a large omnibus survey of school
crime and safety, this report uses a variety of independent data sources
from federal departments and agencies, including the BJS, NCES, and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Each data source has
an independent sample design, data collection method, and
questionnaire design. By combining multiple and independent sources
of data, this report aims to present a more complete portrait of school
crime and safety than would be possible using any single source of
information. 

However, because the report relies on so many data sets, the age
groups, time periods, and types of respondents analyzed can vary from
indicator to indicator. Readers should keep these variations in mind
when they compare data from different indicators. Readers should also
note that trends in the data are discussed when possible. Where trends
are not discussed, either the data are not available in earlier surveys or
survey question wording changed from year to year, eliminating the
ability to discuss any trend. Furthermore, while every effort has been
made to keep key definitions consistent across indicators, readers
should always use caution in making comparisons between results from
different data sets for several reasons: the data sets may contain
definitional differences, such as those used for specific crimes and
crimes that occur "at school," and respondent differences, such as
examining students who report a victimization (at the individual level)
and a school reporting one or more victimizations school wide.
Appendix A of this report contains descriptions of all the data sets used
in this report. 

KEY FINDINGS 

All the comparisons described in this report are statistically significant
at the 0.05 level. The following section presents the key findings of the
report: 

Violent Deaths at School 
From July 1, 1999 through June 30, 2000, 32 school-associated violent
deaths occurred in the United States (Indicator 1). Twenty-four of these
violent deaths were homicides and 8 were suicides. Sixteen of the 24
school-associated homicides involved school-aged children. These 16
homicides are relatively few (1 percent of all homicides of youth) when
comparing them with a total of 2,124 children ages 5-19 who were
victims of homicide in the United States over the same period. Six of
the 8 school-associated suicides from July 1, 1999 through June 30,
2000 involved school-aged children. Away from school, there were a
total of 1,922 suicides of children ages 5-19 during the 2000 calendar
year. 

Nonfatal Student Victimization-Student Reports 

Students ages 12-18 were more likely to be victims of nonfatal serious
violent crime-including rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated
assault-when they were away from school than at school (Indicator 2).
In 2001, students in this age range were victims of about 290,000
serious violent crimes away from school, compared with about 161,000
at school. 

     Between 1992 and 2001, the violent crime victimization rates
(that is, serious violent crime plus simple assault) for students ages
12-18 both at school and away from school decreased from 48 violent
crimes per 1,000 students in 1992 to 28 violent crimes per 1,000
students in 2001 (Indicator 2). While this trend indicates an overall
decline during this time frame, no difference was detected between
2000 and 2001 in the number of violent victimizations. 


In 2001, younger students (ages 12-14) were more likely to be
victimized at school than older students (ages 15-18); however, away
from school, older students were more likely to be victimized than their
younger counterparts (Indicator 2). 
     
The percentages of students in grades 9-12 who have been threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property2 have shown no measurable
differences in recent years (Indicator 4). In 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, and
2001, between 7 and 9 percent of students reported being threatened or
injured with a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school property
in the preceding 12 months. 

The percentage of students who reported being in a fight anywhere
declined between 1993 and 2001, from 42 percent to 33 percent
(Indicator 5). Similarly, the percentage of students who reported
fighting on school property also declined over this period, from 16
percent to 13 percent. 

In 2001, 8 percent of 12- through 18-year-old students reported being
bullied at school in the last 6 months, up from 5 percent in 1999
(Indicator 6). 

Both males and females were more likely to report being bullied in
2001 than in 1999 (Indicator 6). In 2001, males were more likely than
females to report being bullied (9 and 7 percent, respectively); however,
in 1999, no such difference could be detected (5 percent each). 


Violence and Crime at School-Public School Reports 
In 1999-2000, 20 percent of all public schools experienced one or more
serious violent crimes such as rape, sexual assault, robbery, and
aggravated assault. Seventy-one percent of schools reported at least one
violent incident. Forty-six percent of public schools reported property
crimes, or thefts (Indicator 7). This report also provides the number of
disciplinary actions taken by school principals for reasons not related to
academics. About 54 percent of public schools reported taking a serious
disciplinary action in the 1999-2000 school year. Of those disciplinary
actions, 83 percent were suspensions lasting 5 days or more, 11 percent
were removals with no services (i.e., expulsions), and 7 percent were
transfers to specialized schools (Indicator 8). 

Secondary schools were more likely than other schools to experience a
violent incident during the 1999-2000 school year (92 vs. 61-87 percent
for elementary, middle, and combined schools). Likewise, larger
schools were more likely to experience a violent incident than smaller
schools. About 89 percent of schools with 1,000 or more students
experienced a violent incident, compared with 61 percent of schools
with less than 300 students (Indicator 7). 

Footnote 2: Definitions for "on school property" and "at school" may
differ. See appendix B for specific definitions. 

Two percent of public schools took a serious disciplinary action for the
use of a firearm or explosive device, and  4 percent did so for the
possession of such a device (Indicator 8). 

Nonfatal Teacher Victimization at School-Teacher Reports 
Over the 5-year period from 1997 through 2001, teachers were victims
of approximately 1.3 million nonfatal crimes at school, including
817,000 thefts and 473,000 violent crimes (rape or sexual assault,
robbery, and aggravated and simple assault) (Indicator 9). 

From 1997 through 2001, senior high school and middle/junior high
school teachers were more likely to be victims of violent crimes (most
of which were simple assaults) than elementary school teachers
(Indicator 9). 
     
Teachers were differentially victimized by violent crimes at school
according to where they taught (Indicator 9). From 1997 through 2001,
urban teachers were more likely to be victims of violent crimes than
suburban and rural teachers. 

In the 1999-2000 school year, 9 percent of all elementary and secondary
school teachers were threatened with injury by a student, and 4 percent
were physically attacked by a student (Indicator 10). This represented
about 305,000 teachers who were victims of threats of injury by
students that year and 135,000 teachers who were victims of attacks by
students. 

School Environment 

Between 1995 and 1999, the percentage of students ages 12-18 who felt
unsafe while they were at school or on the way to and from school
decreased (Indicator 12). However, between 1999 and 2001, no change
was found in the percentage of students who felt unsafe. In both 1999
and 2001, students were more likely to be afraid of being attacked when
they were at school than away from school. 

Between 1993 and 2001, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who
reported carrying a weapon such as a gun, knife, or club on school
property within the previous 30 days declined from 12 percent to 6
percent (Indicator 11). 
     
Between 1999 and 2001, no differences were detected in the percentage
of students ages 12-18 who avoided one or more places at school (about
5 percent in each year) (Indicator 13). These estimates represented a
decrease from 1995, when 9 percent of students avoided places at
school. 

In 2001, 12 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that someone at
school had used hate-related words against them (Indicator 14). That is,
in the previous 6 months, someone at school had called them a
derogatory word related to race,  religion, ethnicity, disability, gender,
or sexual orientation. During the same period, about 36 percent of
students saw hate-related graffiti at school. 

In 2001, 20 percent of students reported that street gangs were present
at their schools (Indicator 15). Students in urban schools were more
likely to report the presence of street gangs at their schools (29 percent)
than were suburban and rural students (18 and 13 percent, respectively). 

In 1999-2000, public school principals were asked to report how often
certain disciplinary problems occurred at their schools. Twenty-nine
percent of public schools reported that student bullying occurred on a
daily or weekly basis and 19 percent reported student acts of disrespect
for teachers occurred at the same frequency (Indicator 16).

Additionally, 13 percent reported student verbal abuse of teachers and 3
percent reported occurrences of student racial tensions and widespread
disorder in the classrooms with the same frequency. 

Between 1993 and 2001, no consistent patterns of increase or decrease
were found in the percentage of students who had consumed alcohol,
both anywhere and on school property (Indicator 17). In 2001, 5 percent
of students in grades 9-12 had at least one drink of alcohol on school
property in the 30 days prior to the survey. Forty-seven percent of
students had at least one drink anywhere during the same period. 
     
Between 1993 and 2001, no consistent patterns of increase or decrease
were found in the percentage of students who had used marijuana-both
anywhere and on school property (Indicator 18). In 2001, 24 percent of
students reported using marijuana anywhere during the previous 30
days, and 5 percent reported using marijuana on school property. 

In 2001, 29 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported that someone
had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in
the 12 months prior to the survey (Indicator 19).

VIOLENT DEATHS AT SCHOOL

INDICATOR 1
VIOLENT DEATHS AT SCHOOL AND AWAY FROM SCHOOL 

In each school year from July 1, 1992 to June 30, 2000, youth ages 5-19
were at least 70 times more likely to be murdered away from school
than at school. Violent deaths in schools are tragic events that affect not
only the individuals and families directly involved, but also everyone in
the schools and communities where they occur. In the 2001-02 school
year, 17 school-aged youth were victims of a school-associated violent
death. In this indicator, a school-associated violent death is a homicide,
suicide, legal intervention (involving a law enforcement officer), or
unintentional firearm-related death in which the fatal injury occurred on
the campus of a functioning elementary or secondary school in the
United States. Deaths that occurred while the victim was on the way to
or from regular sessions at school, or while the victim was attending or
traveling to or from an official school-sponsored event, were also
considered a school-associated violent death. Victims of
school-associated violent deaths include students, staff members, and
other nonstudents. Data were drawn from a number of data sets to
enable comparisons of homicides and suicides at school and away from
school. Data for school-associated violent deaths during the 1999-2000
through 2000- 01 school years are preliminary. 

In the most recent school year for which data from all sources are
available, from July 1, 1999 to June 30, 2000, there were 32
school-associated violent deaths (table 1.1). Of these violent deaths, 24
were homicides and 8 were suicides. Sixteen of the homicides and 6 of
the suicides were of school-aged youth (ages 5-19) at school (figure 1.1
and table 1.1). Combined, this translates into less than 1 homicide or
suicide of a school-aged youth at school per million students enrolled
during the 1999-2000 school year.1 Away from school, during roughly
the same time period, there were 2,124 homicides and 1,922 suicides of
youth ages 5-19.         

From July 1, 1992 to June 30, 2000, 390 school-associated violent
deaths occurred on campuses of U.S. elementary or secondary schools.
Of these violent deaths, 234 were homicides and 43 were suicides of
school-aged youth (ages 5-19). Away from school during roughly the
same period,2 24,406 children ages 5-19 were victims of homicide and
16,735 children committed suicide. In each school year, youth were at
least 70 times more likely to be murdered away from school than at
school. 

Between July 1, 1992 and June 30, 1998, no consistent pattern of
increase or decrease was observed in the number of homicides or
suicides of school-aged youth at school (figure 1.2 and table 1.1).
During this period, between 28 and 34 homicides and between 1 and 7
suicides of school-aged youth occurred at school in each year.
However, from July 1, 1998 to This indicator has been updated to
include the most recent data available. 

June 30, 2002, there has been a decline in the number of homicides at
school, from 33 homicides of youth at school during the 1998-99 school
year, to 14 during the 2001-2002 school year. 

Footnote 1:  The total number of students in grades K-12 enrolled
during the Fall of the 1999 school year was 52,020,000 (U.S.
Department of Education 2003). 
Footnote 2:  The estimates include homicides of youth ages 5-19
occurring from July 1, 1992 to June 30, 2000 and suicides of youth ages
5-19 occurring from 1993 to 2000 calendar years. 

NONFATAL STUDENT VICTIMIZATION--STUDENT REPORTS

INDICATOR 2
VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL AND AWAY FROM SCHOOL
 
Between 1992 and 2001, the victimization rate for students ages 12-18
generally declined for thefts, violent crimes, and serious violent crimes
at school and away from school. 

Theft and violence at school and while going to and from school can
lead to a disruptive and threatening environment, physical injury, and
emotional stress and can be an obstacle to student achievement (Elliott,
Hamburg, and Williams 1998). Data from the National Crime
Victimization Survey show that students ages 12-18 were victims of
about 2 million nonfatal crimes (theft plus violent crime) while they
were at school and about  1.7 million crimes while they were away
from school in 2001 (tables 2.1 and 2.3).3 These figures represent
victimization rates of 73 crimes per 1,000 students at school, and 61
crimes per 1,000 students away from school (figure 2.1 and tables 2.2
and 2.4). 

Students ages 12-18 were more likely to be victims of theft at school
than away from school between 1992 and 2001, in all but 2 years (1997
and 2000) (tables 2.1 and 2.3). In 2001, about 1.2 million thefts
occurred at school, and about 913,000 occurred away from school. In
2001, students ages 12-18 were victims of about 764,000 violent crimes
at school (rape, sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple
assault), including 161,000 serious violent crimes (rape, sexual assault,
robbery and aggravated assault). Away from school, students were
victims of about 758,000 violent crimes, including 290,000 serious
violent crimes. Although during most of the period between 1992 and
2001, the victimization rates for violent crime and serious violent crime
were lower at school than away from school, no difference could be
detected in the violent victimization rate for students at school and
away from school in 2001. 

The victimization rate for students ages 12-18 generally declined for
thefts, violent crimes, and serious violent crimes at school and away
from school between 1992 and 2001 (figure 2.1 and tables 2.2 and 2.4).
Specifically, the violent victimization rate generally declined between
1992 and 2001 from 48 to 28 crimes per 1,000 students at school and
from 71 to 28 crimes per 1,000 students away from school.  While this
trend indicates an overall decline during this time frame, no difference
was detected between 2000 and 2001 in the number of violent
victimizations. 

In 2001, the rate of serious violent crime away from school was higher
for urban students than for both suburban and rural students (figures 2.2
and 2.3, and tables 2.2 and 2.4). However, no differences were detected
in the likelihood of theft, violent victimization, and serious violent
victimization at school between students living in urban, suburban, and
rural areas. Younger students (ages 12-14) were more likely than older
students (ages 15-18) to be victims of crime at school while older
students were more likely than  older students (ages 15 18) to be
victims of crime at school while older students were more likely than
younger students to be victimized away from school. No differences
could be detected in the rate of theft, violent victimization, and serious
violent victimization between males and females both at school and
away from school. 

Footnote 3: "Students" refers to persons 12-18 years of age who
reported being in any elementary or secondary grade at the time of the
survey. An uncertain percentage of these persons may not have attended
school during the survey reference period. These data do not take into
account the number of hours that students spend at school and the
number of hours they spend away from school. 


INDICATOR 3
VICTIMIZATION OF STUDENTS AT SCHOOL 
 
In recent years, as student grade level increased from 6th to 12th,
reports of victimization generally decreased. The most frequently
occurring type of nonfatal crime in the United States is theft, though
violent crime continues to be of importance in examining school safety
(U.S. Department of Justice 2000). Data from the School Crime
Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey show a
decrease in the percentage of students affected by most types of
victimization in recent years. For example, the percentage of students
ages 12-18 who reported being victims of nonfatal crimes at school
during the previous 6 months was lower in 2001 than in 1999 and 1995
(6 percent vs. 8 and 10 percent, respectively) (table 3.1). Student reports
of theft at school decreased from 7 percent in 1995 to 4 percent in 2001.
In addition, student reports of violence at school decreased from 1995
to 1999 but were not measurably different between 1999 and 2001 (3
percent in 1995 and 2 percent in both 1999 and 2001). 

In 2001, male students were more likely than female students to report
any criminal victimization (6 vs. 5 percent). Among 6th-12th-grade
students, as student grade level increased, reports of victimization
generally decreased in all survey years (figure 3.1 and table 3.1).
Nonetheless, for students in each grade level, the percentage who
reported being victims of nonfatal crimes declined between 1995 and
2001. During this period, reports of victimization dropped from 10
percent to 6 percent for 6th-graders and from 6 percent to 3 percent for
12th-graders. 

Nonfatal victimization rates varied according to school sector. In each
survey year, public school students were more likely to report having
been victims of violent crime than their private school counterparts.
Public school students were also more likely than private school
students to report being victims of theft in 1995 and 2001. 
This indicator repeats information from the 2002 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report. 


INDICATOR 4
THREATS AND INJURIES WITH WEAPONS ON SCHOOL
PROPERTY 

The percentage of students in grades 9-12 who were threatened or
injured with a weapon on school property has fluctuated in recent years
without a clear trend. Every year, some students are threatened or
injured with a weapon while they are on school property. The
percentage of students victimized in this way provides an important
measure of how safe our schools are and how this changes over time. In
the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked
whether they had been threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property during the 12 months preceding the survey. Results show that
the percentage of students who were threatened or injured in this way
has fluctuated in recent years without a clear trend. In all survey years
from 1993 to 2001, between 7 percent and 9 percent of students
reported being threatened or injured with a weapon, such as a gun,
knife, or club, on school property (table 4.1). 

The likelihood of being threatened or injured with a weapon on school
property varied by student characteristics. In each survey year, males
were more likely than females to report being threatened or injured with
a weapon on school property (figure 4.1 and table 4.1). For example, in
2001, 12 percent of male students reported being threatened or injured
in the past year, compared with 7 percent of female students. Among
9th-12th-grade students, those in lower grades were more likely to be
threatened or injured with a weapon on school property than were those
in higher grades in all survey years (figure 4.2 and table 4.1). In 2001,
13 percent of 9th-graders reported that they were threatened or injured
with a weapon on school property, compared with 9 percent of
10th-graders, 7 percent of 11th-graders, and 5 percent of 12th-graders. 
Finally, students' likelihood of being threatened or injured with a
weapon on school property was examined by race/ethnicity. In 2001,
Pacific Islander students were more likely than Black, Hispanic, or
White students to report being threatened or injured with a weapon on
school property. While there appear to be large differences in other
racial/ ethnic groups, some of these estimates are associated with large
standard errors and should be interpreted with caution. 


INDICATOR 5
PHYSICAL FIGHTS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY 

In recent years, the percentage of 9th-12th-grade students who reported
being in a physical fight on school property has declined-from 16
percent in 1993 to 13 percent in 2001. 

Schools at which there are numerous physical fights may not be able to
maintain a focused learning environment for students. Further, students
who are involved in fights on school property may have difficulty
succeeding in their studies (Hamburg 1998). In the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked about their
general involvement in physical fights during the preceding 12 months
(referred to as "anywhere" in this analysis) and their involvement in
physical fights on school property. The percentage of students in grades
9-12 who reported being in a fight anywhere declined from 1993 to
2001-from 42 percent in 1993 to 33 percent in 2001 (table 5.1).
Similarly, the percentages of students who reported fighting on school
property in these years also declined, from 16 percent in 1993 to 13
percent in 2001. 

In all survey years, males were more likely than females to have been in
a fight anywhere and on school property (figure 5.1 and table 5.1). In
2001, 43 percent of males said they had been in a fight anywhere, and
18 percent said they had been in a fight on school property. In that same
year, 24 percent of females reported they had been in a fight anywhere,
and 7 percent said they had been in a fight on school property. When
looking at different grade levels, students in lower grades reported
being in fights more frequently than students in higher grades both
anywhere and on school property in all survey years (figure 5.2 and
table 5.1). For example, in 2001, 17 percent of 9th-graders reported
being in a fight on school property, while 8 percent of 12th-graders
reported the same. 

In 2001, the percentages of students engaging in fights anywhere varied
according to students' race/ethnicity. Specifically, Asian students were
less likely than Black, White, and Hispanic students to report being in a
fight anywhere (22 percent vs. 32-37 percent for Black, White, and
Hispanic students). However, a similar pattern could not be detected in
the percentages of students who reported being in a fight at school.
While there appear to be large differences in other racial/ethnic groups,
these estimates are associated with large standard errors and should be
interpreted with caution. 


INDICATOR 6
BULLYING AT SCHOOL 

The percentage of students who reported that they had been bullied at
school increased from 5 percent in 1999 to 8 percent in 2001. Bullying
can contribute to an environment of fear and intimidation in schools
(Arnette and Walsleben 1998; Ericson 2001). In the School Crime
Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages
12-18 were asked if they had been bullied (for example, picked on or
made to do things they did not want to do) at school. In 2001, 8 percent
of students reported that they had been bullied at school in the last 6
months, up from 5 percent in 1999 (table 6.1). 

In 2001, males were more likely than females to be bullied (9 vs. 7
percent); however, no differences could be detected according to
students' sex in 1999 (about 5 percent each) (figure 6.1 and table 6.1).
The percentage of students who reported that they had been bullied
increased between 1999 and 2001 for all racial/ethnic groups except
Blacks. About 6 percent of Black students in both years reported they
had been bullied. During this period, the percentage of students who
had been bullied increased from 5 to 9 percent for White students, and
from 4 to 8 percent for Hispanic students. In 2001, one difference could
be detected among racial/ethnic groups in the percentage of students
who reported being bullied: White students were more likely than Black
students to report being bullied (9 vs. 6 percent). 

In 1999 and 2001, grade level was inversely related to students'
likelihood of being bullied: as grade level increased, students'
likelihood of being bullied decreased (figure 6.2 and table 6.1). For
example, in 2001, 14 percent of 6th-graders, 9 percent of 9thgraders,
and 2 percent of 12th-graders reported that they had been bullied at
school. 

In 1999, public school students were more likely to report being bullied
than private school students (5 vs. 3 percent); however, no differences
were detected between public and private school students' reports of
being bullied in 2001. 

This indicator repeats information from the 2002 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report. 

VIOLENCE AND CRIME AT SCHOOL-PUBLIC SCHOOL
REPORTS

INDICATOR 7
VIOLENT AND OTHER INCIDENTS AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND
THOSE REPORTED TO THE POLICE 

Seventy-one percent of public schools experienced one or more violent
incidents, while 36 percent reported one or more such incidents to the
police. This indicator provides the percentage of schools that
experienced one or more crimes and the total number of crimes reported
by schools. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, principals of
public schools were asked to provide the number of violent incidents,
serious violent incidents, thefts, and other incidents that occurred at
their school, as well as the number of incidents that were reported to the
police. Violent incidents include rape, sexual battery other than rape,
physical attack or fight with or without a weapon, threat of physical
attack with or without a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. 

In 1999-2000, an estimated 1.5 million violent incidents occurred in
public elementary and secondary schools (table 7.1). Seventy-one
percent of public schools experienced one or more violent incidents and
36 percent of schools reported one or more such incidents to the police
(tables 7.1 and 7.2). Twenty percent of schools experienced one or more
serious violent incidents (which are a subset of violent incidents and
include rape, sexual battery other than rape, physical attack or fight
with a weapon, threat of physical attack with a weapon, and robbery
with or without a weapon) and 46 percent of public schools experienced
one or more thefts. These translate into an estimated 61,000 serious
violent incidents and 218,000 thefts at public schools in 1999-2000.
When looking at reports to police, 15 percent of public schools reported
one or more serious violent incidents to the police and 28 percent
reported one or more thefts to the police. 

The prevalence of violent incidents and those reported to the police
varied by the school level and size of the school (figures 7.1 and 7.2
and tables 7.1 and 7.2). Schools with students in higher grades were
more likely to experience a violent incident than those with students in
lower grades. Specifically, secondary schools were more likely to have
a violent incident than elementary, middle, or combined schools (92
percent vs. 61-87 percent for the other school levels). A similar pattern
was observed for those incidents that were reported to the authorities:
71 percent of secondary schools reported a violent incident, compared
with 20 percent of elementary schools, 56 percent of middle schools,
and 51 percent of combined schools. Likewise, larger schools were
more likely to have a violent incident and report one or more violent
incidents to the police than smaller schools. About 89 percent of
schools with 1,000 students or more had a violent incident, compared
with 61 percent of schools with less than 300 students. 
This is a new indicator. 

When examining violent incidents by the location of public schools,
city schools were more likely than urban fringe schools to experience or
report to the police at least one violent incident during the 1999-2000
school year (figure 7.3 and tables 7.1 and 7.2). Seventy-seven percent
of urban schools had one or more violent incidents and 44 percent
reported one or more incidents to the police, compared with 67 and 35
percent, respectively, of urban fringe schools. Rural schools were the
least likely to report one or more violent incidents to the police (28
percent vs. 35-44 percent for public schools in urban fringe and city
areas). 

INDICATOR 8
SERIOUS DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS TAKEN BY PUBLIC
SCHOOLS

About 54 percent of public schools took a serious disciplinary action in
the 1999- 2000 school year. Of those disciplinary actions, 83 percent
were suspensions lasting 5 days or more, 11 percent were removals
with no services (i.e., expulsions), and 7 percent were transfers to
specialized schools. 

The extent to which schools remove students from regular instruction as
a result of crime and violence has important consequences for student
instruction. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, public school
principals were asked to report the number of disciplinary actions taken
during the 1999-2000 school year for specific offenses that were not
academic infractions. 

About 54 percent of public schools took at least one serious disciplinary
action, including suspensions lasting 5 days or more, removals with no
services (i.e., expulsions), and transfers to specialized schools, for any
of the offenses that occurred in the 1999-2000 school year (table 8.1).
Altogether, about 1,163,000 actions were taken. Of those serious
disciplinary actions, 83 percent were suspensions for 5 days or more, 11
percent were removals with no services, and 7 percent were transfers to
specialized schools (figure 8.1 and table 8.1). 

Two percent of all public schools took one or more serious disciplinary
actions in response to the use of a firearm or explosive device, and 4
percent did so for the possession of such a device (figure 8.2 and table
8.1). Use of weapons other than firearms resulted in at least one serious
disciplinary action in 5 percent of schools, while possession of weapons
other than firearms led to a serious disciplinary action in 19 percent of
schools. 

Ten percent of all public schools took one or more serious disciplinary
actions for the distribution of illegal drugs, and 20 percent for the
possession or use of illegal drugs or alcohol. In 1999-2000, public
schools took serious disciplinary actions for offenses such as fights (35
percent), threats (22 percent), insubordination (18 percent), and other
nonacademic infractions (14 percent). 

This is a new indicator. 


NONFATAL TEACHER VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL-TEACHER
REPORTS

INDICATOR 9
NONFATAL TEACHER VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL 

From 1997 to 2001, teachers were the victims of approximately 1.3
million nonfatal crimes at school, including 817,000 thefts and 473,000
violent crimes. Students are not the only victims of crime at school.
Teachers are also targets of violence and theft in schools. In addition to
the personal toll that violence may take on teachers, those who worry
about their safety may have difficulty teaching and may leave the
profession altogether (Elliott, Hamburg, and Williams 1998).

Information on the number of crimes against teachers at school can help
show the extent of the problem. Estimates of teacher victimization are
drawn from the National Crime Victimization Survey, which obtains
information about the occupation of survey respondents. These events
are not limited to offenses committed by students; offenses committed
by others against teachers at school are also included. 

Over the 5-year period from 1997 to 2001, teachers were the victims of
approximately 1.3 million nonfatal crimes at school, including 817,000
thefts and 473,000 violent crimes (rape or sexual assault, robbery,
aggravated assault, and simple assault) (table 9.1). Among the violent
crimes against teachers during this 5-year period, there were about
48,000 serious violent crimes (accounting for 10 percent of the violent
crimes), including rape or sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated
assault. On average, these figures translate into a rate of 21 violent
crimes per 1,000 teachers, and 2 serious violent crimes per 1,000
teachers annually.
 
During the 5-year period, the annual rate of violent victimization for
teachers varied according to their sex and their instructional level
(figure 9.1 and table 9.1). Over the 5year period from 1997 to 2001,
male teachers were more likely than female teachers to be victims of
violent crimes (39 vs. 16 crimes per 1,000 teachers). Also, senior high
school and middle/junior high school teachers were more likely than
elementary school teachers to be victims of violent crimes (31 and 33
vs. 12 violent crimes per 1,000 teachers, respectively). 

Teachers in urban areas were more vulnerable to violent crime
victimization at school than others. For example, annually over the
5-year period, urban teachers were more likely than rural and suburban
teachers to be victims of violent crimes (28 vs. 13 and 16 crimes,
respectively, per 1,000 teachers). Teachers in urban areas were more
likely than those in rural areas to experience theft at school (42 and 26
crimes per 1,000 teachers, respectively). 

This indicator has been updated to include 2001 data.
 
Footnote 4: The average annual rate is the sum of all teacher
victimizations across the 5 years divided by the sum of all teachers over
those years, multiplied by 1,000. 


INDICATOR 10
TEACHERS THREATENED WITH INJURY OR ATTACKED BY
STUDENTS 
Teachers in central city schools were more likely than their peers in
urban fringe or rural schools to be threatened with injury or physically
attacked. Some of the offenses against teachers are committed by
students. Data on the extent to which students make threats or
physically attack elementary and secondary teachers can provide a
snapshot of this problem. In the Schools and Staffing Survey, teachers
were asked whether they had been threatened with injury or physically
attacked by a student in the previous 12 months. The survey results
indicate that a smaller percentage of elementary and secondary school
teachers were threatened with injury by a student at their school in the
1999-2000 school year than in the 1993-94 school year (9 vs. 12
percent) (table 10.1). No difference was detected in the percentage of
teachers physically attacked by a student in the 1999-2000 school year
compared to the 1993-94 school year (4 percent) (table 10.2). 

In 1999-2000, few differences could be detected in the likelihood of
teachers being victimized by students according to teachers'
race/ethnicity (tables 10.1 and 10.2). One such difference was that
Black teachers were more likely to be threatened than White teachers in
1999-2000 (12 vs. 9 percent). 

In both survey years, teachers in central city schools were more likely
to be threatened with injury or physically attacked than teachers in
urban fringe or rural schools (figure 10.1 and tables 10.1 and 10.2). For
example, in 1999-2000, 11 percent of teachers in central city schools
had been threatened with injury by students, compared with 8 percent
each in urban fringe and rural schools. Five percent of teachers in
central city schools had been attacked by students, while 3 percent each
of teachers in urban fringe and rural schools had experienced such
attacks. 

In 1999-2000, teachers' reports of being victimized or attacked by a
student varied according to the level and sector of their school.
Secondary school teachers were more likely than elementary school
teachers to have been threatened with injury by a student (10 vs. 8
percent); however, secondary school teachers were less likely to have
been physically attacked (2 vs. 6 percent). Public school teachers were
more likely than private school teachers to be victimized by students in
school (figure 10.2 and tables 10.1 and 10.2): 10 percent of public
school teachers had been threatened with injury, compared with 4
percent of private school teachers. Likewise, 4 percent of public school
teachers and 2 percent of private school teachers had been physically
attacked by students. Among This indicator  teachers in central city
schools, those at public schools were four times more likely to be  
repeats  targets of threats of injury than their colleagues in private
schools (14 vs. 3 percent) and  information from  about three times
more likely to be targets of attacks (6 vs. 2 percent).

SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT


INDICATOR 11
STUDENTS CARRYING WEAPONS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY 

Between 1993 and 2001, the percentage of students in grades 9-12 who
reported carrying a weapon anywhere and at school declined. The
presence of weapons at school can create an intimidating and
threatening atmosphere, making teaching and learning difficult
(Ingersoll and LeBoeuf 1997). The percentage of students who report
that they carry a gun or other weapon on school property is an indicator
of the breadth of the problem of weapons at school. In the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, students were asked if they had carried a weapon such
as a gun, knife, or club in the past 30 days (referred to as "anywhere" in
this analysis) or carried one of these weapons onto school property in
the past 30 days. In 2001, 17 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported
they had carried a weapon anywhere, and about 6 percent reported they
had carried a weapon on school property (table 11.1). 

Between 1993 and 2001, the percentage of students who reported
carrying a weapon anywhere generally declined from 22 to 17 percent.
Similarly, the percentage of students who carried a weapon at school
also declined during this period-from 12 to 6 percent. 

When looking at the types of students who carried weapons to school,
the survey results show that in all years, males were at least two times
more likely than females to carry a weapon-both anywhere and on
school property (figure 11.1 and table 11.1). For example, in 2001, 10
percent of males carried a weapon on school property, compared with 3
percent of females. 

For most survey years, the likelihood of students reporting that they
carried a weapon anywhere was inversely related to their grade level:
students in lower grades were more likely to report that they did so than
their peers in higher grades in all survey years except in 1999, at which
time no such relationship was found (figure 11.2 and table 11.1).
However, no consistent pattern could be detected by grade level for
students who reported carrying a weapon at school in almost all of the
survey years. 

In 2001, there were some differences in the percentages of students
carrying weapons anywhere and on school property according to
students' race/ethnicity. Although there appear to be large differences in
the prevalence of carrying weapons among students of various
racial/ethnic groups, some of these estimates are associated with large
standard errors and should be interpreted with caution. 
This indicator repeats information from the 2002 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report. 


INDICATOR 12
STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF PERSONAL SAFETY AT
SCHOOL OR ON THE WAY TO AND FROM SCHOOL AND
AWAY FROM SCHOOL 

In both 1999 and 2001, students were more likely to be afraid of being
attacked at school or on the way to and from school than away from
school. School violence can make students fearful and affect their
readiness and ability to learn. Concerns about vulnerability to attacks
also have a detrimental effect on the school environment (Elliott,
Hamburg, and Williams 1998). In the School Crime Supplement to the
National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages 12-18 were asked
how often they were afraid of attack "at school or on the way to and
from school" and "away from school" during the previous 6 months. 
Footnote 5: In 1995 and 1999, students reported fear of "attack or
harm" at school or on the way to and from school during the previous 6
months. In 2001, students reported fear of "attack or threat of attack" at
school or on the way to and from school during the previous 6 months.
Includes students who reported that they sometimes or most of the time
feared being victimized in this way.  Between 1999 and 2001, there was
no change detected in the percentage of students who felt unsafe at
school or on the way to and from school (table 12.1). However,
between 1995 and 1999, there was a decrease in the percentage of
students who felt unsafe. In 2001, 6 percent of students ages 12-18
reported that they sometimes or most of the time were fearful about
their safety at school compared with 12 percent in 1995. Away from
school in 2001, 5 percent of students feared being attacked. 

In both 1999 and 2001, Black and Hispanic students were more likely
than White students to fear for their safety at school or on the way to
and from school and away from school (figures 12.1 and 12.2 and table
12.1). In all survey years, students in lower grades were generally more
likely than students in higher grades to fear such attacks at school or on
the way to and from school. For example, in 2001, 11 percent of
6th-graders, 6 percent of 9th-graders, and 3 percent of 12th-graders
feared for their safety at school or on the way to and from school. 
The location of the school was also related to the extent to which
students feared attack: students in urban schools were more likely than
students in suburban and rural schools to fear being attacked at school
or on the way to and from school in all three survey years. In the most
recent survey year, 10 percent of students in urban schools feared being
attacked at school, compared with 5 percent of their counterparts in
suburban and 6 percent in rural schools. 

This indicator repeats information from the 2002 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report. 




INDICATOR 13
STUDENTS' REPORTS OF AVOIDING PLACES IN SCHOOL 

In 2001, 6th-grade students and urban students were more likely to
avoid places in school than 12th-grade students and students from
suburban and rural areas, respectively. 

School crime may lead students to perceive specific areas at school as
unsafe. In trying to ensure their own safety, they begin to avoid these
areas (Ingersoll and LeBoeuf 1997). Changes in the percentage of
students avoiding certain areas in school may be a good barometer of
how safe schools are, at least in the minds of those who attend them. In
the School Crime Supplement to the National Crime Victimization
Survey, students ages 12- 18 were asked whether they had avoided
certain places in school-such as the entrance, any hallways or stairs,
parts of the cafeteria, restrooms, and other places inside the school
building-during the previous 6 months. This indicator provides
estimates of those students who responded that they avoided at least
one of these places. 

No difference could be detected in the percentage of students who
avoided one or more places in school between 1999 and 2001 (5
percent in both years) (table 13.1). Between 1995 and 1999, the
percentage of students ages 12-18 who avoided one or more places in
school decreased from 9 to 5 percent. 

In all survey years, both Black and Hispanic students were more likely
than White students to report avoiding specific places in school (figure
13.1 and table 13.1). In 2001, for example, 4 percent of White students
reported avoiding certain areas, compared with 7 percent of Black
students and 6 percent of Hispanic students. 

In the most recent survey year, students' avoidance of certain places in
school differed according to their grade level and the location of their
school. Grade level was inversely associated with the likelihood of
avoiding places at school. In 2001, 7 percent of 6thgraders and 3
percent of 12th-graders avoided certain areas in school. In the same
year, students in urban areas were the most likely to avoid specific
places in school (figure 13.2 and table 13.1): 6 percent of urban
students reported that they had done so, compared with 4 percent each
of suburban and rural students. 

This indicator repeats information from the 2002 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report. 


INDICATOR 14
STUDENTS' REPORTS OF BEING CALLED HATE-RELATED
WORDS AND SEEING HATE-RELATED GRAFFITI 

In 2001, 12 percent of students ages 12-18 reported that someone at
school had used hate-related words against them, and more than
one-third of students (36 percent) saw hate-related graffiti at school. 

A student's exposure to hate-related words or symbols at school may
increase that student's feeling of vulnerability. Discriminatory behavior
in schools can create a hostile environment that is not conducive to
learning (McLaughlin and Brilliant 1997). In the School Crime
Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages
12- 18 were asked if someone at school called them a derogatory word
having to do with race, religion, ethnicity, disability, gender, or sexual
orientation during the previous 6 months. In the 2001 administration of
the survey, they were then asked to specify the characteristic to which
the hate-related word was directed. In 2001, 12 percent of students ages
12-18 reported that someone at school had used hate-related words
against them (figure 14.1 and table 14.1). Four percent of respondents
reported that the hate-related words concerned their race, about 3
percent each reported that the hate-related words concerned their
ethnicity or gender, and between 1 and 2 percent each reported that the
words were related to their religion, disability, or sexual orientation. 
Students were also asked if they had seen hate-related graffiti at their
school-that is, hate-related words or symbols written in classrooms,
bathrooms, hallways, or on the outside of the school building. In both
1999 and 2001, more than one-third (36 percent) of students saw
hate-related graffiti at school (table 14.2). 

In 2001, there were differences across sex and race/ethnicity in students'
experience being called specific types of hate-related words (tables 14.1
and 14.2). For example, females were more likely to report
gender-related hate words than males (4 percent of females vs. 1
percent of males). Whites were less likely to report race-related hate
words than students of other race/ethnicities (3 percent of Whites
compared to 8 percent of Blacks, 5 percent of Hispanics, and 10 percent
of students of other races). 

Students in public schools were more likely than students in private
schools to report being called hate-related words or seeing hate-related
graffiti in 2001. Specifically, public school students were more likely to
report exposure to hate words related to their race, ethnicity, or
disability. 


This indicator repeats information from the 2002 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report. 


INDICATOR 15
STUDENTS' REPORTS OF GANGS AT SCHOOL 

In 2001, students ages 12-18 in urban schools were the most likely to
report the presence of street gangs at their school, followed by suburban
students and rural students. 

Street gangs are organized groups that are often involved in drugs,
weapons trafficking, and violence. The presence of street gangs in
school can be very disruptive to the school environment because they
may not only create fear among students but also increase the level of
violence in school (Laub and Lauritsen 1998). In the School Crime
Supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey, students ages
12-18 were asked if street gangs are present in their schools. In 2001,
20 percent of students reported that there were gangs at their schools
(table 15.1). Students in urban schools were the most likely to report the
presence of street gangs at their school (29 percent), followed by
suburban students and rural students, who were the least likely to do so
(18 and 13 percent, respectively). 

Hispanic and Black students were more likely than White students to
report the existence of street gangs in their schools in 2001 (32 and 29
percent, respectively, vs. 16 percent). This pattern also held among
students in urban schools and suburban schools. Students in public
schools were more likely to report the presence of street gangs than
students in private schools (figure 15.1 and table 15.1). In 2001, 22
percent of students in public schools reported that there were street
gangs in their schools, compared with 5 percent in private schools. 
This indicator repeats information from the 2002 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report. 



INDICATOR 16
DISCIPLINE PROBLEMS REPORTED BY PUBLIC SCHOOLS 

In 1999-2000, more than one-quarter (29 percent) of public schools
reported daily or weekly student bullying. Discipline problems in a
school may contribute to an overall environment in which violence and
crime may occur. In the School Survey on Crime and Safety, school
principals were asked how often certain disciplinary problems occur.
Behaviors discussed in this indicator include racial tensions, bullying,
student verbal abuse of teachers, widespread classroom disorder, and
student acts of disrespect for teachers that happened daily or once a
week. If gang or cult activities happened at all in the school, they were
included as problematic. 

In 1999-2000, more than one-quarter (29 percent) of public schools
reported daily or weekly student bullying (table 16.1). Among the other
discipline problems reported, 19 percent of public schools reported
student acts of disrespect for teachers, 13 percent reported student
verbal abuse of teachers, and 3 percent reported student racial tensions
and widespread disorder in classrooms. Furthermore, 19 percent of
public schools reported undesirable gang activities and 7 percent of
schools reported undesirable cult or extremist activities occurred at
some point in time during the 1999-2000 school year. 

Discipline problems reported by public schools varied by school
characteristics. For example, middle schools were more likely than
elementary and secondary schools to report racial tensions, bullying,
verbal abuse of teachers, and widespread disorder in classrooms (figure
16.1 and table 16.1). Middle schools were more likely than elementary
schools, but less likely than high schools to report gang or extremist
cult activity. 

The prevalence of discipline problems was positively related to school
size. As school enrollment increased, so did the likelihood of schools
reporting each discipline problem at their school except widespread
disorder in the classroom-which was reported by relatively few
principals (less than 5 percent at all enrollment levels). Twenty-six
percent of principals at schools with 1,000 or more students reported
student verbal abuse of teachers, compared to 14 percent of schools
with 500-999 students, 10 percent of schools with 300-499 students,
and 7 percent of schools with less than 300 students. 

Schools that had one or more violent incidents occur at their school
were more likely to report each of the disciplinary problems discussed
above, than those schools with no violent incidents. For example, 34
percent of schools with one or more violent incidents reported that
bullying happened at least once a week, compared with 17 percent of
schools with no violent incidents. 

This is a new indicator. 


INDICATOR 17
STUDENTS' USE OF ALCOHOL 

In 2001, 47 percent of students in grades 9-12 had at least one drink of
alcohol anywhere in the 30 days before being surveyed and 5 percent
had at least one drink on school property. 

The consumption of alcohol by students on school property, a crime in
itself, may lead to other crimes and misbehavior on the part of students.
It may also lead to a school environment that is harmful to students,
teachers, and staff (Fagan and Wilkinson 1998). In the Youth Risk
Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked whether they had
consumed alcohol at all in the past 30 days (referred to as "anywhere"
in this analysis) and if they had consumed alcohol on school property.
In 2001, 47 percent of students had consumed at least one drink of
alcohol anywhere in the 30 days before being surveyed, and a smaller
percentage (5 percent) had consumed at least one drink on school
property (table 17.1). When examining students' reports of drinking
between 1993 and 2001, no consistent patterns of increase or decrease
were found in the percentage of students who had consumed alcohol,
both anywhere and on school property. 

In every survey year except 1995, males were more likely than females
to have used alcohol anywhere (figure 17.1 and table 17.1).
Furthermore, in every survey year, males were more likely than females
to use alcohol on school property. For example, in 2001, 6 percent of
males had reported using alcohol on school property, compared with 4
percent of females. 

Grade level was positively associated with the likelihood that students
reported drinking alcohol anywhere in every survey year: students in
higher grades were more likely to report drinking alcohol anywhere
than students in lower grades (figure 17.2 and table 17.1). However, no
such relationship was found across grade levels for students' reports of
drinking alcohol on school property. 

In 2001, Asian and Black students were less likely to use alcohol
anywhere than American Indian, Pacific Islander, White, and Hispanic
students. Roughly one-third of Asian (28 percent) and Black (33
percent) students reported using alcohol anywhere, compared with
about one-half (between 45 and 52 percent) of students in other racial/
ethnic groups. While there also appear to be differences by
race/ethnicity in students' use of alcohol on school property, few
differences could be detected due to large standard errors associated
with these estimates. 

This indicator repeats information from the 2002 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report. 


INDICATOR 18
STUDENTS' USE OF MARIJUANA 

In 2001, 24 percent of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana
anywhere during the last 30 days and 5 percent of students reported
using marijuana on school property. 

The use of drugs, such as marijuana, at school may lead to a school
environment that is harmful to students, teachers, and school
administrators. In the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades
9-12 were asked whether they had used marijuana at all in the past 30
days (referred to as "anywhere" in this analysis) and whether they had
used marijuana on school property. In 2001, about one-quarter (24
percent) of students in grades 9-12 reported using marijuana anywhere
during the last 30 days, whereas 5 percent of students reported using
marijuana on school property (table 18.1). Overall, no consistent
patterns of increase or decrease were found in the percentage of
students who had used marijuana between 1993 and 2001, both
anywhere and on school property. 

Both students' sex and grade level were associated with students' use of
marijuana at school. Males were more likely than females to have used
marijuana in every survey year, both anywhere and on school property
(figure 18.1 and table 18.1). For example, in 2001, 8 percent of males
and 3 percent of females reported using marijuana on school property.
In that same year, students in lower grades were less likely than
students in higher grades to report using marijuana anywhere (figure
18.2 and table 18.1). However, no corresponding difference could be
detected in students' use of marijuana on school property according to
grade in school-between 5 and 6 percent of students in grades 9- 12
reported such use. 

In 2001, Asian students were less likely than students of all other
race/ethnicities to report using marijuana anywhere. However, few
differences could be found among these groups for students' marijuana
use at school. One such difference was that American Indian/ Alaska
Native students were more likely than students of all other
race/ethnicities to report marijuana use at school in 2001. However,
there was no difference detected in American Indian/Alaska Native
students' use of marijuana at school between 1999 and 2001. While
students from various racial/ethnic groups appear to differ in their use
of marijuana, these estimates are associated with large standard errors
and should be interpreted with caution. 

This indicator repeats information from the 2002 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report. 


INDICATOR 19
STUDENTS' REPORTS OF DRUG AVAILABILITY ON SCHOOL
PROPERTY 

In 2001, 29 percent of all students in grades 9-12 reported that someone
had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on school property in
the 12 months before the survey. 

The availability of drugs on school property has a disruptive and
corrupting influence on the school environment (Nolin et al. 1997). In
the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students in grades 9-12 were asked
whether someone had offered, sold, or given them an illegal drug on
school property in the 12 months before the survey. In 2001, 29 percent
of all students in grades 9-12 reported that drugs were made available to
them on school property (table 19.1). No consistent patterns of increase
or decrease were found in the percentage of students who had reported
that drugs were made available to them from 1993 to 2001, with
between 24 and 32 percent of students reporting that this occurred in
each survey year. 

Males were more likely than females to report that drugs were offered,
sold, or given to them on school property in each survey year (figure
19.1 and table 19.1). For example, in 2001, 35 percent of males
reported the availability of drugs, while 23 percent of females did so. 
In 1999 and 2001, students' racial/ethnic backgrounds were examined in
relation to whether they reported having illegal drugs offered, sold, or
given to them on school property (figure 19.2 and table 19.1). In 2001,
Black and Asian students were less likely than Hispanic,
Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders and students of multiple race/ethnicities to
report that drugs were made available to them. While there appear to be
other differences among students in various racial/ethnic groups, these
estimates are associated with large standard errors and should be
interpreted with caution. 

This indicator repeats information from the 2002 Indicators of School
Crime and Safety report. 



APPENDIX A
TECHNICAL NOTES

GENERAL INFORMATION           

The information presented in this report was obtained from many data
sources, including databases from the National Center for Education
Statistics (NCES), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). While some of the
data were collected from universe surveys, most were gathered by
sample surveys. Some questions from different surveys may appear the
same, but they were actually asked of different populations of students
(e.g., students ages 12-18 or students in grades 9-12); in different years;
about experiences that occurred within different periods of time (e.g., in
the past 30 days or during the past 12 months); and at different
locations (e.g., in school or at home). Readers of this report should take
particular care when comparing data from the different data sources.
Because of the variation in collection procedures, timing, phrasing of
questions, and so forth, the results from the different sources may not
be strictly comparable. After introducing the data sources used for this
report, the next section discusses the accuracy of estimates and
describes the statistical procedures used. 

SOURCES OF DATA 

Table A-1 presents some key information for each of the data sets used
in the report, including the survey year(s), target population, response
rate, and sample size. The remainder of the section briefly describes
each data set and provides directions for obtaining more information.
The exact wording of the interview questions used to construct the
indicators are presented in table A-2. 

Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) 

This report draws upon data on teacher victimization from the Schools
and Staffing Survey (SASS), which provides national- and state-level
data on public and national-and affiliation-level on private schools. The
1993-94 and 1999-2000 SASS consists of four sets of linked surveys,
including surveys of schools, the principals of each selected school, a
subsample of teachers within each school, and public school districts.
Data were collected by multistage sampling, which began with the
selection of schools. This report uses 1993-1994 and 1999-2000 SASS
data. Approximately 9,900 public schools and 3,300 private schools
were selected to participate in the 1993-1994 SASS and 9,900 public
schools and 3,600 private schools were selected to participate in the
1999-2000 SASS. Within each school, teachers were further stratified
into one of five teacher types in the following hierarchy: (1) Asian or
Pacific Islander; (2) American Indian, Aleut, or Eskimo; (3) teachers
who teach classes designed for students with Limited English
Proficiency; (4) teachers in their first, second, or third year of teaching;
and (5) teachers not classified in any of the other groups. Within each
teacher stratum, teachers were selected systematically with equal
probability. In 1993-1994, approximately 53,000 public school teachers
and 10,400 private school teachers were sampled. In 1999-2000, 56,400
public school teachers and 10,800 private school teachers were
sampled. 

This report focuses on responses from teachers. The overall weighted
response rates were 83 percent and 77 percent for public school
teachers in 1993-1994 and 1999- 2000, respectively. For private school
teachers, the overall weighted response rates were 73 percent and 67
percent in 1993-1994 and 1999-2000, respectively. Values were
imputed for questionnaire items that should have been answered but
were not. For additional information about SASS contact:

National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) 
The National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is
one component of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System
(YRBSS), an epidemiological surveillance system developed by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to monitor the
prevalence of youth behaviors that most influence health. The YRBS
focuses on priority health-risk behaviors established during youth that
result in the most significant mortality, morbidity, disability, and social
problems during both youth and adulthood. This report uses 1993,
1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001 YRBS data. 

The YRBS used a three-stage cluster sampling design to produce a
nationally representative sample of students in grades 9-12 in the
United States. The target population consisted of all public and private
school students in grades 9-12 in the 50 states and the District of
Columbia. The first-stage sampling frame included selecting primary
sampling units (PSUs) from strata formed on the basis of urbanization
and the relative percentage of Black and Hispanic students in the PSU.
These PSUs are either large counties or groups of smaller, adjacent
counties. At the second stage, schools were selected with probability
proportional to school enrollment size. Schools with substantial
numbers of black and Hispanic students were sampled at relatively
higher rates than all other schools. The final stage of sampling consisted
of randomly selecting within each chosen school at each grade 9- 12
one or two intact classes of a required subject, such as English or social
studies. All students in selected classes were eligible to participate.
Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 16,300, 15,300, and 13,600 students
were selected to participate in the 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001
surveys, respectively. 

The overall response rate was 70 percent for the 1993 survey, 60
percent for the 1995 survey, 69 percent for the 1997 survey, 66 percent
for the 1999 survey, and 63 percent for the 2001 survey. NCES
standards call for response rates of 85 percent or better for
cross-sectional surveys and bias analyses are called for by NCES when
that percentage is not achieved. For YRBS data, a full nonresponse bias
analysis has not been done because the data necessary to do the analysis
are not available. The weights were developed to adjust for nonresponse
and the oversampling of black and Hispanic students in the sample. The
final weights were constructed so that only weighted proportions of
students (not weighted counts of students) in each grade matched
national population projections. 

In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office of Management and
Budget's standards for the classification of federal data on race and
ethnicity, the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The version
of the race and ethnicity question used in 1993, 1995, and 1997 was: 
How do you describe yourself? 
1. White - not Hispanic 
2. Black - not Hispanic 
3. Hispanic or Latino
4. Asian or Pacific Islander 
5. American Indian or Alaskan Native 
6. Other


The version used in 1999 and 2001 was:
How do you describe yourself? (Select one or more responses.)

A. American Indian or Alaska Native 
B. Asian
C. Black or African American 
D. Hispanic or Latino
E. Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 
F. White

This new version of the question used in 1999 and 2001 results in the
possibility of respondents marking more than one category. While more
accurately reflecting respondents' racial and ethnic identity, the new
item cannot be directly compared to responses to the old item. A recent
study by Brener, Kann, and McManus (2003) found that allowing
students to select more than one response to the race/ethnicity question
on the YRBS had only a minimal effect on reported race/ethnicity
among high school students.

School Survey on Crime and Safety: 2000 
The School Survey on Crime and Safety (SSOCS) was conducted by
NCES in Spring/ Summer of the 1999-2000 school year. SSOCS
focuses on incidents of specific crimes/offenses and a variety of specific
discipline issues in public schools. It also covers characteristics of
school policies, school violence prevention programs and policies and
school characteristics that have been associated with school crime. The
survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of regular
public elementary, middle, and high schools in the 50 states and the
District of Columbia. Special education, alternative and vocational
schools, schools in the territories, and schools that taught only
prekindergarten, kindergarten, or adult education were not included in
the sample. 

The sampling frame for the SSOCS:2000 was constructed from the
public school universe file created for the 2000 Schools and Staffing
Survey from the 1997-98 NCES Common Core of Data (CCD) Public
School Universe File. The sample was stratified by instructional level,
type of locale, and enrollment size. Within the primary strata, schools
were also sorted by geographic region and by percent minority
enrollment. The sample sizes were then allocated to the primary strata
in rough proportion to the aggregate square root of the size of
enrollment of schools in the stratum. A total of 3,300 schools were
selected for the study. Among those, 2,270 schools completed the
survey. In March of 2000, questionnaires were mailed to school
principals, who were asked to complete the survey or to have it
completed by the person most knowledgeable about discipline issues at
the school. The weighted overall response rate was 70 percent, and item
nonresponse rates ranged from 0-2.7 percent on the public-use data file.
For SSOCS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis was conducted and no
bias on the basis of nonresponse was detected. The weights were
developed to adjust for the variable probabilities of selection and
differential nonresponse and can be used to produce national estimates
for regular public schools in the 1999-2000 school year. For more

National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) 
The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), administered for
the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics by the Census Bureau, is the
nation's primary source of information on crime victimization and the
victims of crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned in 1992, the NCVS
collects detailed information on the frequency and nature of the crimes
of rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, theft,
household burglary, and motor vehicle theft experienced by Americans
and their households each year. The survey measures crimes reported as
well as those not reported to police. 

The NCVS sample consists of about 53,841 households selected using a
stratified, multistage cluster design. In the first stage, the primary
sampling units (PSUs), consisting of counties or groups of counties,
were selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, called Enumeration
Districts (EDs), were selected from each sampled PSU. Finally, from
selected EDs, clusters of four households, called segments, were
selected for interview. At each stage, the selection was done
proportionate to population size in order to create a self-weighting
sample. The final sample was augmented to account for housing units
constructed after the decennial Census. Within each sampled
household, Census Bureau personnel interviewed all household
members ages 12 and older to determine whether they had been
victimized by the measured crimes during the 6 months preceding the
interview. About 76,760 persons ages 12 and older are interviewed each
6 months. Households remain in the sample for 3 years and are
interviewed 7 times at 6-month intervals. The initial interview at each
sample unit is used only to bound future interviews to establish a time
frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered in these subsequent
interviews. After their seventh interview, households are replaced by
new sample households. The NCVS has consistently obtained a
response rate of about 92 percent at the household level. During the
study period, the completion rates for persons within households were
about 87 percent. Thus, final response rates were about 80 percent.
Weights were developed to permit estimates for the total U.S.
population 12 years and older. For more information about the NCVS,

School Crime Supplement (SCS) 

Created as a supplement to the NCVS and co-designed by the National
Center for Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice Statistics, the
School Crime Supplement (SCS) survey was conducted in 1989, 1995,
1999, and 2001 to collect additional information about school-related
victimizations on a national level. This report includes data from the
1995, 1999, and 2001 collections. The 1989 data are not included in
this report as a result of methodological changes to the NCVS and SCS.
The survey was designed to assist policymakers as well as academic
researchers and practitioners at the federal, state, and local levels so that
they can make informed decisions concerning crime in schools. The
SCS asks students a number of key questions about their experiences
with and perceptions of crime and violence that occurred inside their
school, on school grounds, on a school bus, or on the way to or from
school. Additional questions not included in the NCVS were also added
to the SCS, such as those concerning preventive measures used by the
school, students' participation in afterschool activities, students'
perceptions of school rules, the presence of weapons and street gangs in
school, the presence of hate-related words and graffiti in school, student
reports of bullying and reports of rejection at school, and the
availability of drugs and alcohol in school, as well as attitudinal
questions relating to fear of victimization and avoidance behavior at
school. 

In all SCS survey years, the SCS was conducted for a 6-month period
from January- June in all households selected for the NCVS (see
discussion above for information about the sampling design). It should
be noted that the initial NCVS interview is included in the SCS data
analysis. Within these households, the eligible respondents for the SCS
were those household members who had attended school at any time
during the 6 months preceding the interview, and were enrolled in
grades 6-12 in a school that would help them advance toward
eventually receiving a high school diploma. The age range of students
covered in this report is 12-18 years of age. Eligible respondents were
asked the supplemental questions in the SCS only after completing their
entire NCVS interview. 

In 2001, the SCS survey instrument was modified from previous
collections in three ways. First, in 1995 and 1999, "at school" was
defined for respondents as in the school building, on the school
grounds, or on a school bus. In 2001, the definition for 
"at school" was changed to mean in the school building, on school
property, on a school bus, or going to and from school. This change was
made to the 2001 questionnaire in order to be consistent with the
definition of "at school" as it is constructed in the National Crime
Victimization Survey. Cognitive interviews conducted by the Census
Bureau on the 1999 School Crime Supplement suggested that
modifications to the definition of "at school" would not have a
substantial impact on the estimates.

The prevalence of victimization for 1995, 1999, and 2001 was
calculated by using NCVS incident variables appended to the 1995,
1999, and 2001 SCS data files. The NCVS type of crime variable was
used to classify victimizations of students in the SCS as serious violent,
violent, or theft. The NCVS variables asking where the incident
happened and what the victim was doing when it happened were used
to ascertain whether the incident happened at school. For prevalence of
victimization, the NCVS definition of "at school" includes in the school
building, on school property, or on the way to or from school.

Second, the SCS questions pertaining to fear and avoidance have
changed between the 1999 and the 2001 SCS. In 1995 and 1999,
students were asked if they avoided places or were fearful because they
thought someone would "attack or harm" them. In 2001, students were
asked if they avoided places or were fearful because they thought
someone would "attack or threaten to attack them." These changes
should be considered when making comparisons between the 1995 and
1999 data and the 2001 data. Readers should also note that separate
estimates were provided in the Indicators of School Crime and Safety
2001 report for the prevalence of fear at school and on the way to and
from school. This year's report provides one estimate that combines at
school with on the way to and from school and compares it to those
students who report fear away from school.

Third, the SCS question pertaining to gangs has changed in the 2001
SCS. The introduction and definition of gangs as well as the placement
of the item in the questionnaire changed in the 2001 SCS. Because of
these changes, the reader should be cautioned not to compare results
presented in this report with those estimates of gangs presented in
previous reports.

Total victimization is a combination of violent  victimization and theft.
If the student reported an incident of either violent or theft victimization
or both, he or she is counted as having experienced "total"
victimization. Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual assault,
robbery, and aggravated assault. Violent crimes include serious
violent crimes and simple assault.

A total of 9,728 students participated in the 1995 SCS, 8,398 in 1999,
and 8,374 in 2001. In the 2001 SCS, the household completion rate was
93 percent. In the 1995 and 1999 SCS, the household completion rates
were 95 percent and 94 percent, respectively; and the student
completion rates were both 78 percent. For the 2001 SCS, the student
completion rate was 77 percent. Thus, the overall SCS response rate 
(calculated by multiplying the household completion rate by the student
completion rate) was 74 percent in 1995, 73 percent in 1999 and 72
percent in 2001. Response rates for most survey items were
high-typically over 95 percent of all eligible respondents. The weights
were developed to compensate for differential probabilities of selection
and nonresponse. The weighted data permit inferences about the
eligible student population who were enrolled in schools in 1995, 1999,
and 2001. For SCS data, a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been
conducted. For more information about SCS, contact:

School Associated Violent Death Surveillance System (SAVD) 
The School Associated Violent Death Surveillance System (SAVD) is
an epidemiological study developed by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Education
and the U.S. Department of Justice. SAVD seeks to describe the
epidemiology of school-associated violent deaths, identify common
features of these deaths, estimate the rate of school-associated violent
death in the United States, and identify potential risk factors for these
deaths. The surveillance system includes descriptive data on all
school-associated violent deaths in the United States, including all
homicides, suicides, and unintentional firearm-related deaths where the
fatal injury occurred on the campus of a functioning elementary or
secondary school, while the victim was on the way to or from regular
sessions at such a school, or while attending or on the way to or from an
official school-sponsored event. Victims of such events include
nonstudents as well as students and staff members. SAVD includes
descriptive information about the school, event, victim(s), and
offender(s). The SAVD Surveillance System has collected data from
July 1, 1992 through June 30, 2002. 

SAVD uses a four-step process to identify and collect data on
school-associated violent deaths. Cases were initially identified through
a search of the Lexis/Nexis and Dialog newspaper and media databases.
Then police officials are contacted to confirm the details of the case to
determine if the event meets the case definition. Once a case is
confirmed, a police official and a school official are interviewed
regarding details about the school, event, victim(s), and offender(s). If
police officials are unwilling or unable to complete the interview, a
copy of the full police report is obtained. The information obtained on
schools includes school demographics, attendance/absentee rates,
suspension/expulsions and mobility, school history of weapon carrying,
security measures, violence prevention activities, school response to the
event, and school policies about weapon carrying. Event information
includes the location of injury, the  context of injury (while classes
held, during break, etc.), motives for injury, method of injury, and
school and community events happening around the time period.
Information obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) includes
demographics, circumstances of the event (date/time, alcohol or drug
use, number of persons involved), types and origins of weapons,
criminal history, psychological risk factors, school-related problems,
extracurricular activities, and family history, including structure and
stressors.

One hundred and five school-associated violent deaths were identified
from July 1, 1992-June 30, 1994 (See Kachur et al. June 12, 1996.
JAMA. 275:22: 1729-1733).

The most recent data collection effort identified 253 school-associated
violent deaths between July 1, 1994-June 30, 1999 (See Anderson et al.
December 5, 2001. JAMA. 286:21: 2695-2702). The first effort
achieved a response rate of 85 percent for police officials and 81
percent for school officials. The most recent SAVD has achieved a
response rate of 97 percent for police officials and 78 percent for school
officials.

Data for subsequent study years are still preliminary and subject to
change. For additional information about SAVD, contact:

Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) 

The Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), which are a part of the
Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, provide incident-level
information on criminal homicides including situation (number of
victims to number of offenders); the age, sex, and race of victims and
offenders; types of weapons used; circumstances of the incident; and
the relationship of the victim to the offender. The data are provided
monthly to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) by local law
enforcement agencies participating in the FBI's UCR program. The data
include murders and non-negligent manslaughters in the United States
from January 1976-December 2001. That is, negligent manslaughters
and justifiable homicides have been eliminated from the data. Based
on law enforcement agency reports, the FBI estimates that 528,648
murders were committed from 1976 to 2001. Agencies provided
detailed information on 480,455 victims and 532,177 offenders.

National coverage is quite high (about 91 percent of homicides are
included in the SHR). However, missing reports can be corrected using
weights to match national and state estimates. Estimates from the SHR
used in this Indicators report were generated by the Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) using a weight developed by BJS that reconciles the
counts of SHR homicide victims with those in the UCR for the 1992
through 2001 data years. The weight is the same for all cases for a
given year. The weight represents the ratio of the number of homicides
reported in the UCR to the number reported in the SHR. For additional

Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System Fatal
(WISQARS(tm) Fatal) 

WISQARS Fatal provides mortality data related to injury. The mortality
data reported in WISQARS Fatal come from death certificate data
reported to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. Data include causes of death
reported by attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners. It
also includes demographic information about decedents reported by
funeral directors who obtain that information from family members and
other informants. NCHS collects, compiles, verifies and prepares these
data for release to the public. The data provide information about what
types of injuries are leading causes of deaths, how common they are,
and who they affect. These data are intended for a broad audience-the
public, the media, public health practitioners and researchers, and
public health officials-to increase their knowledge of injury. 
WISQARS Fatal mortality reports provide tables of the total numbers
of injury-related deaths and the death rates per 100,000 U.S. population.
The reports list deaths according to cause (mechanism) and intent
(manner) of injury by state, race, Hispanic origin, sex, and age
groupings. For more information on WISQARS Fatal, contact:

ACCURACY OF ESTIMATES 
The accuracy of any statistic is determined by the joint effects of
"nonsampling" and
"sampling" errors. Both types of error affect the estimates presented in
this report. Several sources can contribute to nonsampling errors. For
example, members of the population of interest are inadvertently
excluded from the sampling frame; sampled members refuse to answer
some of the survey questions (item nonresponse) or all of the survey
questions (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made during data
editing, coding, or entry; the responses that respondents provide differ
from the "true" responses; or measurement instruments such as tests or
questionnaires fail to measure the characteristics they are intended to
measure. Although nonsampling errors due to questionnaire and item
nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by the adjustment of sample
weights and imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling errors or
gauging the effects of these errors is usually difficult.

Sampling errors occur because observations are made on samples rather
than on entire populations. Surveys of population universes are not
subject to sampling errors.  Estimates based on a sample will differ
somewhat from those that would have been     obtained by a complete
census of the relevant population using the same survey instruments,
instructions, and procedures. The standard error of a statistic is a
measure of the variation due to sampling; it indicates the precision of
the statistic obtained in a particular sample. In addition, the standard
errors for two sample statistics can be used to estimate the precision of
the difference between the two statistics and to help determine whether
the difference based on the sample is large enough so that it represents
the population difference.

Most of the data used in this report were obtained from complex
sampling designs rather than a simple random design. These features of
complex sampling require different techniques to calculate standard
errors than are used for data collected with a simple random sample.
Therefore, calculation of standard errors requires procedures that are
markedly different from the ones used when the data are from a simple
random sample. The Taylor series approximation technique or the
balanced repeated replication (BRR) method was used to estimate most
of the statistics and their standard errors in this report. Table A-3 lists
the various methods used to compute standard errors for different data
sets.

Standard error calculation for data from the National Crime
Victimization Survey and the School Crime Supplement were based on
the Taylor series approximation method using PSU and strata variables
available from the data set was employed. For statistics based on all
years of NCVS data standard errors were derived from a formula
developed by the Census Bureau, which consists of three generalized
variance function (gvf) constant parameters that represent the curve
fitted to the individual standard errors calculated using the Jackknife
Repeated Replication technique. The formulas used to compute the
adjusted standard errors associated with percentages or population
counts can be found in table A-3.
                    
Statistical Procedures 

The comparisons in the text have been tested for statistical significance
to ensure that the differences are larger than might be expected due to
sampling variations. Unless otherwise noted, all statements cited in the
report are statistically significant at the .05 level. Several test
procedures were used, depending upon the type of data being analyzed
and the nature of the statement being tested. The primary test procedure
used in this report was the Student's t statistic, which tests the
difference between two sample estimates, for example, between males
and females
Once the t value was computed, it was compared with the published
tables of values at certain critical levels, called alpha levels. For this
report, an alpha value of 0.05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. If
the t value was larger than 1.96, then the difference between the two
estimates was statistically significant at the 95 percent level. 

A linear trend test was used when a statement describing a linear trend,
rather than the differences between two discrete categories, was made.
This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the percentage of
students using drugs increased (or decreased) over time or whether the
percentage of students who reported being physically attacked in school
increased (or decreased) with their age. Based on a regression with, for
example, student's age as the independent variable and whether a
student was physically attacked as the dependent variable, the test
involves computing the regression coefficient (b) and its corresponding
standard error (se). The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test statistic t. If t
is greater than 1.96, the critical value for one comparison at the .05
alpha level, the hypothesis that there is a linear relationship between
student's age and being physically attacked is not rejected. 
When using data sets in which multiple years of data are available, a
Bonferroni adjustment to the significance level was used when one
year's estimate was compared to another. The Bonferroni adjustment to
the significance level was used to ensure that the significance level for
the tests as a series was at the .05 level. Generally, when multiple
statistical comparisons are made, it becomes increasingly likely that an
indication of a population difference is erroneous. Even when there is
no difference in the population, at an alpha of .05, there is still a 5
percent chance of concluding that an observed t value representing one
comparison in the sample is large enough to be statistically significant.
As the number of years, and thus the number of comparisons increase,
the risk of making such an erroneous inference also increases. The
Bonferroni procedure corrects the significance (or alpha) level for the
total number of comparisons made within a particular classification
variable. For each classification variable, there are (K*(K-1)/2) possible
comparisons (or nonredundant pairwise combinations), where K is the
number of categories. The Bonferroni procedure divides the alpha level
for a single t test by the number of possible pairwise comparisons in
order to produce a new alpha level that is corrected for the fact that
multiple contrasts are being made. As a result, the t value for a certain
alpha level (e.g., .05) increases, which makes it more difficult to claim
that the difference observed is statistically significant.  

While many descriptive comparisons in this report were tested using t
statistic or the F-statistic, some comparisons among categories of an
ordered variable with three or more levels involved a test for a linear
trend across all categories, rather than a series of tests between pairs of
categories. In this report, when differences among percentages were
examined relative to a variable with ordered categories, Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) was used to test for a linear relationship between
the two variables. To do this, ANOVA models included orthogonal
linear contrasts corresponding to successive levels of the independent
variable. The squares of the Taylorized standard errors (that is, standard
errors that were calculated by the Taylor series method), the variance
between the means, and the unweighted sample sizes were used to
partition total sum of squares into within- and between-group sums of
squares. These were used to create mean squares for the within- and
between-group variance components and their corresponding F
statistics, which were then compared with published values of F for a
significance level of .05. Significant values of both the overall F and the
F associated with the linear contrast term were required as evidence of a
linear relationship between the two variables. 


APPENDIX B
GLOSSARY OF TERMS 

GENERAL TERMS 

Cluster sampling Cluster sampling is a technique in which the sampling
of respondents or subjects occurs within clusters or groups. For
example, selecting students by sampling schools and the students that
attend that school. 

Crime Any violation of a statute or regulation or any act that the
government has determined is injurious to the public, including felonies
and misdemeanors. Such violation may or may not involve violence,
and it may affect individuals or property. 

Incident A specific criminal act or offense involving one or more
victims and one or more offenders. 

Multi-stage sampling A survey sampling technique in which there is
more than one wave of sampling. That is, one sample of units is drawn,
and then another sample is drawn within that sample. For example, at
the first stage, a number of Census blocks may be sampled out of all the
Census blocks in the United States. At the second stage, households are
sampled within the previously sampled Census blocks. 

Prevalence The percentage of the population directly affected by crime
in a given period. This rate is based upon specific information elicited
directly from the respondent regarding crimes committed against his or
her person, against his or her property, or against an individual bearing
a unique relationship to him or her. It is not based upon perceptions and
beliefs about, or reactions to, criminal acts. 
School An education institution consisting of one or more of grades K
through 12. 

School crime Any criminal activity that is committed on school
property. 

School year The 12-month period of time denoting the beginning and
ending dates for school accounting purposes, usually from July 1
through June 30. 

Stratification is a survey sampling technique in which the target
population is divided into mutually exclusive groups or strata based on
some variable or variables (e.g., metropolitan area) and sampling of
units occurs separately within each stratum. 

Unequal probabilities A survey sampling technique in which sampled
units do not have the same probability of selection into the sample. For
example, the investigator may over-sample minority students in order to
increase the sample sizes of minority students. Minority students would
then be more likely than other students to be sampled. 

SPECIFIC TERMS USED IN VARIOUS SURVEYS 

National Crime Victimization Survey 
At school (students) Inside the school building, on school property
(school parking area, play area, school bus, etc.), or on the way to or
from school. 

At school (teachers) Inside the school building, on school property
(school parking area, play area, school bus, etc.), at worksite, or while
working. For thefts, "while working" was not considered, since thefts of
teachers' property kept at school can occur when teachers are not
present.            

Aggravated assault Attack or attempted attack with a weapon,
regardless of whether or not an injury occurs, and attack without a
weapon when serious injury results. 

Rape Forced sexual intercourse including both psychological coercion,
as well as physical force. Forced sexual intercourse means vaginal,
anal, or oral penetration by the offender(s). Includes attempts and verbal
threats of rape. This category also includes incidents where the
penetration is from a foreign object such as a bottle. 

Robbery Completed or attempted theft, directly from a person, of
property or cash by force or threat of force, with or without a weapon,
and with or without injury.             

Rural A place not located inside the Metropolitan Statistical Area
(MSA). This category includes a variety of localities, ranging from
sparsely populated rural areas to cities with populations of less than
50,000. 

Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated
assault. 

Sexual assault A wide range of victimizations, separate from rape or
attempted rape. These crimes include attacks or attempted attacks
generally involving unwanted sexual contact between the victim and
offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve force and includes
such things as grabbing or fondling. Sexual assault also includes verbal
threats. 

Simple assault Attack without a weapon resulting either in no injury,
minor injury, or in undetermined injury requiring less than 2 days of
hospitalization. Also includes attempted assault without a weapon. 
Suburban A county or counties containing a central city, plus any
contiguous counties that are linked socially and economically to the
central city. On the data tables, suburban areas are categorized as those
portions of metropolitan areas situated "outside central cities." 
Theft Completed or attempted theft of property or cash without
personal contact. 

Victimization A crime as it affects one individual person or household.
For personal crimes, the number of victimizations is equal to the
number of victims involved. The number of victimizations may be
greater than the number of incidents because more than one person may
be victimized during an incident.       

Victimization rate A measure of the occurrence of victimizations
among a specific population group. 

Violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or
simple assault. 

Urban The largest city (or grouping of cities) in an MSA. 

School Crime Supplement 

Total victimization Combination of violent victimization and theft. If a
student reported an incident of either type, he or she is counted as
having experienced any victimization. If the student reported having
experienced both, he or she is counted once under "total victimization." 
At school In the school building, on school property, on a school bus, or
going to or from school. 

Serious violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated
assault. 

Violent crime Rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, or
simple assault. 

Youth Risk Behavior Survey

inhalants, steroids, or prescription drugs without a doctor's permission,
heroin, and methamphetamines. 


School Survey on Crime and Safety 

At school/at your school Includes activities that happened in school
buildings, on school grounds, on school buses, and at places that held
school-sponsored events or activities. Unless otherwise specified,
respondents were requested to report on activities that occurred during
normal school hours or when school activities/events were in session. 
Cult or extremist group A group that espouses radical beliefs and
practices, which may include a religious component, that are widely
seen as threatening the basic values and cultural norms of society at
large. 

Firearm/explosive device Any weapon that is designed to (or may
readily be converted to) expel a projectile by the action of an explosive.
This includes guns, bombs, grenades, mines, rockets, missiles, pipe
bombs, or similar devices designed to explode and capable of causing
bodily harm or property damage.

persons, whether formal or informal, that has a common name, signs,
symbols or colors, whose members engage, either individually or
collectively, in violent or other forms of illegal behavior. 
Insubordination A deliberate and inexcusable defiance of or refusal to
obey a school rule, authority, or a reasonable order. It includes but is
not limited to direct defiance of school authority, failure to attend
assigned detention or on-campus supervision, failure to respond to a
call slip, and physical or verbal intimidation/abuse. 

Intimidation To frighten, compel, or deter by actual or implied threats.
It includes bullying and sexual harassment. 

Physical attack or fight An actual and intentional touching or striking of
another person against his or her will, or the intentional causing of

Rape Forced sexual intercourse (vaginal, anal, or oral penetration).
Includes penetration from a foreign object. 

Robbery The taking or attempting to take anything of value that is
owned by another person or organization, under confrontational
circumstances by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting
the victim in fear. A key difference between robbery and theft/larceny is
that a threat or battery is involved in robbery. 

Serious violent incidents Include rape, sexual battery other than rape,
physical attacks or fights with a weapon, threats of physical attack with
a weapon, and robbery with or without a weapon. 

Sexual battery An incident that includes threatened rape, fondling,
indecent liberties, child molestation, or sodomy. Principals were
instructed that classification of these incidents should take into
consideration the age and developmentally appropriate behavior of the
offenders. 

Sexual harassment Unsolicited, offensive behavior that inappropriately
asserts sexuality over another person. The behavior may be verbal or
non-verbal. 

Specialized school A school that is specifically for students who were
referred for disciplinary reasons. The school may also have students
who were referred for other reasons. The school may be at the same
location as the respondent's school. 

Theft/larceny (taking things over $10 without personal confrontation)
The unlawful taking of another person's property without personal
confrontation, threat, violence, or bodily harm. Included are pocket
picking, stealing purse or backpack (if left unattended or no force was
used to take it from owner), theft from a building, theft from a motor
vehicle or motor vehicle parts or accessories, theft of  bicycles, theft
from vending machines, and all other types of thefts. 

Vandalism The willful damage or destruction of school property
including bombing, arson, graffiti, and other acts that cause property
damage. Includes damage caused by computer hacking.

Statistical Area [MSA] with population greater than or equal to
400,000, or a population density greater than or equal to 6,000 per
square mile) or a mid-size central city (a central city of an MSA, but not
designated as a large central city).

Elementary school teachers An elementary school teacher is one who,
when asked for the grades taught, checked: (1) only "ungraded" and
