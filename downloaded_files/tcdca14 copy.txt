Tribal Crime Data Collection Activities, 2014

Steven W. Perry, BJS Statistician

*************
Background
*************

The Tribal Law and Order Act (TLOA), enacted on July 29, 2010, requires the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) to (1) establish and implement a tribal 
data collection system and (2) support tribal participation in national 
records and information systems (P.L. 111-211, 124 Stat. 2258, § 251(b)). The 
act further requires the director of BJS to consult with Indian tribes to 
establish and implement this data collection system. The BJS director is 
required to report to Congress annually the data collected and analyzed in 
accordance with the act. This report describes activities in support of BJS’s 
tribal crime data collection system and summarizes findings and program 
enhancements for FY 2014.

A total of 566 tribal entities in the contiguous 48 states and in Alaska were 
eligible for funding and services from the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) in 
2014. ***Footnote 1 See Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive 
Services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs at 
http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-01-29/pdf/2014-01683.pdf.*** In 2010, 
there were 334 federally and state-recognized American Indian reservations. 
An estimated 4.8 million people lived on American Indian reservations or in 
Alaska Native villages in the United States in 2010.*** Footnote 2 For more 
information about federally recognized tribes, reservations, and Alaska 
Native village statistical areas, see 
http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/tcdca12.pdf.*** About a quarter (1.1 
million) of these individuals classified themselves as American Indian or 
Alaska Native (AIAN).

*************
Highlights
*************

* BJS awarded funding to conduct a survey of state and local justice agencies 
that service tribal lands to better understand this aspect of the tribal 
justice system.

* BJS identified 426 tribal courts across the United States for the National 
Survey of Tribal Court Systems.

* At midyear 2012, a total of 2,364 inmates were confined in 79 Indian 
country jails—a 5.6% increase from the 2,239 inmates confined at midyear 
2011.

* During 2011, 2,658 American Indian or Alaska Natives were arrested and 
booked by federal law enforcement agencies, 1,254 were sentenced in U.S. 
district courts, 1,713 entered federal prison, and 1,548 exited federal 
prison.

* The number of tribal law enforcement agencies reporting crime data to the 
FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting Program increased from 143 in 2010 to 158 in 
2012. 

* Tribes received $350,609 through the Bureau of Justice Assistance’s 2014 
Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. 

* BJS announced two opportunities in 2014, the National Criminal History 
Improvement Program and National Instant Criminal Background Check System Act 
Record Improvement Program, to improve tribal criminal history records and 
the reporting of persons prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm 
under state or federal law.
*******************************************************

The tribal justice system in Indian country varies across tribal nations and 
regions of the country. Criminal jurisdiction in Indian country—federally 
recognized reservations, tribal communities, and identified trust lands—
varies by type of crime committed, whether the offender or victim is a tribal 
member, and the state in which the offense occurred. Due to the sovereign 
status of federally recognized tribes in the United States, crimes committed 
in Indian country are often subject to concurrent jurisdiction between 
multiple criminal justice agencies.

Over 300 of the tribes in the United States are located in either mandatory 
or optional Public Law 280 jurisdictions. Public Law 83-280 (commonly 
referred to as Public Law 280 or P.L. 280) conferred jurisdiction from the 
federal government to six state governments: California, Minnesota (except 
the Red Lake Reservation), Nebraska, Oregon (except the Warm Springs 
Reservation), Wisconsin, and Alaska. These are mandatory P.L. 280 states. 
Public Law 280 also permitted other states to acquire jurisdiction either in 
whole or in part over Indian country within their boundaries: Nevada, Idaho, 
Iowa, Washington, South Dakota, Montana, North Dakota, Arizona, and Utah. In 
states where P.L. 280 does not apply, the federal government retains criminal 
jurisdiction for major crimes committed in Indian country.
***Footnote 3 Federal jurisdiction in Indian country is contained under the 
Indian Country Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 1152), and the Indian Country Major 
Crimes (18 U.S.C. § 1153) Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 13). The Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 expanded federal criminal 
jurisdiction in Indian country in such areas as guns, violent juveniles, 
drugs, and domestic violence.***

This report summarizes BJS’s effort to--

* enhance current state and local criminal justice statistics to include more 
information on agencies serving tribal lands

* provide progress updates for the 2014 National Survey of Tribal Counts 

* support tribal crime data reporting to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting 
(UCR) Program and calculate tribal award eligibility for the Edward Byrne 
Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program 

* study the handling of AIAN juvenile and adult criminal cases in the federal 
justice system 
enhance current funding programs to support tribal participation in state and 
national criminal justice databases (figure 1).

**************************************
Tribal data collections during 2014
**************************************

During FY 2014, BJS focused on improving its understanding of the role of 
state, local, and tribal justice agencies serving tribal lands. Current 
ongoing surveys were enhanced to incorporate items to measure the unique 
roles of law enforcement and prosecutors. In addition, BJS continues to 
prepare for a new census of tribal courts in the United States and to enhance 
other ongoing BJS efforts to improve Indian country justice statistics.

Law enforcement
*******************

The Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA) is conducted 
about every 4 years. CSLLEA provides data on the more than 18,000 state, 
local, and tribal law enforcement agencies operating in the U.S. CSLLEA 
captures agency data on the number of sworn and civilian personnel and the 
range of law enforcement functions each agency performs. The census collected 
data from about 178 tribal law enforcement agencies operating in Indian 
country in 2008 and about 171 in 2000. A new 2014 CSLLEA will be fielded in 
FY 2015.

To better understand the role played by nontribal state and local justice 
agencies with jurisdiction over Indian country or tribal lands, BJS is 
enhancing the 2014 CSLLEA to ask each of the more than 18,000 state and local 
law enforcement agencies surveyed if it provides services on tribal lands. 
From this census, BJS will generate a complete list of all state and local 
law enforcement offices that served tribal lands in 2014.

Based on data from the 2014 CSLLEA, BJS will conduct a more in-depth study of 
the activities of nontribal law enforcement agencies that service tribal 
lands. This new survey, the Census of State and Local Law Enforcement 
Agencies Serving Tribal Lands, will go into the field in 2015. It will 
document the administrative and operational structures and the tribal 
caseloads of these agencies. The survey will also gather information about 
the procedures in place for fighting crime on tribal lands based on federal 
mandates or consensual jurisdiction arrangements between tribal and state 
governments.

In 2014, NORC at the University of Chicago was selected as the data 
collection agent. The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), 
the National Sheriff’s Association (NSA), and the Association of Prosecuting 
Attorneys (APA) serve as consultants for the project. BJS is currently 
forming an expert panel comprised of state, local, and tribal law enforcement 
officers and prosecutors from P.L. 280 and non-P.L. 280 jurisdictions and 
Alaska to inform the survey design.

Prosecution
*******************

The 2014 National Survey of Prosecutors (NSP) will survey all of the 
estimated 2,400 state prosecutor offices litigating felony cases in state 
courts of general jurisdiction. The NSP will collect similar information to 
the 2007 census of prosecutors, including a modified Indian country section. 
The survey will gather data on caseloads, annual budgets, tenure, salaries, 
and office staffing (i.e., attorneys, investigators, victim advocates, and 
support personnel). If the office provides services to tribal lands, 
respondents will be asked to complete items that explore administrative and 
legal issues related to handling felony cases on tribal lands. The survey 
will contain a 1-page section focused on Indian country justice statistics, 
including the nature of the jurisdiction, sources of authority, case types, 
and reciprocity between tribal, state, and intergovernmental agreements.

BJS expects NSP data collection to begin in early 2015. The list of 
prosecutor offices serving tribal lands collected in the NSP will be used to 
conduct a more in-depth survey in 2015. BJS will conduct the Census of State 
and Local Prosecutors’ Offices Serving Tribal Lands to obtain more detailed 
information on administrative procedures and practices, tribal caseloads, 
provided services, and the capacity of the offices to report detailed data on 
the tribal matters they handle. NORC at the University of Chicago will serve 
as the data collection agent with the assistance of IACP, NSA, and APA.

Tribal courts in the United States
***********************************

In FY 2014, BJS continued the development of the 2014 National Survey of 
Tribal Court Systems (NSTCS). The NSTCS will be BJS’s first statistical 
collection focusing on tribal justice systems since 2002. Through the NSTCS, 
BJS will gather information on the administrative and operational 
characteristics of tribal justice systems (including budgets, staffing, 
caseloads and case processes), indigent defense services, pretrial and 
probation programs, protection orders and domestic violence, and juvenile 
cases; implementation of various enhanced sentencing provisions of the Tribal 
Law and Order Act (TLOA); and various indigenous or traditional dispute 
forums operating within Indian country.

In early 2014, BJS finalized a list of all known tribal courts. BJS worked 
with tribal justice professionals and experts to define the respondent 
universe of tribal courts. BJS and its data collection agent, Kauffman and 
Associates, identified approximately 426 courts or justice forums. The list 
can be found at www.tribalcourtsurvey.org.

BJS has developed three separate but compatible survey instruments customized 
to the various types of tribal courts:

* NSTCS–Lower 48 will focus on approximately 245 tribal courts in the lower 
48 states. The courts are located in non-P.L. 280 states (with federal 
jurisdiction for major crimes) and P.L. 280 states (in which major crime 
jurisdiction transferred to the states courts). In both types of courts, 
tribes may hold concurrent jurisdiction for crimes involving AIAN and primary 
jurisdiction for most civil matters occurring on tribal lands.

* NSTCS–Alaska will focus on about 152 Alaska tribal councils and courts that 
were excluded from the 2002 data collection on tribal justice systems. 
Compared with tribes in the lower 48 states, Alaska tribes tend to be 
smaller, less economically well off, geographically dispersed, and have less 
formally organized tribal courts. The tribes in Alaska reside in village 
areas, unlike tribes in the lower 48 states that reside on reservations.

* NSTCS–CFR will be the first BJS data collection that includes courts 
operated under the Court of Federal Regulation (CFR). A CFR court, using 
federal laws, generally acts as a tribe’s judicial system until the tribe 
establishes its own court. A CFR court is a trial court in which parties 
present their cases before a magistrate. Appeals may be taken from the trial 
court to the Court of Indian Appeals. About 29 CFR courts will receive the 
survey.

Several organizations have provided comments on the survey instruments, 
including the Department of Justice’s Office of Tribal Justice (OTJ), 
American Probation and Parole Association (APPA), Pretrial Institute (PI), 
Tribal Law and Policy Institute (TLPI), Indian Country Justice Partners 
(ICJP), and the Indian Country Highway Safety Program Administration. The 
organizations suggested additional items on pretrial service; probation, 
parole, and reentry programs; and convictions in tribal court for driving 
under the influence or driving while intoxicated. BJS anticipates data 
collection to begin in early 2015.

Jails in Indian country
***********************************

The Survey of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC) is BJS’s only national data 
collection that provides an annual source of data on the estimated 79 Indian 
country jails and detention facilities. BJS initiated the SJIC in 1998 as a 
component of the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ). The SJIC includes all known 
Indian country facilities operated by tribal authorities or the BIA.

The most recent survey collected data on the number of inmates and percentage 
of capacity occupied based on the average daily population, midyear 
population, and peak population in the facilities in June 2012. The survey 
also gathered information on staffing, offense types, and conviction status, 
and an addendum collected in-depth data on inmates, health services, and 
facility programs. The findings of the SJIC data are in Jails in Indian 
Country, 2012, (NCJ 242187, BJS web, June 2013. The report showed that the 
number of jails or detention centers operating in Indian country increased 
14.5%, from 69 facilities in 1998 to 79 in 2012. At midyear 2012, a total of 
2,364 inmates were confined in Indian country jails—a 5.6% increase from the 
2,239 inmates confined at midyear 2011. For the 79 tribal facilities 
operating in June 2012, the average expected length of stay for inmates was 5 
days. During FY 2014, BJS completed the 2013 SJIC. Results are expected to be 
released in August 2014.

American Indians in local jails
***********************************

BJS’s Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) collects data on the number of AIAN held 
in local jails and the number held for BIA. Jail Inmates at Midyear 2013 - 
Statistical Tables (NCJ 245350, BJS web, May 2014) presents estimates of the 
number of jail inmates at midyear 2013. In 2013, local jails held about 
10,200 AIAN inmates, or 1.4% of the total (731,208) jail inmate population at 
midyear. The ASJ does not provide information on tribal membership or 
affiliations for the AIAN inmates.

Federal justice statistics
***********************************

The Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP) provides annual data on 
workload, activities, and outcomes associated with federal criminal cases. It 
acquires information on all aspects of processing in the federal justice 
system, including arrests, initial prosecution decisions, referrals to courts 
or magistrates, court dispositions, sentencing outcomes, sentence length, and 
time served. FJSP collects data from the U.S. Marshals Service, the Executive 
Office for U.S. Attorneys, the U.S. Office of Probation and Pretrial 
Services, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the U.S. Sentencing 
Commission, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Through its Federal Justice 
Statistics Resource Center (FJSRC), BJS compiles comprehensive information 
describing suspects and defendants processed in the federal criminal justice 
system.

The FJSP provides data on AIAN derived from administrative records for select 
stages of the criminal justice system. During 2011 (the most recent federal 
data available), 2,658 AIAN were arrested and booked by federal law 
enforcement agencies, 1,254 were sentenced in U.S. district courts, 1,713 
entered federal prison, and 1,548 exited federal prison. At the end of FY 
2011, 3,609 AIAN were held in federal prison (1.8% of all prisoners). 
***Footnote 4 Generated using the Federal Criminal Case Processing Statistics 
(FCCPS) tool at http://www.bjs.gov, May 21, 2014. AIAN in these analyses 
include persons living on and off tribal lands and persons who are and are 
not tribal members.***

With funding from BJS, the Urban Institute has undertaken a special analysis 
of Indian country cases in the federal justice system using FJSP. The final 
report will focus on adult and juvenile cases processed in the federal system 
from FY 2009–11, and will update data presented on juvenile cases in the 
report, Tribal Youth in the Federal System, 1999–2008, 
NCJ 234218, BJS web, June 2011.

National Crime Victimization 
Survey (NCVS)
***********************************

The NCVS is the nation’s primary source of information on criminal 
victimization. The NCVS collects information on nonfatal crimes reported and 
not reported to the police against persons age 12 or older from a nationally 
representative sample of U.S. households. The annual Criminal Victimization 
reports publish victimization estimates of self-identified AIAN.
In October 2013, BJS released Criminal Victimization, 2012 (NCJ 243389, BJS 
web). From 2011 to 2012, the rate of violent victimization—rape or sexual 
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault—reported among AIAN 
remained relatively stable at 45.4 per 1,000 persons age 12 or older in 2011 
and 46.9 in 2012.

Understanding NCVS estimates of victimization among AIAN on tribal lands 
remains a concern for BJS. NCVS statistics on AIAN victimization are often 
misinterpreted to be referring to persons residing in Indian country or 
tribal lands, when NCVS data on AIAN refer to respondents who reside largely 
outside of Indian country. In addition, the NCVS does not determine if the 
self-identified AIAN has tribal membership or affiliation.

As part of the ongoing redesign of the NCVS, BJS is exploring
g the feasibility of adding new items to determine tribal membership and 
whether the victimization occurred on tribal lands. Based on current data, 
multiple years of data would be needed to provide reliable estimates on 
tribal membership and victimization on tribal lands.

***********************************
Tribal participation in national 
records and information systems
***********************************

During 2014, BJS continued to focus on improving tribal participation in 
national record and information systems by working to expand tribal reporting 
to the UCR Program, which increases tribal eligibility for JAG awards, and 
tribal funding eligibility for the National Criminal History Improvement 
Program (NCHIP) and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System 
(NICS) Act Record Improvement Program (NARIP).

Offenses reported by tribal law 
enforcement agencies
***********************************

The FBI asks law enforcement agencies to report eight crime types to the UCR: 
four violent crimes (i.e., murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated 
assault) and four property crimes (i.e., burglary, larceny-theft, motor 
vehicle theft, and arson). Beginning in 2009, BJS worked with the BIA, FBI, 
and tribes to increase tribal reporting to the UCR. Since that time, the 
overall number of tribal law enforcement agencies with identifiable crime 
data in the FBI’s UCR Program increased from 2008 to 2012. Among AIAN tribal 
law enforcement agencies with identifiable crime data, 158 agencies (compared 
to 12 in 2008) reported 12 months of offense information and had 
disaggregated data published in the FBI’s annual report, Crime in the United 
States, 2012. Tribal law enforcement agencies reported about 26,902 violent 
and property crimes (not including arson) occurring on tribal lands in 2012 
(tables 1 and 2).***Footnote 5 ?Data are based on the crimes reported to the 
BIA and tribal law enforcement agencies submitting 12 months of complete 
offense data. Those tribes providing less than 12 months of crime data to the 
UCR are not included in the aggregated total estimates provided in tables 1 
and 2***

In 2012, 81% of violent offenses reported by tribal law enforcement agencies 
could be traced back to the originating tribal reservation, up from 6% in 
2008. Among these offenses, the reporting tribal law enforcement agency was 
identified in the majority of all reports of murder and nonnegligent 
manslaughter (72%), forcible rape (89%), robbery (81%), and aggravated 
assault (80%) (not shown).

From 2008 to 2012, the proportion of property offenses reported by tribal law 
enforcement agencies that were traceable to the tribe increased from 13% to 
82% (not shown). Between 2008 and 2012, the number of property offenses known 
to tribal police and reported to the FBI increased 21%, from 17,524 to 
21,259.

Tribes and the Edward Byrne Memorial 
Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program
***********************************

A total of $3,276,838 was made available in 131 awards to tribal governments 
through the JAG Program from 2008 to 2014 (table 3). The Bureau of Justice 
Assistance administers the JAG Program. BJS calculates the JAG formula-based 
award amounts using specifications outlined in the legislation. JAG awards 
may be used for the following seven purpose areas: law enforcement; 
prosecution and courts; prevention and education; corrections and community 
corrections; drug treatment; planning, evaluation, and technology 
improvement; and crime victim and witness programs.

The total funds available for JAG have steadily decreased since 2009. The 
total 2014 JAG funding allocated to tribes was approximately $350,609, a 13% 
decrease from the $404,317 allocated in 2013. The overall number of tribes 
eligible for JAG awards decreased from 21 in 2013 to 18 in 2014.

The five largest JAG allocations to tribal governments in 2014 were awarded 
to the Navajo Nation ($75,262), Rosebud ($41,362), Minnesota Chippewa Tribe 
($19,249), Standing Rock Sioux Tribe ($18,942), and Three Affiliated Tribes 
of the Fort Berthold Reservation ($17,006).

National Criminal History Improvement 
Program (NCHIP) and Indian country
***********************************

In 2014, BJS announced the continuation of the NCHIP program. Federally 
recognized tribal governments are eligible to apply, and tribes may submit 
applications as part of a multi-tribe consortium. NCHIP serves as an umbrella 
for various record improvement activities and funding sources, each of which 
has unique goals and objectives. BJS strongly encourages states and tribes to 
ensure the integrated functioning of record improvement initiatives, 
regardless of the funding source.

The goal of the NCHIP program is to improve the nation’s safety and security 
by enhancing the quality, completeness, and accessibility of criminal history 
record information by ensuring the nationwide implementation of criminal 
justice and noncriminal justice background check systems. Despite the 
tremendous progress made toward criminal record improvements among states, 
several significant shortcomings remain among tribal justice agencies.

BJS has identified several limitations confronting tribal nations. Most 
tribes do not have the capabilities or requisite technologies to support the 
transmittal of records to the national systems, either through their own 
infrastructure or via the state. Additionally, many tribes have not yet 
converted their manual or other nonautomated records to electronic versions. 
Some entities are not yet submitting qualifying records to the National Crime 
Information Center (NCIC) Protection Order File, and the FBI reports 
continued problems with the appropriate flagging of protection orders 
regarding the prohibition for firearm purchases.

National Instant Criminal Background 
Check System (NICS) Act Record 
Improvement Program (NARIP)
***********************************

In 2014, BJS announced the continuation of the NARIP program. Federally 
recognized Indian tribal governments are eligible to apply. The NARIP program 
was enacted to address provisions of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 
2007 (NIAA). The NARIP helps states and tribal governments  identify 
individuals prohibited by federal law from possessing firearms. 

NIAA provides that grants shall be made to each state or tribal government, 
consistent with plans for the integration, automation, and accessibility of 
criminal history records, for use by the court systems to improve automation 
and transmittal to federal and state repositories of 1) criminal history 
dispositions; 2) records relevant to determining whether a person has been 
convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence or whether a person is 
a subject of a prohibiting domestic violence protection order; and 3) 
prohibiting mental health adjudications and commitments.

The NARIP program aims to improve the completeness, automation, and 
transmittal of records to federal and state systems used by NICS by 
addressing the information gap about prohibiting mental health adjudications, 
commitments, and other factors. Filling these information gaps will better 
enable the system to prevent persons prohibited by federal or state law from 
receiving or possessing firearms. The automation of records will also help 
reduce delays for law-abiding gun purchasers.
