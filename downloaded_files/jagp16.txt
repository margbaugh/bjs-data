Technical Report

Justice Assistance Grant Program, 2016

Alexia D. Cooper, Ph.D., BJS Statistician

****************
Introduction
****************

As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, the 108th
Congress merged the discretionary Edward Byrne Memorial Grant
Program with the formula-based Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program 
to establish the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance
Grant (JAG) program. The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) administers 
the JAG program, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) calculates 
the JAG formula-based award amounts using specifications outlined 
in the legislation.

JAG awards may be used for the following seven purposes--

* law enforcement

* prosecution and courts

* prevention and education

* corrections and community corrections

* drug treatment

* planning, evaluation, and technology improvement

* crime victim and witness programs.

A total of $274,906,565 was available for the 2016 JAG awards 
(figure 1). This report describes the steps in the JAG award 
calculation process and presents summary results of the 2016
JAG formula calculations.

*************************************************
*************
Highlights
**************

* The total allocation for the 2016 JAG funding was approximately
$274.9 million, of which $268.2 million went to states and $6.7 
million to U.S. territories and the District of Columbia. 

* The five states with the largest total allocations included 
California ($30.5 million), Texas ($21.4 million), Florida 
($17.8 million), New York ($15.6 million), and Illinois 
($10.4 million).

* A total of 1,501 local governments were eligible for awards, 
either directly or through a joint award with other governments 
within their county. The five local governments eligible to receive 
the largest awards were New York City ($4.3 million), Chicago 
($2.1 million), Houston ($1.7 million), Philadelphia 
($1.7 million), and Los Angeles ($1.4 million).

* Two states had 100 or more local governments eligible 
to receive award funds either directly or through 
a shared award, California (214) and Florida (118).
*************************************************

*********************
Overview of process
*********************

Once the fiscal year (FY) JAG allocation has been determined, 
BJS begins its four-step award calculation process:

* Computing an initial allocation for each state and U.S.
 territory, based on its share of violent crime and population 
(weighted equally).

* Reviewing the initial allocation amount to determine if it 
is less than the minimum (de minimus) award amount defined 
in the JAG legislation (0.25% of the total). If this is the 
case, the state or U.S. territory is funded at the minimum 
level, and the funds required for this are deducted from 
the overall pool of funds. Each of the remaining states 
receives the minimum award plus an additional amount based 
on its share of violent crime and population.

* Dividing each state’s final amount at a rate of 60% for 
state governments and 40% for local governments.

* Determining local award allocations, which are based on a 
jurisdiction’s proportion of the state’s 3-year violent 
crime average. If a local jurisdiction’s calculated award 
is less than $10,000, the funds are returned to the state 
to distribute. If the calculated local award is $10,000
or more, then the local government is eligible to apply 
for an award.

****************************************
The four-step award calculation process
****************************************

Step 1: Initial allocation to U.S. states and territories
******************************************************

[Legislative mandate: 42 USC § 3755 (a)(1)]

Using the congressional appropriation and formula for the 
2016 JAG program, BJS calculates the initial allocation 
amounts for the 50 states and U.S. territories. BJS allocates 
half of the available funds using a state or U.S. territory’s 
share of violent crime and half of the funds using its share 
of the nation’s population.  ***Footnote 1 1For purposes 
of the initial calculations for the 2016 state and U.S. 
territory allocations, the FBI legacy definition of rape 
was used for the 2014 violent crime total to maintain 
consistency within the 3-year violent crime average. 
See Methodology.*** The most recent 3-year period of 
official violent crime data for states and U.S. territories 
from the FBI covered the period between 2011 and 2013. The 
population shares for the 50 states, the District of Columbia, 
and U.S. territories were determined based on the results 
of the 2015 midyear population estimates published by the 
U.S. Census Bureau.

Examples--

* California accounts for 12.89% of the nation’s total violent crime 
and 12.03% of the nation’s total population. Therefore, California’s 
initial allocation equals 12.89% of $137,453,283 (half of 
$274,906,565) plus 12.03% of $137,453,283, totaling $34,255,164. 

* Wyoming accounts for 0.10% of the nation’s total violent crime 
and 0.18% of the nation’s total population. Wyoming’s initial 
allocation is 0.10% of $137,453,283 plus 0.18% of $137,453,283, 
totaling $380,324.

Step 2: De minimus awards
***************************

[Legislative mandate: 42 USC § 3755(a)(2)]

The JAG legislation requires that each state or U.S. territory 
be awarded a minimum allocation equal to 0.25% of the total JAG 
allocation ($687,266 in 2016), regardless of its population or 
crime average. If a state or U.S. territory’s initial allocation 
based on crime and population is less than the minimum amount, 
that state or U.S. territory receives the minimum award amount 
as its total JAG allocation. If a state or U.S. territory’s 
initial allocation exceeds the minimum amount, it receives 
the minimum award plus the amount based on its share of the 
violent crime and population.

Congress has made one exception to this rule: American Samoa 
and the Northern Mariana Islands are required to split one 
minimum award, with American Samoa receiving 67% ($460,468) 
and the Northern Mariana Islands receiving 33% ($226,798). 
(See Methodology.)

In 2016, four states (North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, and
Wyoming) and four U.S. territories (American Samoa, Guam, Northern 
Mariana Islands, and the Virgin Islands) received only the minimum 
award as their total JAG allocation. The remainder of the states, 
the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico were all awarded the minimum 
award plus an additional allocation. A total of $37,799,653 was 
allocated for minimum awards under the 2016 JAG program, leaving 
$237.1 million to be allocated based on the states’ share 
of population and violent crime.

Examples--

* Wyoming’s initial allocation of $380,324 is less than the minimum 
value, so Wyoming’s total JAG allocation will be the minimum amount 
of $687,266.

* California’s initial allocation of $34,255,164 exceeds the minimum 
value, so California will receive the minimum plus an award based on 
its share of total violent crime and population.

To compute the additional amounts, the crime and population data for 
states and U.S. territories receiving only the minimum award are 
removed from the pool, and the remaining JAG funds are reallocated 
to the rest of the states based on violent crime and population 
as in Step 1. 

Examples--

* Wyoming receives only the minimum award, so its crime and population 
data are removed from the pool.

* After removing the crime and population data for the states and
U.S. territories receiving only the minimum award, California 
accounts for 12.96% of violent crime and 12.15% of the nation’s 
population. California’s new JAG allocation is equal to $15,360,486 
(12.96% of half of $237.1 million) plus $14,409,349 (12.15% of half 
of $237.1 million), plus the minimum amount of $687,266. These 
three components equal $30,457,101. ($237.1 million equals the 
original $274.9 million total JAG 2016 award allocation minus 
the $37.8 million JAG 2016 minimum allocation.) 

Step 3: 60%/40% split to state and local governments
*****************************************************

[Legislative mandate: 42 USC § 3755(b)]

Except for the U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, 
60% of the total allocation to a state is retained by the state 
government, and 40% is set aside to be allocated to local governments.

Examples--

* California’s state government retains 60% of $30,457,101,
or $18,274,260. The remaining 40%, or $12,182,840, is set 
aside for distribution to local governments in California.

* Wyoming’s state government retains 60% of the minimum award 
of $687,266, or $412,359. The remaining 40%, or 274,907, is 
set aside for distribution to local governments in Wyoming.


Step 4: Determining local award allocations
*********************************************

[Legislative mandate: 42 USC § 3755(c)(d)(e)(f)(g)(h)]

To allocate local awards, BJS determines which jurisdictions should 
be included in the calculation of the 3-year violent crime averages 
on which local awards are based. These crime averages are computed 
using data reported to the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. 
To be eligible, a jurisdiction must have provided to the UCR a count of 
the number of Part I violent crimes known to law enforcement each year 
for a minimum of 3 years in the past 10 years. *** Footnote 2 2For purposes 
of the 2016 local award calculations, Part I violent crime totals included 
the definition of rape (legacy or 2013 revised) that an agency reported 
to the FBI. See Methodology.*** Jurisdictions that have not met the reporting 
requirements are excluded from the calculations and are not eligible to 
receive an award.

The 10-year limit on the age of UCR data used for JAG local award calculations 
was applied for the first time during the 2009 Recovery Act. ***Footnote 3 Before 
2009, all years of the FBI’s UCR data could be used to meet the 3-year reporting 
requirement. Although the 10-year limit was stipulated in the 2005 legislation that 
created the JAG program, it was not implemented until 2009 per the “Transitional 
Rule.” See 42 USC § 3755(d)(2)(B).*** For the 2010 JAG, the 10-year window for 
eligible UCR data was waived because some agencies were having difficulty meeting 
the new requirements. Instead, all of the FBI’s UCR data dating back to 1991 were 
used to meet the 3-year reporting requirement. Agencies that used this waiver signed 
an agreement indicating they would begin to report timely data on Part I violent 
crimes to the FBI starting no later than the end of FY 2010 (September 30, 2010). 
All agencies that used the waiver in 2010 reported updated UCR data by the required 
deadline, making it unnecessary to authorize any further waivers of the 10-year rule. 
The 10-year limit was applied for the first time in FY 2012 and has been in effect
for each year since.

After determining which law enforcement agencies have the 3 years of reported 
violent crime data required to be included in the calculations, BJS computes 
the average number of violent crimes reported by all law enforcement agencies 
in each jurisdiction, such as local government, for the 3 most recent years 
in which they reported data.

Since awards to local governments are based on their share of all
violent crimes reported by the law enforcement agencies in their
state, BJS computes the sum of these averages within each state 
to determine the jurisdiction’s share of the total local award allocation. 

Examples--

* California has $12.2 million set aside for local awards. 
The 3-year violent crime averages reported by local jurisdictions 
in California equal 152,220.67 crimes. Dividing the $12.2 million 
set-aside by the state crime total (152,220.67) results in the 
number of dollars available for each crime ($80.03). Therefore, 
a local California jurisdiction needs a 3-year violent crime average 
of at least 124.95 violent crimes ($10,000 divided by $80.03) 
to be eligible for a direct award.

* Wyoming has $274,907 set aside for local governments. The sum of 
3-year average violent crimes reported is 1138.67. The dollars per 
crime ratio in Wyoming equals $274,907 divided by 1138.67 crimes, 
or $247.43 per crime (after rounding). The threshold is 41.42 violent 
crimes ($10,000 divided by $247.43) to be eligible for a direct award.

BJS then calculates the initial amount of each local award. Each local 
award amount is equal to the product of a local jurisdiction’s 3-year 
violent crime average and the dollars per crime ratio for the state in 
which it is located. By statute, the minimum award a local jurisdiction 
may receive is $10,000. Jurisdictions that are eligible for an initial 
award greater than or equal to $10,000 are eligible to apply to receive 
the funds for their own use. If the initial award is less than $10,000, 
the award funds are transferred to the state administering agency for 
distribution to the state police or any units of local government that 
were ineligible for a direct award greater than or equal to $10,000. 
(See “Pass-through requirement” [42 USC § 3755(c)].)

Examples--

* The city of Los Angeles, California, has a 3-year average of 18,080.67 
violent crimes, or about 12.0% of all violent crimes reported by potentially 
eligible jurisdictions in California. Los Angeles exceeds the state 
threshold of 124.95 violent crimes and is eligible for 12.0% of the 
$12.2 million set aside for local governments in California, or about 
$1,447,069 (18,080.67 multiplied by $80.03).

* The town of Pine Bluffs, Wyoming, has a 3-year average of 5.67 
violent crimes. This does not meet the state threshold of 41.42, 
so it is ineligible for a direct JAG award. Its crimes, less than 
1.0% of all violent crimes in Wyoming, account for about $1,368 
of award funds. These funds are transferred to the state for 
redistribution.

***************************************
Results of the calculations for the 
2016 JAG program
***************************************

For the 2016 JAG awards, approximately $268.2 million of the
$274.9 million available was allocated to the 50 states, 
with the remainder allocated to the District of Columbia 
and U.S. territories (table 1). As required by the legislation, 
40% of this amount ($107.3 million) was initially reserved for 
local governments. A total of 1,501 local governments had law 
enforcement agencies with a sufficient number of Part 1 violent 
crimes that were reported to the FBI to receive a JAG award--either 
directly or through a joint award with other governments within 
their county. These local governments were eligible for a collective 
total of $86.4 million. The balance of unawarded local allocations 
($20.9 million) was returned to state governments for redistribution 
to state law enforcement agencies and local governments.

Two states had 100 or more local governments eligible to receive 
award funds either directly or through a shared award, California 
(214) and Florida (118). The five local governments eligible to 
receive the largest awards were New York City ($4.3 million), 
Chicago ($2.1 million), Houston ($1.7 million), Philadelphia 
($1.7 million), and Los Angeles ($1.4 million).

In addition, the District of Columbia was eligible for $1.7 million 
and Puerto Rico was eligible for $2.9 million (table 2). Guam and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands were each eligible for the minimum award 
of $687,266. American Samoa ($460,468) and the Northern Mariana Islands 
($226,798) split one minimum award.

Additional JAG provisions
************************** 

Disparate jurisdictions and joint allocations
***********************************************

[Legislative mandate: 42 USC § 3755 (d)(3)(4)]

In some cases, as defined by the legislation, a disparity 
may exist between the funding eligibility of a county and 
its associated municipalities. Three different types 
of disparities may exist.

The first type is a zero-county disparity. This situation 
exists when one or more municipalities within a county are 
eligible for a direct award and the county is not, yet the 
county is responsible for providing criminal justice services 
(such as prosecution and incarceration) for the municipality. 
In this case, the county is entitled to part of the municipality’s
award because it shares the cost of criminal justice operations, 
although it may not report crime data to the FBI. This is the 
most common type of disparity.

Example--

* Lansing City, Michigan, is eligible for an award of $95,990. 
Ingham County, Michigan (which includes the city of Lansing), 
is not eligible for a direct award, but it provides criminal 
justice services to Lansing. In this case, Ingham County and 
Lansing are considered zero-county disparate. Lansing must 
share its award funds with Ingham County as mutually agreed 
upon.

A second type of disparity exists when both a county and 
a municipality within that county qualify for a direct 
award, yet the award amount for the municipality exceeds 
150% of the county’s award amount.

Example--

* Pima County, Arizona, is eligible for a direct award of $62,574. 
The city of Tucson in Pima County is eligible for a direct award of 
$310,484. Tucson’s award amount is more than 150% of Pima County’s 
award amount. Consequently, the two governments’ awards are 
pooled together ($373,058) and shared as mutually agreed upon. 

The third type of disparity occurs when a county and multiple 
municipalities within that county are all eligible for direct 
awards, but the sum of the awards for the individual 
municipalities exceeds 400% of the county’s award amount. 
In the 2016 JAG calculations, this type of disparity only 
occurred with another type of disparity within the same county. 
An example of a situation in which this was the only type of disparity 
within a county is available in Justice Assistance 
Grant (JAG) Program, 2014, (NCJ 247137, BJS web, August 2014).

These three types of disparity are examined in order. If a 
municipality is found to be disparate in one of these three 
ways, its award is not included in calculations to test other 
disparity situations. For instance, if a municipality is 
found to be 150% disparate with the county, its award is set 
aside, and the rest of the municipalities within the same county 
are checked for 400% disparity. If no other disparity is found, the 
single municipality and county share the sum of their two awards. 
However, it is possible for a county to have both a 150% disparity 
and a 400% disparity simultaneously. For instance, counties can 
have one or more municipalities whose individual awards are more 
than 150% of the county’s award and other municipalities whose 
combined award is more than 400% of the county’s award.

Examples--

* Alameda County, California, is eligible for an award of $50,341. 
The cities of Alameda ($12,352), Berkeley ($39,483), Emeryville ($11,311), 
Fremont ($23,023), Hayward ($48,207), Livermore ($21,529), Newark 
($10,698), Oakland ($609,780), San Leandro ($32,014), and Union ($17,607) 
(all located in Alameda County) are also all eligible for awards. 
The award for Oakland ($609,780) is individually more than 150% of Alameda 
County’s award, so Oakland’s award will be pooled together with the 
county’s award. The other nine cities’ awards sum to $216,224. 
This summed amount is more than 400% of Alameda County’s direct award 
of $50,341. As a result, the funds for all 11 jurisdictions ($876,345) 
are pooled together 
and must be shared.

* Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, is eligible for an award of $12,044. 
The jurisdictions of McKeesport ($39,629), Pittsburgh ($232,988), Wilkinsburg 
($15,475), and Penn Hills ($14,586), are also eligible 
for awards. The award amount for Pittsburgh is more than 150% of 
the award amount for Allegheny County. The award amount for
McKeesport is also more than 150% of the award amount of the county. 
These two jurisdictions are disparate with the county, and the three 
jurisdictions will share the combined total of $284,661. The remaining 
jurisdictions of Wilkinsburg and Penn Hills are individually less than 
150% of the award amount for Allegheny County, and the two awards combined 
are less than 400% of the County’s award. Accordingly, 
they are eligible for direct awards, and the awards for these two 
cities will remain separate.

For disparate situations, regardless of the type, the total of all 
award funds for the separate units of local governments (counties and 
municipalities) are pooled together and split among the units of local 
government as agreed upon by the affected jurisdictions. To qualify 
for payment, the disparate units of local government must submit a 
joint application for the aggregated funds.


Pass-through requirement
***************************

[Legislative mandate: 42 USC § 3755]

According to the JAG legislation, states may only retain award amounts 
that bear the same ratio of “(A) total expenditures on criminal justice
by the state government in the most recently completed fiscal 
year to (B) the total expenditure on criminal justice by the state 
government and units of local government within the state in such year.”

The determination of proportionate criminal justice spending by state 
and local governments is referred to as the variable pass-through (VPT) 
process under JAG. The VPT process identifies the amounts each state must 
pass down to local governments within the state.

During 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau finished compiling the most recent 
criminal justice expenditure information (from FY 2010) to calculate 
updated VPT amounts. Several sources of data were used to calculate 
the percentages, including initial expenditure data from the 2010 
Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances conducted by the U.S. 
Census Bureau (http://www.census.gov/govs/local/historical_data_2010.html)
and federal justice grant data from the Federal Award Assistance Data 
System (http://www.census.gov/govs/www/faads.html). Source data were assigned to 
state and local governments. Intergovernmental expenditures and grants were 
removed from the total justice expenditure for the appropriate type 
of government. The resulting expenditure data were then used to calculate 
the VPT percentages by comparing the total justice expenditures of all 
local governments in a state to the expenditures of the state government 
itself. A simple percentage resulted, which represented the combined 
local government expenditures within the state divided by the total 
state criminal justice expenditures. These updated VPT percentages 
were used for the 2016 JAG program and can be found on the BJA website 
at https://www.bja.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?Program_ID=59.

Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act 
penalty and compliance bonus funds
***********************************************

[Legislative mandate: 42 USC § 16925 (a)(c)]


Penalty
*********

The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 
Title I of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act 
of 2006, required that the 50 states, the District of Columbia, 
the five principal U.S. territories, and some federally recognized 
tribes substantially implement SORNA by July 27, 2009. Two full-year 
deadline extensions were provided, and a final statutory deadline 
of July 27, 2011, was established. SORNA mandated a 10% reduction 
in JAG funding for any jurisdictions that failed to substantially 
implement SORNA by the deadline. For those jurisdictions that failed 
to meet this deadline, the SORNA penalty was calculated by subtracting 
10% from the state government’s allocation (60% of the total award), 
after deducting the mandatory VPT that states are required to send 
to local governments. The penalty applies to the portion of JAG funding 
that is returned to the state to be shared with local governments that 
were not eligible for a direct JAG award (less than $10,000 jurisdictions). 

The penalty does not apply to the VPT, which is the portion 
of JAG funds awarded directly to local law enforcement, as 
the state cannot retain any portion of that award. Penalizing 
local agencies would also seriously undermine the purpose of the 
statute, since doing so would be detrimental to local law enforcement 
efforts, including the investigation, prosecution, and apprehension 
of sex offenders. An example of how the SORNA penalty was assessed 
can be found in BJA’s JAG Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on the 
BJA website at https://www.bja.gov/Funding/JAGFAQ.pdf.

In FY 2016, a total of 36 states and U.S. territories were 
not compliant with SORNA’s requirements. As a result, these 
jurisdictions received a combined $6,168,218 reduction to their 
FY 2016 Byrne JAG award. These jurisdictions were allowed to 
apply to reallocate the 10% penalty to promote SORNA implementation. 
Six states were SORNA noncompliant and did not apply to reallocate 
the penalty. Per the SORNA legislation, the $1,003,487 withheld from 
these jurisdictions will be reallocated to jurisdictions that 
did substantially implement SORNA [(42 USC § 16925(c)]. These funds 
will be reallocated to compliant states as part of the 
FY 2017 JAG award.


Bonus funds from FY 2015
***************************

Per 42 USC § 16925(c), any state or U.S. territory that 
has substantially implemented SORNA during the current fiscal 
year, as determined by the Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, 
Monitoring, Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking (SMART), 
will be eligible to receive compliant bonus funds in addition 
to its JAG award for the following year. This bonus allocation 
is calculated using SORNA penalty funds from nonimplementing states
and U.S. territories during the current fiscal year. For example, 
any state that substantially implemented SORNA in FY 2015 would 
have bonus funds added to its FY 2016 state JAG award, made up 
of SORNA penalty funds from nonimplementing states and U.S. 
territories in FY 2015. The amounts available for compliant bonus
funds will vary from year to year, depending on the amount of SORNA 
penalty funds from the previous year.

Bonus funds are allocated using the same general approach as the 
overall JAG award allocation calculations. First, an initial 
allocation is calculated for each eligible state and 
U.S. territory using its share of violent crime and 
population (weighted equally). Next, this initial allocation 
is reviewed to determine if it is less than the minimum award 
amount (defined as 0.25% of the total funds available). If this 
is the case, the state or U.S. territory is allocated 0.25% of the total 
funds available, and the funds required for this are deducted from the 
overall pool of funds. These states and U.S. territories are then 
removed from the calculations. Each of the remaining states receives 
the minimum award plus an additional amount based on its share of violent 
crime and population for the remaining states and U.S. territories.

For FY 2016, a total of $1,038,782 was available from the FY 2015 
SORNA reductions from the noncompliant states. These funds were 
distributed to the 20 states and U.S. territories that substantially 
implemented SORNA during the fiscal year. Of the 20 states eligible 
for bonus funds, Florida ($203,389) and Pennsylvania ($113,613) 
received the largest awards (table 3). Of the eligible U.S. territories,
the U.S. Virgin Islands received $2,597, Guam received $2,597, 
and the Northern Mariana Islands received $857.

Prison Rape Elimination Act certification 
reduction and bonus funds
*****************************************

[Legislative mandate: 42 USC § 15607(e)]

Reduction
***********

The Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) statute dictates that a state 
whose governor does not certify full compliance with the U.S. 
Department of Justice (DOJ) National Standards to Prevent, 
Detect, and Respond to Prison Rape, 42 U.S.C. 15607(e), is 
subject to the loss of 5% of any DOJ grant funds that it would 
otherwise receive for prison purposes, unless the governor submits 
to the Attorney General an assurance that such 5% will be used 
only to enable the state to adopt and achieve full 
compliance with the National PREA Standards in future years.

For those without a certification of full compliance, the PREA reduction 
was calculated by subtracting 5% from the state government’s allocation 
(60% of the total award), after deducting the VPT that states 
are required to send to local governments. The reduction applies 
to the portion of JAG funding returned to the state to be shared 
with local governments that were not eligible for a direct JAG award 
(less than $10,000 jurisdictions).

The reduction does not apply to the VPT, which is the portion of JAG 
funds awarded directly to local law enforcement, as the state cannot 
retain any portion of that award. An example of how the PREA reduction 
was assessed can be found in BJA’s JAG program FAQ regarding the PREA
 certification requirement and 5% reduction FAQ located on the BJA 
website at https://www.bja.gov/Programs/JAG-PREA-FAQ.pdf.

For FY 2016, 39 states, District of Columbia, and 5 U.S. territories 
were not compliant with PREA requirements. As a result, these jurisdictions 
suffered a combined $3,877,473 reduction to their FY 2016 Byrne JAG award. 
These jurisdictions were allowed to apply to reallocate the 5% reduction 
to achieve compliance with PREA standards and become certified. Two states 
and two U.S. territories were PREA noncompliant and did not apply to 
reallocate the reduction. Per the PREA legislation, the $150,562 withheld 
from these jurisdictions was reallocated to jurisdictions that either were 
certified or were working to achieve certification.

Bonus funds
************

PREA bonus funds are allocated using the same general approach 
as the overall JAG award allocation calculations. First, an 
initial allocation is calculated for each eligible state and 
U.S. territory, using its share of violent crime and population 
(weighted equally). Next, the initial allocation is reviewed 
to determine if it is less than the minimum award amount (0.25% 
of the total funds available). If this is the case, the state 
or U.S. territory is allocated 0.25% of the total funds available, 
and the funds required for this are deducted from the overall pool 
of funds. These states and U.S. territories are then removed from 
the calculations. Each of the remaining states receives the minimum 
award plus an additional amount based on its share of 
violent crime and population for the remaining states and U.S. 
territories.

For the FY 2016 JAG awards, a total of $150,562 was available 
from PREA reductions from the four noncompliant states and U.S. 
territories that did not apply to reallocate the reduction. 
These funds were distributed to the states, the District of 
Columbia, and U.S. territories that were PREA certified or were 
working to become certified. Of the states that were eligible 
for bonus funds, California ($17,134) and Texas ($12,048) 
received the largest awards (table 4). Of the eligible U.S. 
territories, Puerto Rico ($1,608) received the largest bonus award.

bonus funds, including implementation requirements and a list

Maximum allocation to units 
of local government
******************************

[Legislative mandate: 42 USC § 3755(e)(1)]

According to the legislation, units of local government may 
not receive a JAG award that “exceeds such unit’s total 
expenditures on criminal justice services for the most recently 
completed fiscal year for which data are available.” 
Award amounts in excess of total expenditures “shall be allocated 
proportionately among units of local government whose allocations 
do not exceed their total expenditures on such services.”

***************
Methodology
***************

The population data used to calculate state and U.S. 
territory Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) allocations 
are from the 2015 census estimates provided to the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS) by the U.S. Census Bureau. 
The state-level violent crime data are estimates 
published by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) 
program in its annual publication, Crime in the United States. 
The 2016 JAG program used state-level crime data for 
the years 2012 through 2014.


The UCR program also provided the crime data used to calculate 
local JAG allocation amounts. BJS obtained data for local 
jurisdictions in electronic format directly from the FBI 
and processed the data to link each crime-reporting entity 
to a local government. The 2016 JAG used local crime data 
from 2005 through 2014.

The sum of the UCR violent crimes for all local governments  
within a state for a given year will not equal the estimated 
crime total published by the FBI for that state. These state-level 
estimates are based on crimes reported by all state, local, and 
special district law enforcement agencies within a state, plus an 
imputation adjustment to account for nonreporting agencies and 
agencies reporting less than 12 months of data. These imputed 
values do not appear on the electronic data file that 
BJS used and are not used to calculate the local award.

UCR modification to the definition of rape
*******************************************

Historically, the UCR program defined rape as “the carnal knowledge 
of a female forcibly and against her will.” Many agencies recognized 
that this definition excludes a long list of sex offenses that are 
criminal in most jurisdictions, such as offenses involving oral 
or anal penetration, penetration with objects, and rapes of males. 
Because these sex offenses were excluded, the UCR rape data 
represented an undercount of rape known to law enforcement.

To be more inclusive and increase accuracy in the scope and volume 
of rape, in December 2011, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III approved 
revisions to the UCR’s 80-year-old definition of rape. The new definition 
(referred to as the revised definition) was broadened to “penetration, 
no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, 
or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent 
of the victim.”*** Footnote 4 Frequently asked questions about the 
revised definition of rape are available at 
https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/recent-programupdates/
new-rape-definition-frequentlyasked-questions.***

The new definition was approved in 2011, and the FBI encouraged 
agencies to begin reporting data using the revised definition 
starting on January 1, 2013. However, in 2013, some agencies reported 
rape counts using only the legacy definition, while other agencies 
reported data using only the revised definition. Accordingly, the FBI 
chose to report rape counts collected under both definitions in the 
Crime in the United States (CIUS) publication. The published 2013 
and 2014 violent crime totals were created using the revised definition. 
However, to be consistent with prior years, the legacy definition of 
rape was used to calculate the violent crime counts in any tables 
that showed trend data (multiyear estimates).

For the initial part of the JAG calculations, which determines the 
initial allocation to each state and how much is available for local 
awards within each state, the formula uses the most recent 3 years 
of crime data as published by the FBI. Therefore, to be consistent 
with the totals published in CIUS, BJS used the FBI’s legacy rape counts 
for the first part of the formula. BJS will begin using the revised 
rape counts once there are 3 years of published revised rape counts, 
which is anticipated to occur in 2017.

For local award allocations, BJS uses an electronic data file provided 
by the FBI. The file includes agency-level counts of homicide, rape, robbery, 
and aggravated assault that are summed together to create the violent crime 
total used in the formula. Unlike the estimates published in CIUS, the 
electronic file has only a single category for rape for each agency. This 
category reflects the counts provided by the agency but does not indicate 
which definition of rape was reported. This variable was used in the 
2016 JAG calculations for local awards.

For additional information on the UCR program’s changes to the
definition of rape and how the changes affects CIUS, contact the 
FBI’s UCR program via email at crimestatsinfo@
ic.fbi.gov.


Allocations to U.S. territories
*********************************

Puerto Rico was the only U.S. territory to receive an initial allocation 
larger than the minimum amount, and it was also the only U.S. territory 
for which violent crime data were available. The JAG calculations 
for the other U.S. territories were based solely on population data. 
Because the other U.S. territories have relatively small 
populations (none exceeding 162,000), it is unlikely the inclusion 
of crime data would have changed their minimum status.

The current JAG legislation specifies that 40% of the total allocation 
for Puerto Rico be set aside for local awards. However, as of 2016, 
the local-level UCR data provided by the FBI did not include any crime 
data for local jurisdictions in Puerto Rico. Therefore, the local 
government JAG program allocation in Puerto Rico was $0.
