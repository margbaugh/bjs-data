On June 30, 2000, a total of 69 jails,
confinement facilities, detention centers, or
other correctional facilities were supervising 
1,799 persons in Indian country, an increase of 
6% from the previous year.  At midyear 1999, 
1,693 persons were under the supervision of 
jails in Indian country.

Indian country facilities held 1,775 inmates at
midyear 2000, up from 1,621 at midyear 1999.  
Jail authorities also supervised 24 offenders 
in alternative programs outside the jail 
facilities.

The 69 facilities had a rated capacity 
to hold 2,076 persons.  On June 30, 2000,
they were operating at 86% of capacity, up
from 78% at midyear 1999.  On their peak
day in June 2000, the 69 jails were operating
at 118% capacity, up from 111% in 1999. 
Seventeen jails reported plans to increase
capacity by 1,108 beds before July 2003.

These data are based on the 2000 Survey
of Jails in Indian Country (SJIC).  The
survey includes all jails, confinement
facilities, detention centers, and other
correctional facilities located in Indian
country and operated by tribal authorities 
or the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). 
The survey gathers information on the
number of persons in custody, the number
under community supervision, offender
characteristics, and facility capacity.

Tribes retain jurisdiction over many
crimes by American Indians and Alaska
Natives in Indian country

Thirty-three States contain around 300 
Indian land areas or reservations.  Generally, 
the local governing authority on an Indian 
lands is a tribal government or council.  
Jurisdiction over crimes in Indian country 
depends on several factors, including the identity
of the victim and the offender, the severity of
the crime, and where the crime was committed.  
Tribal authority to sentence offenders is limited 
to 1 year or less of imprisonment and a $5,000 
fine (25 U.S.C. sec.1302(7)). 
                         
City or county jails held over 3 times as many
American Indians as jails in Indian country.
(American Indians in this report includes 
Alaska Natives.)  At midyear 2000 local jails 
held an estimated 5,500 American Indians,  
some of whom may have been adjudicated by a tribal
criminal justice system and housed in jails under
contract with tribal governments.  Overall, State, 
Federal, local, and tribal authorities were supervising 
47,828 American Indians.  Most were under 
community supervision (27,590).

A total of 20,238 American Indians were in 
custody at midyear 2000,  most of whom were 
held in State prisons (11,085).
                         
On April 1, 2000, 2,475,956 American 
Indians and Alaska Natives lived in the 
United States.***Footnote 1: U.S. Census 
Bureau, 2000 of Population and Housing.***   
American Indians account for under 1% of 
the U.S. resident population and around 
1% of those in custody of jails or prisons.  
At midyear 2000 the rate of incarceration 
for American Indians was about 15% higher 
than the overall national rate.  Federal 
and State prison and jail authorities held 
818 American Indians per 100,000 Indians, 
compared to 702 persons of all races per  
100,000 U.S. residents.***Footnote 2: For

11 jail facilities in Indian country under 
a court order or consent decree on June 30,
2000

At midyear 2000, 11 facilities were under a
court order or consent decree to limit the
number of inmates they could house.  Five of
those facilities were under multiple court
orders or consent decrees, including to
detain persons in a humane condition, to
hold inmates for 48 hours only, and to
reduce overcrowding. 

Seventeen jails expected to increase
capacity by 1,108 beds before July 2003.  Four
jails planned to expand the existing facility,
12 had definite plans to build a new facility,
11 planned to renovate, and 3 planned to
close and build a new facility.

Methodology

"Indian country" is a statutory term that
includes the following:  all lands within an
Indian reservation; dependent Indian
communities; and Indian trust allotments
(18 U.S.C. sec. 1151).  Courts interpret section 
1151 to include all lands held in trust for tribes
or their members.  See United States v. Roberts.
185 F.3d 1125 (10th Cir. 1999).  Tribal authority
to imprison Indian offenders is limited to 1
year per offense by statute (25 U.S.C. sec.
1302).    

Tribal law enforcement agencies act as first
responders to both felony and misdemeanor
crimes.  For most of Indian country, the
Federal Government provides felony law
enforcement concerning crimes by or against
Indians.  Certain areas of Indian country are
under Public Law 83-280, as amended P.L. 280
conferred jurisdiction on certain States over
"Indian country" and suspended enforcement of 
the Major Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. section 1153) 
and the General Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. section 
1152) in those areas.  Indian tribes retain concurrent
jurisdiction to enforce laws in Indian country
where P.L. 280 applies.

BJS conducted the Survey of Jails in Indian
Country (SJIC) to describe all adult and
juvenile jail facilities and detention centers 
in Indian country.  For purposes of this report,
Indian country includes reservations,
pueblos, rancherias, and other appropriate
areas (18 U.S.C. section 1151). The reference 
date for the survey was June 30, 2000.  

The SJIC was initiated in 1998 as a
component of the Annual Survey of Jails
(ASJ).  The ASJ is conducted in each of the
4 to 5 years between the Census of Jails. 
The 2000 ASJ consisted of a sample survey
of 833 local jail jurisdictions, a survey of the
Nation's 44 multi-jurisdictional facilities, and
a survey of the 69 facilities in Indian country.
(For sampling information, see Prison and
Jails Inmates at Midyear 2000, BJS Bulletin,
March 2001, NCJ 185989.)

In 1998 the Office of Law Enforcement
Services, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), U.S.
Department of the Interior, provided a
complete list of 74 Indian country jail
facilities.  Since 1998, 2 facilities were
abandoned, 2 were closed, and 2 were
combined into 1 facility, resulting in 69
surveyed facilities.  The facilities are in 18
States and are affiliated with 54 Indian tribes.

Each facility is defined as a confinement
facility, which can include detention centers,
jails, and other correctional facilities,
operated by tribal authorities or the BIA. 
Special jail facilities such as medical,
treatment, or release centers; halfway
houses; and work farms are also included.  

Data were obtained by mailed questionnaires.  
Through follow-up phone calls and facsimiles, 
68 of 69 facilities responded.  Data for the 
Navajo Department of Corrections in Window 
Rock, Arizona, are from June 30, 1999.

The Bureau of Justice Statistics is
the statistical agency of the U.S.

BJS Bulletins present the first
release of findings from permanent
data collection programs.

Todd D. Minton collected and
processed the data and wrote this
report under the supervision of
Allen J. Beck.  Officials of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of
Law Enforcement Services --
William McClure, Detention
Program Manager, Ed Naranjo,
District V Commander, and Walter
E. Lamar, Acting Director --
assisted in obtaining cooperation
from facility administrators.  Norena
Henry, Director, American Indian and
Alaska Native Desk, Office of Justice
Programs, and Debra Gee, Deputy Director,
Office of Tribal Justice, U.S. Department
of Justice, reviewed the report.  Laura
M. Maruschak provided statistical
review and verification.  Tom Hester
edited the report, and Jayne
Robinson provided the final
production.
