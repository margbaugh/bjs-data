At yearend 1997, 2.1% of all State and Federal prison inmates
were known to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV).  The infection rate was down from 2.2% in 1996.  In 1997
a total of 23,548 prison inmates were HIV positive (1,030
Federal and 22,518 State).  HIV-positive inmates made up 1.0% of
Federal prison inmates and 2.2% of State prison inmates.  Of
those known to be HIV positive in all U.S. prisons, 6,184 were
confirmed AIDS cases, while the remaining 16,508 either showed
symptoms of HIV infection or were asymptomatic.

State prison inmates were HIV
positive, compared to 2.2% of male
State prisoners.

Based on jurisdictions with more than 
700 HIV-positive inmates.
 
*New York held about a third
of all inmates (7,500 inmates) known
to be HIV positive at yearend 1997.
 
*Of all HIV-positive prison inmates,
26% were confirmed AIDS cases.
In State prisons 26% of HIV-positive
inmates had AIDS; in Federal prisons, 
36%.
 
*The overall rate of confirmed AIDS
among the Nation's prison population
(0.55%) was more than 5 times the
rate in the U.S. population (0.10%).
 
*The number of AIDS-related deaths
among prison inmates decreased
from 907 in 1996 to 538 in 1997.
 
*Of all State prison inmates, 2.8% of
black inmates and 2.5% of Hispanic
inmates, compared to 1.4% of white
inmates reported to survey interview-

From the 1997 Survey of Inmates in State
Correctional Facilities.
 
In 1997 there were 538 AIDS-related deaths in State prisons,
down from 907 in 1996. For every 100,000 State prison inmates in
1997, 48 died of AIDS-related causes.  Between 1991 and 1996,
about 1 in 3 State prison inmate deaths were attributed to
AIDS-related causes; in 1997 about 1 in 5.

Data based on personal interviews from the 1997 Survey of
Inmates in State Correctional Facilities show that 75% of State
inmates were ever tested for HIV. Of those who were ever tested
and reported results, 2.2% were HIV positive -- 2.2% of males
and 3.4% of females.  As level of prior involvement in drug use
increased, so did the percentage of HIV-positive inmates: 2.3%
of those who said they had ever used drugs, 2.7% of those who
used drugs in the month before the current offense, 4.6% of
those who injected drugs, and 7.7% of those who ever shared a
needle were HIV positive.


Data based on official records and 
prisoner interviews

Departments of corrections in 50 States and the District of
Columbia as well as the Federal Bureau of Prisons provided data
on HIV/AIDS among inmates.  Since 1991 respondents have reported
their HIV-testing policies and the number of HIV- infected
inmates in their custody at yearend.  Those inmates are reported
to be asymptomatic, symptomatic, or with confirmed AIDS.  (See
questionnaire items in figure 1, page 10.)  Respondents have
also reported for each year the number of inmate deaths from
HIV-related infections and other causes.

Data on HIV/AIDS and demographics for prison inmates were
calculated from the 1997 Surveys of Inmates in State and Federal
Correctional Facilities.  Through personal interviews, inmates
held in prisons were questioned about current offenses, prior
drug use and treatment, personal characteristics and other
aspects of their life.  Questions on whether inmates had ever
been tested for HIV and the results of the test were included in
the interviews.


States report a small decrease 
in the number of HIV-infected
inmates during 1997


At yearend 1997, 23,548 inmates in State and Federal prisons
were known to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) (table 1).

--Not reported.
a/The custody population includes only those inmates housed in a 
jurisdiction's facilities.
b/Totals exclude those inmates in jurisdictions that did not report 
data on HIV/AID.
Counts may differ from previous reports.  Percentages for all years 
are based on yearend custody counts.
 
Although the number of reported HIV-positive imates was
down from the total reported at yearend 1996 (23,881), 
Virginia and Maine (with 383 and 4 cases, respectively, in 1996) 
did not report data in 1997.  The District of Columbia (with 75 
cases in 1997) had not reported data in 1996.  Based on comparable 
reporting jurisdictions in both years, the number of HIV- positive 
inmates decreased slightly in State prisons (down 104) and increased 
in Federal prisons (up 83). 

From 1991, when BJS began collecting data annually on HIV/AIDS,
to 1997, the number of inmates reported to be HIV positive
increased at about the same rate as the overall prison
population.  HIV-positive inmates comprised 2.2% of the State
prison population in 1997, down from 2.3% in 1991.  Infected
inmates were 1.0% of Federal prisoners in 1997, unchanged from
1991.

HIV-infected inmates were concentrated in a small number of
States.  New York and Florida housed the largest number of
HIV-positive inmates (7,500 and 2,325, respectively).  In 1997
these two States housed more than 40% of all HIV-infected
inmates in State prisons.

Northeast prisons held the largest 
number of HIV-infected inmates

Nearly half the State prison inmates known to be HIV positive
were in the Northeast. Within the Northeast, 6.4% of the prison
population were HIV positive, followed by 2.0% in the South,
0.9% in the Midwest, and 0.8% in the West.  New York had the
highest percentage of inmates known to be HIV positive (10.8%),
followed by Connecticut (5.1%) and Massachusetts (3.7%). 

Nine States (Alaska, Idaho, Kansas,  Montana, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming) reported 10 or 
fewer cases of HIV-positive inmates in their prisons.  Of the 46 
States that reported information in 1997, each reported having at 
least one HIV-positive inmates. Ten States reported that fewer 
than 0.5% of their inmate population were HIV positive.

Between 1996 and 1997, 15 States reported a decreased number of 
HIV-positive inmates.  The largest decrease (1,000 cases) was
reported in New York--7,500 in 1997, down from 8,500 in 1996. 
Michigan (down 109), Arizona (down 100), North Carolina (down
70), and Louisiana (down 66) also reported large decreases. 
Twenty-eight States reported an increased number of HIV cases. 
Texas reported the largest increase (up 250) during 1997,
followed by California (up 192) and Connecticut (up 108).


Confirmed AIDS cases in prison 
more than tripled from 1991 to 1997

At the end of 1997, 6,184 inmates had confirmed AIDS: 5,816 were

Note:  Care should be exercised when
comparing the number of reported
cases over time.  In January 1993 the
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention revised the HIV classifica-
tion system and expanded the surveil
lance case definition for AIDS to include
specific CD4+ T-lymphocyte criteria and
three additional clinical conditions--
pulmonary tuberculosis, recurrent
pneumonia, and invasive cervical
cancer.  This expansion resulted in a
substantial increase in the number of
reported AIDS cases during 1993.
 
 

During 1997 the number of confirmed AIDS cases increased by 337.
Overall, after 1991 the number of confirmed AIDS cases
increased 4,502 -- an annual average increase of 24.2%.  While the
number of confirmed AIDS cases increased, the number of inmates
with lesser or no symptoms of HIV infection decreased from
18,165 in 1995 to 16,503 in 1997.

The States with the largest number of confirmed AIDS cases were
New York (1,301), Texas (829), and Florida (826).  Combined,
these States made up 51% of all confirmed AIDS cases in State
prisons.  Seventeen States reported having fewer than 10
confirmed AIDS cases in their prison.

The highest percentage of the State prison population having
confirmed AIDS was in New York (1.9%), followed by  Rhode Island
(1.4%), Connecticut (1.3%),  Florida (1.3%), and Maryland
(1.3%).  In 17 States, confirmed AIDS cases comprised 0.1% or
less of State inmates.

population.  About 55 per 10,000 prison inmates had confirmed
AIDS, compared to 10 per 10,000 persons in the U.S. population.

Care should be exercised when
comparing percentages over time,
because of changes in the case

Methodology
 
In every year since 1991, the rate of confirmed AIDS has been
higher among prison inmates than in the general population.  In
1992 the rate of AIDS was 10 times higher for prisoners than the
general population.  In 1993, following a revision of the HIV
classification system and an expansion of the case definition
for AIDS, the rate of confirmed AIDS increased 1« times among
prisoners and doubled in the general population.  After the
adoption of these new measures, the incidence of AIDS grew
somewhat faster in the general population.

Following a decrease in 1996, the number of HIV-infected females
increased during 1997 (from 2,135 to 2,185).  The number of
infected male inmates decreased 7.6% (from 21,799 in 1996 to
20,153 in 1997).  Among State prisoners, the average annual
rates of increased from 1991 to 1997 of those infected with HIV
were 3.8% for males and 11.1% for females.

States in the Northeast reported the largest number of
HIV-positive male and female inmates (9,322 and 1,072,
respectively).  In seven States, more than 5% of all female
inmates were known to be HIV positive.  In New York (20.7%) and
Connecticut (13.1%) over 10% of female inmates were known to be
HIV-positive. New York (10.3%) was the only State in which more
than 10% of all male inmates were HIV-positive.  

New York also reported the largest number of male and female
HIV-positive inmates (6,755 and 745, respectively).  The second
largest numbers of HIV-positive male and female inmates were in
Florida (2,082 and 243, respectively), followed by Texas (1,887
and 239, respectively).  Seven States reported no female
HIV-positive inmates.  Every State reported at least one male
inmate as HIV positive. 


AIDS-related deaths in State 
prisons dropped 41% during 1997 

The number of State inmates who died of Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia, Kaposis's sarcoma, or other AIDS-related diseases
decreased from 907 in 1996 to 538 in 1997 (table 4).

Note: To calculate the rate  of death, the number of inmates under 
State jurisdiction on June 30 of each year was used as an approximation 
of the average population exposed to the risk of death during the year.
 

These AIDS deaths accounted for 19% of all deaths among State 
prisoners, down from 29% in 1996.  Even with a sharp decline, 
AIDS-related illnesses were still the second leading cause of 
death in State prisons behind natural causes other than AIDS.   

In 1997 for every 100,000 inmates, 48 died from AIDS-related
causes (table 5).

--Not reported.
**Not calculated for 10 or fewer deaths.
a/Based on the number of inmates under State jurisdiction 
on June 30, 1997, with a sentence of more than 1 year.
b/National and regional totals exclude inmates in jurisdictions that did 
not report data on cause of death.
 
Between 1995 and 1997, the number of AIDS-related deaths in State 
prisons decreased 47%.  This decrease may reflect improvement in 
the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS care, following the introduction of 
protease inhibitors and combination antiretroviral therapies.


AIDS death rate in State prison
at least 3 times the rate in the
general population

In 1997 the rate of death because of AIDS was over 3 times
higher in the prison population than in the total U.S.
population age 15-54.  About 1 in every 5 prisoner deaths were
attributable to AIDS-related causes.  In 1996 about 1 in 10
deaths in the general population were AIDS related.

 AIDS-related deaths accounted for more than a third of all
inmate deaths in Florida (45%), New Jersey (41%), Connecticut
(39%), and South Carolina (35%) (table 5).  Prison officials in
the South reported the most AIDS-related deaths (309); Florida
accounted for 108 of those deaths.  Nineteen States reported
having no AIDS-related deaths, and 7 States reported 1 AIDS-
related death.  


Eighteen States tested all inmates 
for HIV either at admission or  
while in prison 

Prison officials report data on HIV and AIDS in the National
Prisoners Statistics series (NPS-1).  The quality of the
reporting may vary by the nature and extent of testing in each
jurisdiction. Testing policies range from testing all inmates to
testing only upon inmate request.   

In 1997 all States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal
Bureau of Prisons tested their inmates for HIV based on certain
criteria (table 6).

*The Bureau of Prisons tests a random sample of inmates on alternate years.

 
Most jurisdictions (44 out of 52) tested inmates if they had HIV-
related symptoms or if the inmates requested a test.  Twenty-nine 
States tested inmates after they were involved in an incident, and 
15 States tested inmates who belonged to specific "high-risk groups."

Of the 18 States that tested all entering inmates, 4 States
(Alabama, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia) and the Federal Bureau
of Prisons tested inmates at release. 

Arkansas, Rhode Island, and Virginia tested all inmates
currently in custody. New York was the only State that tested
inmates selected at random.

HIV/AIDS reported in personal 
interviews

Data based on reports from correctional authorities are limited
in detail and may understate the number of inmates infected with
HIV.  Additional information may be obtained through personal
interviews of prisoners.  Though some inmates may be reluctant
to report that they are HIV positive and others may not know,
surveys provide a means to track HIV infection among demographic
and "high-risk" groups not identified in official records.

The 1997 Surveys of State and Federal Correctional Facilities
asked inmates if they had ever been tested, if they had been
tested since admission, and whether they were HIV positive.

Black non-Hispanic inmates (2.8%) were twice as likely as white 
non-Hispanic inmates (1.4%) to report being HIV positive.  Among 
male inmates, black non-Hispanics (2.7%) were nearly twice as 
likely as white non-Hispanics (1.4%) to be HIV positive.  Because 
of the small number of inmates interviewed, the rates of HIV 
infection among female inmates were not significantly different 
between white non-Hispanics (2.3%), black non- Hispanics (3.9%), 
and Hispanics (4.2%).

In Federal prisons 0.6% of males and of females reported an HIV
infection.  HIV-positive rates were lowest for white
non-Hispanic inmates (0.3%).  In both State and Federal prisons, 
inmates age 17-24 had the lowest rates  (0.5% and 0.1%, respectively).  
In State prisons, inmates age 35-44 had the highest HIV-positive 
rate (3.1%). Those inmates age 25 or older were more likely to be HIV
positive than those who were 24 or younger.  In Federal prisons,
inmates age 45 or older had the highest rate of HIV infection
(1.2%).


Among State prisoners drug 
offenders reported a higher 
prevalence of HIV infection

Those inmates held on a drug offense in State prisons had the
highest HIV- positive rate (2.9% ) (table 9).

Of property offenders, 2.4% reported being HIV positive.  Rates 
were slightly lower for violent and public-order offenders (1.9%
each).  Of Federal prison inmates, 1.0% of violent offenders,
property offenders, and public-order offenders reported being
HIV positive.

The percentage of State and Federal prison inmates reporting
that they were HIV positive varied by level of prior drug use. 
Of State prison inmates who reported never using drugs, 1.7%
were HIV positive.  An estimated 2.3% of inmates who had ever
used drugs, 2.7% of those who used drugs in the month before
their current offense, 4.6% of those who had used a needle to
inject drugs, and 7.7% of those who had shared a needle reported
being HIV positive.  Like State inmates, Federal inmates who
used a needle and shared a needle had a higher rate of HIV
infection than those inmates who reported ever using drugs or
using drugs in the month before their current offense (1.3% and
2.1% compared to 0.7% and 0.3%). 


Methodology

Data are based on yearly reports from prison officials in the
departments of corrections of the 50 States and the District of
Columbia and in the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  The National
Prisoner Statistics series (NPS-1) includes an annual yearend
count of prisoners by jurisdiction, gender, race, Hispanic
origin, and admissions and releases during the year.

Since 1991 respondents have been asked to indicate their
policies for testing for HIV and to provide the number of
HIV-infected inmates in their custody on the last day of the
calendar year.

To obtain more detailed information on inmates, this report also
used data from the 1997 Surveys of Inmates in State and Federal
Correctional Facilities.  Detailed descriptions of the
methodology and sample design of each survey can be found in the
following:  Substance Abuse and Treatment of State and Federal
Prisoners, 1997 (NCJ 172871). 


Accuracy of the survey estimates

The accuracy of the estimates from the 1997 Surveys of Inmates
in State and Federal Correctional Facilities depends on two
types of error:  sampling and nonsampling.  Sampling error is
variation that may occur by chance because a sample rather than
a complete enumeration of the population was conducted. 
Nonsampling error can be attributed to many sources, such as
nonresponse, differences in the interpretation of questions
among inmates, recall difficulties, and processing errors.  
In any survey the full extent of the nonsampling error is never
known.

The sampling error, as measured by an estimated standard error,
varies by the size of the estimate and the size of the base
population.  Estimates for the percentage of inmates ever tested
for HIV and the percentage who tested HIV positive have been
calculated (see appendix table).

These standard errors may be used to construct confidence intervals 
around percentages.  For example, the 95-percent confidence interval 
around the percentage of males in State prisons who were HIV positive 
is approximately 2.2% plus or minus 1.96 times 0.20 (or 1.8% to
2.6%).

These standard errors may also be used to test the statistical
significance of the difference between two sample estimates by
pooling the standard errors of the estimates (that is, by taking
the square root of the sum of the squared standard errors for
each sample estimate).  All comparisons discussed in this report
were statistically significant at the 95-percent confidence level.

AIDS in the U.S. resident population

The number of persons with confirmed AIDS in the U.S. general 
population (age 13 and over) was derived from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, 
yearend editions 1991-97. For each year the number of active AIDS 
cases in the United States was calculated by subtracting the number 
of cumulative AIDS deaths for people age 15 or older at yearend from 
the cumulative number of total AIDS cases for people age 13 or older
at yearend as listed in the HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report.

The data for the U.S. general population, excluding persons
under age 13 from 1991 to 1997 were taken from the U.S.
Population Estimates, by Age, Sex, Race, and Hispanic Origin:
1990 to 1995, PPL-41, and update for 1996 and 1997).

The rate of confirmed AIDS cases in the U.S. resident population
was calculated by dividing the annual totals for individuals
with AIDS by the population estimates for the U.S. resident
population of individuals 13 and older.  The classification system 
for HIV infection and the case definition for AIDS were expanded 
in 1993.  This expansion improved estimates of the number and the 
characteristics of persons with HIV disease, but complicated 
interpretation of AIDS trends.  The increase in reported AIDS cases 
in 1993 was largely the consequence of the added surveillance criteria.  
(See CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, Vol. 43, No. 45, 
November 18,1994.)


AIDS-related deaths in the United 
States

The number of AIDS-related deaths for persons age 15-54 was
derived from the CDC, HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, yearend
editions.  Deaths in the U.S. population for persons age 15-54
were taken from the CDC, Monthly Vital Statistics Report, Vol.
42, No. 2(S); Vol. 43, No. 12; Vol. 43, No. 6(S); Vol. 45, No.
3(S);  and Vol. 45, No. 11(S); and from the CDC, National Vital
Statistics Report, Vol. 47, No. 9, and Vol. 47, No. 25.

AIDS-related deaths as a percentage of all deaths in the U.S.
population were calculated by dividing the national estimate of
AIDS deaths of  persons age 15-54 by the national mortality
estimates of persons age 15-54 in a given year.
