In September 2008, state and local law enforcement agencies
employed more than 1.1 million persons on a full-time basis,
including about 765,000 sworn personnel (defined as those
with general arrest powers). Agencies also employed
approximately 100,000 part-time employees, including 44,000
sworn officers. These findings come from the 2008 Bureau of
Justice Statistics' (BJS) Census of State and Local Law
Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA), the fifth such census to be
conducted since the quadrennial series began in 1992. 

From 2004 to 2008, state and local agencies added a net total
of about 33,000 full-time sworn personnel. This was about
9,500 more than agencies added from 2000 to 2004 (figure 1),
reversing a trend of declining growth observed in prior
4-year comparisons based on the CSLLEA. Local police
departments added the most officers, about 14,000. Sheriffs'
offices and special jurisdiction agencies added about 8,000
officers each. From 2004 to 2008, the number of full-time
sworn personnel per 100,000 U.S. residents increased from 250
to 251. 
--------------------------------------------------------
HIGHLIGHTS 

*State and local law enforcement agencies employed about
1,133,000 persons on a full-time basis in 2008, including
765,000 sworn personnel. 

*Local police departments were the largest employer of sworn
personnel, accounting for 60% of the total. Sheriffs' offices
were next, accounting for 24%. 

*About half (49%) of all agencies employed fewer than 10
full-time officers. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of sworn
personnel worked for agencies that employed 100 or more
officers. 

*From 2004 to 2008, overall full-time employment by state and
local law enforcement agencies nationwide increased by about
57,000 (or 5.3%). Sworn personnel increased by about 33,000
(4.6%), and nonsworn employees by about 24,000 (6.9%). 

*From 2004 to 2008, state and local law enforcement agencies
added about 9,500 more full-time sworn personnel than during
the previous 4-year period. 

*The number of full-time sworn personnel per 100,000
residents increased from 250 in 2004 to 251 in 2008. 
*Fifteen of the 50 largest local police departments employed
fewer full-time sworn personnel in 2008 than in 2004. The
largest declines were in Detroit (36%), Memphis (23%), New
Orleans (13%), and San Francisco (10%). 

*Ten of the 50 largest local police departments reported
double-digit increases in sworn personnel from 2004 to 2008.
The largest increases were in Phoenix (19%), Prince George's
County (Maryland) (17%), Dallas (15%), and Fort Worth (14%).

State and local law enforcement agencies 

The 2008 CSLLEA included 17,985 state and local law
enforcement agencies employing at least one full-time officer
or the equivalent in part-time officers. The total included-- 

*12,501 local police departments 

*3,063 sheriffs' offices 

*50 primary state law enforcement agencies 

*1,733 special jurisdiction agencies 

*638 other agencies, primarily county constable offices in
Texas.
 
A majority of state and local law enforcement personnel
worked for local police departments 

Local police departments were the largest employer of
full-time state and local law enforcement personnel with
about 593,000 (or 52%) of the more than 1.1 million employees
nationwide (table 1 and appendix table 1). Sheriffs' offices
employed about 353,000 (31%). Both the 50 primary state law
enforcement agencies and the special jurisdiction agencies
(those that served a special geographic jurisdiction or had
special enforcement or investigative responsibilities)
accounted for 8% . (See table 7 for types of special
jurisdiction agencies.) 

About 461,000 sworn state and local law enforcement employees
(60%) were local police officers. Sworn personnel in
sheriffs' offices accounted for about 183,000 (24%). The 50
primary state law enforcement agencies employed about
61,000 (8%), and special jurisdiction agencies employed about
57,000 (7%).

Sheriffs' offices accounted for 46%of the 369,000 full-time
civilian personnel nationwide, and local police departments
accounted for 36%. Nearly half (48%) of the full-time
employees in sheriffs' offices were civilians, compared
to 35% in state law enforcement agencies and 22% in local
police departments (not shown in table).

The largest 7% of state and local law enforcement agencies
employed 64% of all sworn personnel 

Nearly 1,200 state and local law enforcement agencies (7%)
employed 100 or more full-time sworn personnel, with 83 of
those agencies employing 1,000 or more officers (table 2 and
appendix table 2). The agencies with 1,000 or more officers
included 49 local police departments, 20 state law
enforcement agencies, 13 sheriffs' offices, and 1 special
jurisdiction agency. 

Agencies with 100 or more officers employed 64% of all
full-time sworn personnel, and those with 1,000 or more
officers employed 29%. (See appendix table 5 for the 50
largest state and local law enforcement agencies.) 

About 8,800 state and local law enforcement agencies (49% of
the total) employed fewer than 10 full-time sworn personnel,
and about 5,400 (30%) employed fewer than 5 officers. Among
these smaller agencies, about 2,100 (12%) had just one
full-time officer or had part-time officers only. 
 
Agencies with fewer than 10 full-time sworn personnel
employed less than 5% of all full-time officers, but 50% of
all part-time officers. Those employing 1,000 or more
full-time sworn personnel  accounted for less than 1% of all
part-time officers nationwide (not shown in table). 

From 1992 to 2008, the growth rate for civilian personnel was
more than double that of sworn personnel 

From 2004 to 2008, the total number of full-time state and
local law enforcement employees increased by about 57,000
(5.3%). This total included an increase in sworn personnel of
about 33,000 (4.6%). Civilian employment in the agencies rose
by 24,000 (6.9%). Local police departments accounted for a
larger proportion of the growth in sworn officers from 2004
to 2008 than other agency types, and sheriffs' offices
accounted for most of the growth in civilian employees. 

Reversing a pattern of declining growth observed in the 2000
and 2004 CSLLEA data collections, about 9,500 more full-time
sworn personnel were added from 2004 to 2008 than in the
previous 4-year period. The percentage growth in the number
of sworn officers from 2004 to 2008 (4.6%) exceeded growth
from 2000 to 2004 (3.4%), but was about half the 9.1% peak
growth rate recorded from 1992 to 1996. 

From 2004 to 2008, the growth rate for sworn personnel in
sheriffs' offices (4.5%) was about the same as the overall
rate. The growth rates for local police departments (3.2%)
and the primary state law enforcement agencies (3.4%) were
lower than the overall average. The growth rate was highest
among special jurisdiction agencies (16.7%). 

From 1992 (the year of the first CSLLEA) to 2008, state and
local law enforcement agencies added more than 287,000
full-time employees (a 34% increase), including about 157,000
sworn officers (26%) and 130,000 civilian employees (55%)
(figure 2). 

Nationwide there was 1 sworn officer for every 400 residents 

In 2008 there were 373 full-time state and local law
enforcement employees per 100,000 residents nationwide,
compared to 367 per 100,000 in 2004 and 332 per 100,000 in
1992 (figure 3). There were 251 sworn personnel per 100,000
residents nationwide in 2008, or about 1 officer for every
400 residents. This was a slight increase over the 2004 ratio
of 250 per 100,000 residents. 

There were more than 300 full-time sworn personnel per
100,000 residents in the District of Columbia (722),
Louisiana (405), New Jersey (389), New York (341), Illinois
(321), and Wyoming (317) (figure 4). In contrast, there were
fewer than 200 full-time sworn personnel per 100,000
residents in Washington (174), Utah (175), Oregon (177),
Vermont (178), Kentucky (183), Minnesota (185), West Virginia
(186), Alaska (189), Michigan (190), Iowa (195), and Maine
(195). (See appendix table 6 for state-by-state agency and
employee counts.) 

Local police departments
 
In 2008, 12,501 local police departments in the United States
employed at least one full-time officer or the equivalent in
part-time officers. Nearly all (98%) were operated by a
municipal government. The remainder were operated by a
county, tribal, or consolidated city-county government or
served multiple jurisdictions under a regional or joint
arrangement. Overall, about a third (35%) of the nearly
36,000 sub-county (municipal, township) general purpose local
governments nationwide operated a local police department. 
 
States with the largest numbers of local police departments
were Pennsylvania (965), Texas (788), Illinois (701), Ohio
(678), New Jersey (476), Michigan (455), Missouri (430), and
Wisconsin (429). States with the fewest were Hawaii (4),
Delaware (36), Nevada (38), Rhode Island (39), and Alaska
(42). (See appendix table 7 for state-by-state agency and
employee counts.) 

Although most local police departments were small, most local
police officers worked for larger agencies 

More than half of local police departments employed fewer
than 10 full-time officers, and the overall median size was 8
full-time officers (table 3). Although departments with fewer
than 10 full-time officers comprised 53% of all agencies,
they employed just 6% of all officers (appendix table 3). A
total of 638 (5%) of local police departments employed 100 or
more full-time sworn personnel. These agencies employed 61%
of all local police officers. 

About 14,000 local police officers were added nationwide from
2004 to 2008, compared to about 6,000 in the previous 4-year
period 

From 2004 to 2008, the total number of full-time local police
employees increased by 20,000 (3.5%) to about 593,000 (figure
5). The number of full-time sworn personnel increased by
14,000 (3.2%) to about 461,000 during this period. The number
of civilian employees rose by 6,000 (4.6%) to about 132,000. 

From 2004 to 2008, the number of local police officers fell
by 36% in Detroit and by 23% in Memphis 

During 2008 the New York City Police Department (NYPD), with
36,023 full-time officers, remained the largest local police
department in the United States (appendix table 8). The NYPD
employed nearly 3 times as many sworn personnel as the next
largest agency  the Chicago Police Department (13,354
officers). The other three local police departments that
employed 5,000 or more officers during 2008 were in Los
Angeles (9,727 officers), Philadelphia (6,624), and Houston
(5,053). 

From 2004 to 2008, 15 of the 50 largest local police
departments experienced a decrease in number of officers
employed, compared to 20 of 50 between 2000 and 2004. The
decline was small for some departments, such as the NYPD,
which had 95 (0.3%) fewer officers in 2008 than 2004. In
other departments, the loss was more substantial. Four of the
50 largest departments experienced a drop of more than 10% in
the number of full-time officers from 2004 to 2008: 

*Detroit Police (down 35.9%) 

*Memphis Police (down 23.2%) 

*New Orleans Police (down 13.4%) 

*San Francisco Police (down 10.5%). 

Ten local police departments had a double-digit percentage
increase in number of officers from 2004 to 2008 

Among the 50 largest local police departments, 35 employed
more full-time officers in 2008 than in 2004. The departments
serving the following jurisdictions reported a double-digit
increase: 

*Phoenix, Arizona (up 18.5%) 

*Prince George's County, Maryland (up 17.4%)
 
*Dallas, Texas (up 15.5%) 

*Montgomery County, Maryland (up 15.2%) 

*Fort Worth, Texas (up 14.0%)

*DeKalb County, Georgia (up 13.1%) 

*Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, North Carolina (up 12.7%)

*Austin, Texas (up 11.2%) . Boston, Massachusetts (up 11.2%)
 
*Las Vegas-Clark County, Nevada (up 10.0%). 

About half of the 50 largest departments had fewer officers
per 100,000 residents in 2008 than 2004 

In 2008, the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police continued
to have the highest ratio of full-time officers (634 officers
per 100,000 residents), but this was an 3% decrease from
2004. Despite a 13% reduction in officers since 2004, the New
Orleans Police had the seventh highest ratio of officers to
residents at 423 per 100,000. This ratio was 19% higher than
in 2004 as the city's population (although growing since
2007) remained well below the levels that existed prior to
Hurricane Katrina in August 2005. 

Other large local police departments with more than 400
officers per 100,000 residents during 2008 included those in
Chicago (472), Newark (472), Baltimore (469), Philadelphia
(430), and New York (432). The lowest ratios among the 50
largest departments were in Montgomery County (Maryland)
(129), Fairfax County (Virginia) (144), San Jose (146), San
Antonio (150), and DeKalb County (Georgia) (168). Overall, 24
of the 50 largest local police departments had fewer officers
per 100,000 residents in 2008 than in 2004. 

Sheriffs' offices 

The office of sheriff exists in nearly every county and
independent city in the United States with a total of 3,085
offices nationwide. A total of 3,063 sheriffs' offices
employed at least one full-time sworn officer or the
equivalent in part-time officers during 2008. (Note: Some
sheriffs' offices that have been involved in consolidations
of county and municipal governmental functions are classified
as local police in the CSLLEA.) States with the most
sheriffs' offices were Texas (254), Georgia (159), Kentucky
(120), Missouri (114), Kansas (104), Illinois (102), and
North Carolina (100). (See appendix table 9 for
state-by-state agency and employee counts). 

Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, and Rhode Island do not have any
local sheriffs' offices. In those four states the court
related duties typically performed by local sheriffs' offices
are the responsibility of state agencies. The District of
Columbia also does not have a sheriffs' office, where such
duties are performed by the U.S. Marshals Service.  
Nearly all sheriffs' offices performed law enforcement and
court-related functions; about 3 in 4 operated at least one
jail 

Nearly all (96%) sheriffs' offices performed traditional law
enforcement functions such as providing patrol services,
responding to citizen calls for service, and enforcing
traffic laws. A similar percentage performed court-related
duties such as serving process (98%) and providing court
security (96%). In addition, 75% of sheriffs' offices were
responsible for operating at least one jail. 

Nationwide, sheriffs' offices had the equivalent of 59% of
their full-time sworn personnel assigned to law enforcement
operations, 23% to jail operations, 12% to court operations,
and 6% to other duty areas. (Note: The CSLLEA counts all
personnel with general arrest powers as sworn officers
regardless of duty area.) 

Nearly 400 sheriffs' offices employed 100 or more full-time
sworn personnel 

In 2008, 13 sheriffs' offices employed 1,000 or more
full-time sworn officers, accounting for 18% of the full-time
sworn personnel employed by sheriffs' offices nationwide
(table 4 and appendix table 4). A total of 378 (12%)
sheriffs' offices employed at least 100 officers, ac-counting
for 66% of sworn personnel. 

While more than half of local police departments employed
fewer than 10 full-time officers in 2008, less than a third
(29%) of sheriffs' offices were this small. The median
staffing level of sheriffs' offices was 18 full-time sworn
personnel. 

Sheriffs' offices added more than twice as many civilian
employees as sworn ones from 2004 to 2008 

From 2004 to 2008, total full-time staff in sheriffs' offices
increased by 27,000 employees (8.2%) to about 353,000 (figure
6). The number of full-time sworn personnel increased by
8,000 (4.5%) to about 183,000 during this period. The number
of civilian employees rose by 19,000 (12.5%) to about
170,000. 

The Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department was the largest
in the United States, employing 9,461 full-time sworn
personnel (appendix table 10). About a third of these
officers had regularly assigned duties that included
responding to citizen calls for service, with the remainder
assigned to court and jail-related duties. The second largest
sheriff 's office served Cook County, Illinois, with 5,655
sworn personnel. Just 4% of these officers were assigned to
respond to calls. 

Among the 50 largest sheriffs' offices, the percent of sworn
personnel assigned to respond to calls for service ranged
from 0% to 97%. All but one agency reported having at least
some sworn personnel who regularly performed law enforcement
duties, and all but four had sworn personnel who performed
court-related functions. About two-thirds of the agencies
employed sworn personnel who performed jail-related duties.
 
Primary state law enforcement agencies 

The CSLLEA identifies a primary state law enforcement agency
in each of the 50 states. Depending on the state, this agency
may be a state police agency, highway patrol agency, or a
department of public safety. The latter are often more
complex organizations and may encompass several agencies or
divisions. Comparisons between primary state law enforcement
agencies may not always be appropriate because of differences
in organizational structure and responsibilities. 

From 2004 to 2008, employment by primary state law
enforcement agencies rose by about 4% 

In 2008, the 50 primary state law enforcement agencies had
93,148 full-time employees, including about 61,000 full-time
sworn personnel (table 5). Twenty agencies employed 1,000 or
more sworn personnel, and 35 agencies employed at least 500
full-time officers. 

State agencies had 3,240 (3.6%) more employees in 2008 than
in 2004. (figure 7) Employment of full-time sworn personnel 

The California Highway Patrol was the largest state law
enforcement agency 

The largest state law enforcement agency, the California
Highway Patrol, had 7,202 full-time sworn personnel, followed
by the New York State Po-lice (4,847), Pennsylvania State
Police (4,458), Texas Department of Public Safety (3,529),
and New Jersey State Police (3,053) (table 6). 

Five agencies had fewer than 250 full-time sworn personnel:
the North Dakota Highway Patrol (139), South Dakota Highway
Patrol (152), Rhode Island State Police (201), Wyoming
Highway Patrol (204), and Montana Highway Patrol (218). 

The Delaware State Police (75) had the largest number of
full-time officers per 100,000 residents, followed by the
Vermont State Police (49) and the Alaska State Troopers (40).
The Wisconsin State Patrol (9), Florida Highway Patrol (9),
and Minnesota State Patrol (10) had the smallest numbers of
full-time officers per 100,000 residents. 

From 2004 to 2008, 30 of the 50 primary state law enforcement
agencies increased the number of full-time sworn personnel
they employed. Three agencies increased their number of
full-time sworn personnel by more than 20%: the South
Carolina Highway Patrol (up 23.2%), the New Hampshire State
Police (up 21.1%), and the North Carolina State Highway
Patrol (up 20.4%). The largest decreases in the number of
full-time sworn personnel were reported by the Utah
Department of Public Safety (down 11.7%), the Maryland State
Police (down 9.8%), and the Idaho State Police (down 8.3%).
 
The ratio of full-time sworn personnel per 100,000 residents
served increased in 23 agencies from 2004 to 2008. The
largest increases of officers per 100,000 residents were
reported by the New Hampshire State Police (up 18.4%), the
Iowa Department of Public Safety (up 17.6%), and the
Louisiana State Police (up 15.3%). The largest decreases were
reported by the Utah Department of Public Safety (down
21.0%), the Idaho State Police (down 16.5%), and the
Georgia Department of Public Safety (down 13.2%).

Special jurisdiction law enforcement agencies 

More than 1,700 state and local law enforcement agencies
served a special geographic jurisdiction, or had special
enforcement or investigative responsibilities during 2008.
These agencies employed about 90,000 persons full time,
including 57,000 sworn personnel (table 7). 

About 11,000 full-time sworn personnel were employed at
4-year public universities and colleges 

More than two-thirds of special jurisdiction law enforcement
agencies served public buildings and facilities, employing
more than 21,000 sworn personnel. Within this group were more
than 500 campus police departments serving 4-year public
institutions. These agencies employed about 11,000 full-time
sworn officers. Another 253 campus police agencies served
2-year public colleges, employing more than 2,600 full-time
sworn personnel. Addition-ally, 18 agencies, employing more
than 700 full-time officers, served medical campuses. 

The largest campus law enforcement agency serving a public
institution of higher education was the Temple University
Police Department in Philadelphia, which employed 125
full-time sworn personnel (table 8). The next largest were at
the University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey (94
full-time officers), the University of Texas Health Science
Center in Houston (94), the University of Maryland-College
Park (90), and the University of Florida (85). (For more
information on campus law enforcement agencies including
those serving private campuses and those not employing sworn
personnel, see Campus Law Enforcement Agencies, 2004-05, BJS
Web, February 2008.) 

A total of 250 special jurisdiction agencies served public
school districts 

The 250 police departments operated by public school
districts nationwide employed nearly 5,000 full-time sworn
personnel. Although some large school systems, including
those in New York and Chicago, obtained services from their
city police departments, some of the largest systems had
their own police departments with full-time sworn personnel.
The largest of these in 2008 was the School District of
Philadelphia which employed 450 full-time sworn officers
(table 9). Other large school police departments included
those serving districts in Los Angeles (340 full-time
officers); Miami-Dade County, Florida (210); Houston, Texas
(197); Palm Beach County, Florida (176); Clark County, Nevada
(157); and Baltimore, Maryland (142). 

Another 29 special jurisdiction agencies, employing more than
1,100 officers, were responsible for providing services for
state government buildings. Many of these agencies use the
name capitol police, reflecting the most prominent of the
facilities they protect. In some states, police protection
for the capitol and other state government buildings falls
under the jurisdiction of a primary state law enforcement
agency, such as the state police. 

Nearly 15,000 full-time sworn personnel were employed in jobs
related to natural resources 

After agencies serving public buildings and facilities, the
next largest employer of full-time sworn personnel among
special jurisdiction agencies was the group responsible for
enforcing laws pertaining to natural resources. Most of these
agencies enforced laws pertaining to fish and wildlife
conservation, or pro-vided law enforcement services for parks
and recreation areas. Other functions included enforcing
environmental pollution laws, boating laws, and protecting
vital forest and water resources. Overall, these 246 agencies
employed nearly 15,000 full-time sworn personnel. 
 
Many of the largest natural resources law enforcement
agencies were operated at the state level, including 28 of
the 30 largest (table 10). The California Department of Parks
and Recreation employed the most full-time sworn personnel
(645), followed by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation
Com-mission (626), Texas Parks & Wildlife Department (480),
Ohio Department of Natural Resources (394), and California
Department of Fish & Game (330). 

The largest local-level agency in this category was operated
by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection,
which employed 168 full-time police officers to protect the
city's watershed and water infrastructure.  Many park police
agencies also existed at the local and regional levels, and
21 Native American tribes employed separate agencies with
full-time sworn personnel to enforce laws pertaining to fish
and wildlife conservation. 

Agencies tasked with safeguarding transportation systems and
facilities 

Transportation-related jurisdictions, such as mass transit
systems, airports, bridges, tunnels, commercial vehicles, and
port facilities, have been a major area of focus for homeland
security efforts in recent years. In 2008, 167 law
enforcement agencies had specific transportation-related
jurisdictions and employed about 11,500 full-time sworn
officers. The largest, the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey Police Department, employed 1,667 officers in 2008
(table 11). The multiple jurisdictions of the Port Authority
Police included LaGuardia, Kennedy, and Newark Airports, the
Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, the George Washington and Staten
Island Bridges, the PATH train system, the Port Authority Bus
Terminal, and the Port Newark and Port Elizabeth Marine
Terminals. 

After the Port Authority Police, the five largest
transportation-related police forces were employed by the New
York State Metropolitan Transportation Authority (694
officers), Los Angeles World Airports (577), Maryland
Transportation Authority (456), Washington, D.C. Metropolitan
Area Transit Authority (442), and Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid
Transit Authority (MARTA) (309). 

Law enforcement services for some large airport and transit
systems are provided by a local police department or sheriff
's office. For example, the police departments in New York
City and Chicago are responsible for the subway systems in
those cities. In addition, the Chicago Police also provide
law enforcement services for O'Hare and Midway airports,
working in conjunction with the 251 unarmed sworn officers of
the Chicago Department of Aviation. 

Methodology 

The Bureau of Justice Statistics' (BJS) Census of State and
Local Law Enforcement Agencies (CSLLEA) is conducted every 4
years to provide a complete enumeration of agencies and their
employees. Employment data are reported by agencies for sworn
and nonsworn (civilian) personnel and, within these
categories, by full-time or part-time status. 

Agencies also complete a checklist of functions they
regularly perform, or have primary responsibility for, within
the following areas: patrol and response, criminal
investigation, traffic and vehicle-related functions,
detention-related functions, court-related functions, special
public safety functions (e.g., animal control), task force
participation, and specialized functions (e.g., search and
rescue). 

The CSLLEA provides national data on the number of state and
local law enforcement agencies and employees for local police
departments, sheriffs' offices, state law enforcement
agencies, and special jurisdiction agencies. It also serves
as the sampling frame for BJS surveys of law enforcement
agencies. 

The 2008 CSLLEA form was mailed to 20,110 agencies that were
determined to potentially be operating on the reference date
of September 30, 2008. This master list was created by
compiling information from the following sources: 

*The 2004 CSLLEA 

*Lists provided by Peace Officer Standards and Training
offices and other state agencies 

*An FBI list of agencies requesting new identifiers since the
2004 CSLLEA 

Data were collected on behalf of BJS by the National Opinion
Research Center (NORC) at the University of Chicago. More
than half (52%) of all responses were submitted in hardcopy
version by mail or fax. Another 41% were received through a
secure website operated by NARC.  The remaining 7% of
agencies did not respond by website, mail, or fax within the
allotted timeframe and were contacted by phone with BJS's
assistance. The information necessary to determine
eligibility was obtained from all agencies. 

Responding agencies were screened for eligibility and were
excluded if any of the following conditions existed on the
CSLLEA reference date of September 30, 2008. The percentage
of agencies from the original master list that were ruled
ineligible through each criterion is in parentheses. 

*The agency employed only part-time officers, and their total
combined works hours averaged less than 35 hours per week
(5.1% of agencies from master list excluded). 

*The agency was closed, represented a duplicate listing, or
was otherwise an invalid entry (2.2% excluded). 

*The agency contracted or outsourced to another agency for
performance of all services (1.7% excluded). 

*The agency did not employ personnel with general arrest
powers (0.6% excluded). 

*The agency did not operate with funds from a state, local,
special district, or tribal government (0.6% excluded). 

*All sworn officers volunteered their time on an unpaid basis
(0.3% excluded). 

Data on number and type of personnel were obtained from all
eligible agencies. Data on agency functions were obtained
from 99.0% and on primary duty area of sworn personnel from
99.4% of eligible agencies. 

The ratios of personnel per 100,000 residents were calculated
using final population estimates published by the Census
Bureau for July 1st of each CSLLEA year. The ratios for
county-level agencies in appendix table 8 exclude the
population of municipalities within the counties that were
operating their own police departments. 

The counts generated by the CSLLEA are more inclusive than
those of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. The
CSLLEA includes all officers with arrest powers regardless of
function, while the UCR data exclude officers not paid out of
police funds. This exclusion generally pertains to officers
working exclusively for jails or courts.
 
Another reason the UCR counts are lower than those from the
CSLLEA is that the UCR excludes some agencies that do not
have an Originating Agency Identifier (ORI) assigned by the
FBI. Some agencies without an ORI are still included in the
UCR employee counts (but not in the agency counts) because
they report their data to another agency, which reports it to
the FBI. Overall, the UCR data cover about 95% of the U.S.
population, while the CSLLEA covers 100%. In addition to
greater population coverage, the CSLLEA has counted about 8%
more sworn personnel than the UCR in 2000, 2004, and 2008
(table 12). Over time, the employment growth trends recorded
by the CSLLEA have been consistent with those recorded by the
UCR.
