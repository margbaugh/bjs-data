Immigration and Naturalization Service (12,403), the Bureau of
Prisons (11,329), the FBI (10,389), and the Customs Service
(9,749).  Twelve other agencies employed at  least 500 officers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------


As of June 1996 Federal agencies employed about 74,500 full-time
personnel authorized to make arrests and carry firearms,
according to agency responses to a Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS) survey.  In a comparison of 1996 data with those reported
by the same agencies for December 1993, employment of such
personnel was up about 6%.

As in 1993 the BJS officer count in 1996 includes all personnel
with Federal arrest authority who were also authorized (but not
necessarily  required) to carry firearms in the performance of
their official duties.  Supervisory personnel are included.  

The totals exclude Federal officers serving in foreign countries
or U.S. territories as well as those employed by the U.S. Coast
Guard and the U.S. Armed Forces.  They do include Federal
correctional officers.



Both the 1993 and 1996 surveys collected data on the primary job
function of officers and their primary State of employment.  The
1996 survey also collected data on the race and sex of Federal
officers.

Job function of Federal officers
-------------------------------------------

In response to the BJS survey, Federal agencies categorized
their personnel with arrest and firearms authority into one of
six categories according to their primary area of duty.  The
largest number, about 32,000, were placed under criminal
investigation and enforcement (43%)

-----------------------------------------------------------------


The next largest category was corrections (21%) with about
16,000, followed by police response and patrol with 12,000 (16%)
and noncriminal investigation and enforcement with just under
10,000 (13%).  Smaller numbers performed duties related to court
operations (4%), or security and protection (3%).  (See page 10
for definitions of job function categories.)

Nearly half (44%) of the 12,403 INS officers with the authority
to make arrest and carry firearms were Border Patrol agents. 
Border Patrol agents interdict undocumented aliens and
contraband, including narcotics.  These 5,441 agents were all
categorized under the police response and patrol category, and
account for nearly half of the Federal officers in that category.

The next largest group of INS personnel with arrest and firearms
authority were the 3,401 immigration inspectors working at ports
of entry.  These officers were all categorized under the
noncriminal investigation and enforcement category.  

The INS also employed 1,859 criminal investigators and
immigration agents responsible for investigating crimes within
its jurisdiction, and 1,702 detention and deportation officers. 

BOP correctional officers formed a large majority of the Federal
officers categorized under the corrections category.  As of June
1996, 11,329 such officers maintained the security of BOP
institutions and the 94,000 inmates 

in custody.  Daily correctional officer duties include providing
custody and supervision of inmates, conducting searches for
contraband, and responding to emergencies and disturbances.
***Footnote 1:  In addition to correctional officers, BOP
provides another 13,000 employees with arrest and firearms
authority, so that they can perform these duties an necessary. 
The BJS survey limited its count to the full-time correctional
officers in BOP facilities who performed these duties as their
primary function.***

The FBI employed 10,389 full-time personnel with arrest and
firearms authority.  Nearly all were agents, responsible for
criminal investigation and enforcement. FBI agents have broad
investigative responsibilities covering more than 250 Federal
crimes including bank fraud, embezzlement, kidnaping, and civil
rights violations.  The FBI has concurrent jurisdiction with
another DOJ agency, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),
over drug offenses under the Controlled Substances Act.  

The DEA employed 2,946 officers with the authority to make
arrests and carry firearms.  These DEA agents primarily
investigate major narcotics violators, enforce regulations
governing the manufacture and dispensing of controlled
substances, and perform a variety of other functions in support
of drug trafficking prevention and control.

Also within the Justice Department is the U.S. Marshals Service
which employed 2,650 officers with arrest and firearms authority
as of June 1996.  All of these officers were categorized under
the court operations category; however, the agency has a wide
range of responsibilities.

The Marshals Service receives all persons arrested by Federal
agencies and is responsible for their custody and transportation
until they are sentenced.  It also transfers sentenced Federal
inmates between facilities with the help of the BOP. 
Additionally, the Marshals Service has jurisdiction over Federal
fugitive matters:  escaped prisoners;  violators of probation,
parole, and releases on bond; and persons under DEA warrants. 

Among the other responsibilities of the U.S. Marshals Service
are management of the Federal Asset Seizure and Forfeiture and
Federal Witness Security Programs, providing security for
Federal judicial facilities and personnel, controlling riots on
Federal property, and escorting missile convoys.

Treasury Department agencies 
___________________________________


Treasury Department agencies employed about a fourth of all
Federal officers with arrest and firearms authority.  The U.S.
Customs Service, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S.
Secret Service, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
(ATF) were the major employers.

The U.S. Customs Service employed 9,749 officers with arrest and
firearms authority.  This total included 3,540 criminal
investigators and 6,197 inspectors performing noncriminal
investigation and enforcement functions.  

Customs Service officers interdict and seize contraband entering
the United States, process persons and items entering through
U.S. ports of entry, and administer certain navigational laws. 
The Customs Service has investigative responsibilities covering
more than 400 laws related to customs, drugs, export control,
and revenue fraud.  

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the second largest Treasury
Department employer of officers with arrest and firearms
authority, had 3,784 such personnel as of June 1996. 
Eighty-nine percent worked in the Criminal Investigation
Division, and 11% were employed by Internal Security.  IRS
agents primarily investigate tax fraud.   

Next largest was the U.S. Secret Service which employed 3,185
full-time personnel with the authority to make arrests and carry
firearms. The total included 2,034 agents with criminal
investigation and enforcement duties primarily related to
counterfeiting, financial crimes, computer fraud, and threats
against dignitaries.

The remainder of Secret Service officers belonged to the
Uniformed Division.  These officers, all categorized under the
police response and patrol category, provide protection for the
White House Complex and other Presidential Offices, the Main
Treasury Building and Annex, the President and Vice President
and members of their immediate family, and foreign diplomatic
missions.

ATF employed 1,869 officers with arrest and firearms authority
as of June 1996.  ATF is primarily responsible for investigating
the criminal use of firearms and explosives and for enforcing
Federal laws that tax or regulate alcohol and tobacco.

Outside of the Departments of Justice and Treasury, the largest
employers of Federal officers with arrest and firearms authority
were the U.S. Postal Service, the Administrative Office of the
U.S. Courts, and the National Park Service.  

Of the 3,576 officers employed by the U.S. Postal Inspection
Service, 61% were classified under the criminal investigation
and enforcement category.  The remaining 1,388 officers provided
security for Postal Service facilities, employees, and assets.



As of June 1996 the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts,
Federal Corrections and Supervision Division  employed 3,473 probation
officers, and 2,777 of them had arrest and firearms authority.  
***Footnote 2:  All Federal probation officers have arrest
powers over probationers and supervised releasees.  However, the
chief judge in each of the 93 federal judicial districts with a
probation office decides whether the probation officers in that
district are permitted to carry firearms in the performance of
their duties.  As of June 1996, 86 districts permitted their
probation officers to carry a firearm.*** These officers are
responsible for supervising Federal offenders on probation or
supervised release, and arresting violators.

The National Park Service employed 2,148 full-time personnel
with arrest and firearms authority at the time of  the BJS
survey.  This included 1,543 park rangers (about a third of all
rangers) who were commissioned as law enforcement officers. 
Additional rangers serving seasonally were also commissioned
officers, but the survey considered them to be part-time. 

The Park Service total also includes 605 U.S. Park Police
officers.  Although most Park Police officers are in the
Washington, D.C., area, they are authorized to provide police
services for the entire National Park System.  

Other Federal agencies that employed 500 or more full-time
personnel authorized to make arrests and carry firearms as of
June 1996, included the following:  

The U.S. Capitol Police employed 1,031 officers to provide
police response and patrol (79%) and other law enforcement
services for the U.S. Capitol grounds and buildings.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Division of Law Enforcement
employed 869 officers to enforce Federal wildlife and
environmental laws in the National Wildlife Refuge System.  A
majority were refuge officers, with most having collateral law
enforcement duties related to police response and patrol. The
remainder were special agents responsible for criminal
investigations. 

The General Services Administration (GSA) employed 643 officers
in its Federal Protective Service.  These officers performed
police response and patrol (90%) and criminal investigation (9%)
duties related to Federal buildings and property and the
employees and visitors using them. 

The U.S. Forest Service employed 619 officers responsible for
criminal investigation and enforcement services related to
National Forest System lands, facilities, and users.

Overall, the 16 Federal agencies employing 500 or more officers
accounted for about 70,000, or 94%, of the Federal officers
covered by the BJS survey.  Excluding offices of inspector
general, there were 11 Federal agencies that employed at least
100 but fewer than 500 full-time personnel with the authority to
make arrests and carry firearms.

--------------------------------------------------------
 

The largest of these was the U.S. State Department's Bureau of
Diplomatic Security with 367 officers.  Nearly all of these
officers were categorized under security and protection because
their primary function is to protect visiting dignitaries.  The
agency's investigative functions cover passport and visa fraud,
and threats made against foreign missions in the United States,
foreign dignitaries, or Federal employees.

The next largest employers were Amtrak, with 342 full-time
officers within its Police Division, and the Interior
Department's Bureau of Indian Affairs which employed 339 within
its Office of Law Enforcement.  Other agencies employing at
least 100 officers included the Tennessee Valley Authority, the
Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the Environmental Protection
Agency, the Food and Drug Administration -- Office of Criminal
Investigations, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration -- National Marine Fisheries Service, and the
Library of Congress.

the Bureau of Export Administration -- Office of Export
Enforcement, the Government Printing Office, the National
Institutes of Health, the Federal Air Marshals, the National
Institute of Standards and Technology, the Smithsonian National
Zoological Park, the Bureau of Reclamation, and the Veterans

At the time of the 1993 BJS survey, most of these offices 
had their investigators deputized by the Justice Department 
on a case-by-case basis; however, these agencies are now granted 
a blanket, yearly deputization.  Offices of inspector general 
are responsible for investigating criminal violations and 
for preventing and detecting fraud, waste, and abuse related 
to Federal programs, operations, and employees.



According to General Accounting Office data for fiscal 1996, the
Departments of Defense (363) and Agriculture (248) employed the
largest number of deputized investigators.  Others with 100 or
more included Health and Human Services (165), Labor (145),
Social Security Administration (135), Justice (111), and Housing
and Urban Development (109).

Trends in employment of Federal officers, 1993 versus 1996
___________________________________________________________


Excluding offices of inspector general, the number of Federal
officers with arrest and firearms authority increased about 6%
between December 1993 and June 1996. 

Among agencies employing 1,000 or more officers with arrest and
firearms authority, the INS had the largest  change, from 9,466
to 12,403 -- an increase of 2,937, or 31%.

Large increases were reported by two other Justice Department
agencies as well.  The U.S. Marshals Service had the second
largest percentage change, an increase of 23%, from 2,153 to
2,650.   The BOP had the second largest increase in terms of
numbers from 9,984 to 11,329, an increase of 1,345, or 13%.  

The DEA and the IRS both increased their number of officers
about 5%, and the FBI, about 3%.  The FBI employed about 300
more agents in 1996 than 1993.

Two large employers of Federal officers showed a decrease in
employment of officers with arrest and firearms authority. 
Compared to 1993  the U.S. Customs Service in 1996 had 371, or
4%, fewer officers, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and
Firearms had 90 fewer, a decrease of 5%.  The U.S. Postal
Inspection Service showed virtually no change from 1993 to 1996,
remaining at just under 3,600 officers.   

______________________________________________________________
Federal law enforcement officers killed and assaulted, 1991-95


The Uniform Crime Reports Division of the FBI compiles data
annually on law enforcement officers killed or assaulted in the
United States and its territories.  According to these data, 
Federal law enforcement officers experienced 3,886 assaults
during the five-year period 1991-95, an average of nearly 800
per year.  A total of 1,165, or 30%, of these assaults resulted
in personal injury to the officer, and 21 resulted in an
officer's death.

About 37%, or 3 in 8, of all assaults on Federal officers
involved the use of personal weapons, and 13%, or 1 in 8, the
use of a firearm.   Other weapons used included vehicles (8%),
blunt objects (5%), knives (2%), and bombs (1%).  Twenty percent
of assaults involved a threat. 


Types of assaults on 
Federal officers, 1991-95


  Personal weapon   38% 
  Threat            20
  Firearm           13
  Vehicle            8
  Blunt object       5
  Knife              2
  Bomb               1
  Other             12



The largest percentage of assaults on Federal officers occurred
while the officer was on patrol or guard duty (34%).  Twenty-one
percent were assaulted while conducting an investigation or
search, and 14% while making an arrest or serving a summons.

Circumstances of assaults 
on Federal officers, 1991-95


Patrol/guard duty        34%  
Investigation/search     21
Arrest/summons           14
Custody of prisoners      5
Office duty               4
Court duty                1
Protection duty           1
Other duties             20

The FBI data do not include assaults on Bureau of Prisons staff;
however, BJS collects such data as part of its Census of State
and Federal Correctional Facilities.  In 1995 alone, there were
1,124 assaults on Federal prison staff resulting in 1 death. 
Over its 67-year history BOP has experienced an average of one
correctional officer death every 3 years. 

Based on the FBI data, the annual assault rate per 1,000
officers varies greatly among agencies employing 1,000 or more
officers.  Using the average number of assaults per year for the
period 1991-95, the National Park Service had the highest annual
rate, about 52 per 1,000.  Next were the ATF (29.6), the DEA
(25.5) and the INS (25.0).  The lowest assault rates were at the
FBI (3.5 per 1,000) and the IRS (2.6).

Although the FBI data do not provide information below the
agency level, different divisions within an agency may have
dramatically different assault rates.  For example, it is known
that in 1992 there were 228 assaults on Border Patrol agents.  
Even using 1993 employment levels, this is an assault rate of
58.1 per 1,000 officers, considerably higher than the overall
INS rate of 25 per 1,000.
