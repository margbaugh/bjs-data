Highlights

The number of suspects investigations by U.S. attorneys
increased by 5% between 1997 and 1998, from 110,034 to 115,692; 
between 1990 and 1998, the number of investigations increased by
15%.  About three-quarters of those for which the investigation
was concluded were prosecuted -- either before a U.S. district
court judge (61%) or before a U.S. magistrate (12%) -- and 27%
of those investigated were not prosecuted by U.S. attorneys.

The number of defendants prosecuted in Federal courts increased
by 12% between 1997 and 1998, from 69,351 to 78,172.  Almost 40%
of the increase was attributable to the increase in the number
of defendants prosecuted for drug offenses;  29% was
attributable to the increase in the number prosecuted for
immigration offenses.

The number of offenders under Federal correctional supervision
increased 42% between 1990 and 1998.  At the end of fiscal year
1998, the number of offenders under Federal correctional
supervision was 201,693 compared to 141,790 during 1990.

At the end of fiscal year 1998, the number of Federal inmates
serving a sentence of imprisonment surpassed 100,000 for the
first time -- increasing by 9,670 to 108,925.  The number under
community supervision was 92,768.  Almost two-thirds of those
under community supervision  were on post-incarceration
supervised release (54,822) or were on parole (5,827).

Arrests

During 1998, 106,139 offenders were arrested by Federal law
enforcement agencies for violations of Federal law. A third of
all arrests were for public order offenses, 29% for drug
offenses, 16% for property offenses, 14% for supervision
violations, 5% for violent offenses, and 3% to secure and
safeguard a material witness.

About 73% of all arrests for Federal offenses were made by
agencies of the Department of Justice, while Treasury Department
agencies accounted for 11% of all arrests.  Within the
Department of Justice, 37% of arrests were made by the U.S.
Marshals Service, one-third of arrests were made by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, 15% were made by the
FBI, and 14% were made by the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Prosecution

During 1998 U.S. attorneys initiated criminal investigations
involving 115,692 suspects, and they concluded their
investigations of 106,022 suspects.  Thirty-five percent of the
suspects were investigated for public-order, 32% for drug, 26%
for property, and about 7% for violent offenses.

The number of suspects investigated for immigration offenses
increased by more than 50% between 1997 and 1998, from 9,366 to
14,114. 

Of the suspects in criminal matters concluded, U.S. attorneys
prosecuted 64,993 in U.S. district courts and 12,243 were
disposed of before U.S. Magistrates.  Declinations by U.S.
attorneys have reached an all time low of 27% of matters
concluded during 1998.

Suspects in criminal matters involving drug or violent offenses
were slightly more likely to be prosecuted in a U.S. district
court (77% and 63%, respectively) than were the suspects
involved in public-order or property offenses (54% and 52%,
respectively).  Suspects involved in property offenses (such as
fraud) or regulatory public-order offenses were more likely to
be declined for prosecution (40% and 64%, respectively) than
were the suspects investigated for drug or violent offenses (18%
and 33%, respectively).

Pretrial release

During 1998 about 43% of the 60,950 defendants who terminated
pretrial services were released at some time prior to their
criminal trial.  Defendants charged with property offenses such
as embezzlement, fraud, and larceny and those charged with
regulatory public-order offenses or tax law violations were more
likely to be released prior to trial (between 68% and 95% of
these defendants were released) than were defendants charged
with violent offenses, drug trafficking, weapons, or immigration
offenses (between 8% and 43% of these defendants were released).

The proportion of defendants released prior to their trial
decreased by nearly a third, from 62% during 1990 to 43% during
1998.  Violent, drug, weapon, and immigration offenders were
considerably less likely to be released during 1998 than during
1990.  During 1990, 45% of violent, 54% of drug, 63% of weapon,
and 30% of immigration offenders were released at some point
prior to trial.  By contrast, during 1998, 32% of violent, 35%
of drug, 43% of weapon, and 8% of immigration offenders were
released.

Defendants having a prior criminal history of serious or violent
crimes were less likely to be released than those without a
prior criminal history; defendants with more criminal history
were less likely to be released than those with less criminal
history.  Twenty-two percent of the defendants with a prior
violent felony conviction were released before trial, while 54%
of the defendants with no prior convictions were released. 
Forty-six percent of defendants with one prior conviction were
released, as compared to 34% of defendants having two to four
prior convictions and 23% of defendants having five or more
prior convictions.

About 84% of the defendants released prior to trial completed
their periods of release without violating the conditions of
their release.  About 16% of defendants released violated the
conditions of their release, and 6% of defendants had their
release revoked.  Defendants charged with drug and violent
offenses were more likely to commit at least one violation of
their conditions of release (27% and 18%, respectively) and to
have their release revoked (10% and 9%, respectively) than were
other defendants.

Defendants released during 1998 were more likely to violate the
conditions of their pretrial release than those released during
1990.  During 1998, 16% of those released at some point prior to
trial violated a condition of their release.  During 1990, 12%
violated their release conditions.

Adjudication

During 1998, 78,172 defendants were charged in Federal courts
with a criminal offense, about 83% of whom were charged with
felonies.  Of the defendants charged with felonies, 43% were
prosecuted for drug trafficking offenses, 28% for public-order
offenses, 23% for property offenses, and 6% for violent offenses.

The number of defendants charged with a felony immigration
offense increased by 38% between 1997 and 1998, from 6,726 to
9,254.  The number charged with a felony drug offense increased
by 13%, from 24,693 to 28,021.

Criminal cases were concluded against 69,769 defendants during
1997, 82% of whom had been charged with felonies. The proportion
of defendants convicted in the Federal courts increased from 81%
during 1990 to 87% during 1998.  Additionally, the proportion of
defendants pleading guilty increased from 88% during 1990 to 94%
during 1998.

Ninety percent of defendants charged with felonies were
convicted.  The conviction rate was about the same for all major
offense categories:  91% of public-order offenders, 90% of
violent, property and drug offenders.  

Sentencing

Defendants convicted during 1998 were more likely to be
sentenced to prison than those convicted during 1990.  During
1998, 71% of defendants were sentenced to prison compared to 60%
of those sentenced during 1990.

About 92% of felony drug offenders and 91% of violent felony
offenders received prison sentences during 1998, as did 83% of
felony public-order offenders and 60% of felony property
offenders.

Drug offenses             78.8
Public-order offenses     47.3
 
Misdemeanors              11.4

The 43,041 offenders sentenced to prison received, on average,
58.8 months of imprisonment.  Offenders sentenced for violent
felony offenses and felony drug offenses received longer average
prison terms (84.2 and 78.8 months, respectively) than those
convicted of felony property and public-order offenses (25.4 and
47.3 months, respectively).

While the proportion of defendants sentenced to prison is at an
all time high, average prison sentences have declined from the
peak attained during 1992.  During 1992 the average prison term
imposed was 62.6 months;  for violent felony offenses, the
average term imposed was 94.8 months;  for drug felonies, the
average term was 84.1 months.

Appeals

Between 1994 and 1998, the number of appeals received by the
U.S. Courts of Appeals remained relatively constant -- between
10,000 and 11,000 annually.  However, the proportion of criminal
defendants appealing some aspect of their decreased from 21% of
convictions during 1994 to 17% during 1998.

During 1998, 10,535 criminal appeals were filed.  Forty-seven
percent of the appeals filed challenged both the conviction and
sentence imposed.  Only 4% of appeals were filed by the
Government.  Of the 10,105 appeals terminated during 1998, 76%
(or 8,178) were terminated on the merits.  In 82% of the appeals
terminated on the merits, the district court ruling was
affirmed, at least in part.

Corrections

Community supervision

Between 1990 and 1998, the number of offenders on community
supervision increased by 9% from 84,801 during 1990 to 92,768
during 1998. While nearly equal proportions of offenders were
serving terms of probation and post-incarceration supervision
(parole or supervised release) during 1990, during 1998, almost
two-thirds were serving a term of post-incarceration supervision
(59% supervised release and 6% parole) while 35% were on
probation.  Drug offenders comprised 53% of offenders under
terms of supervised release during 1998, 52% of offenders on
parole, and 11% of offenders on probation.  Property offenders
comprised 38% of offenders on probation, 27% of offenders
serving terms of supervised release, and 11% of offenders on
parole.

A total of 16,011 offenders completed their terms of probation
during 1998.  Most of these offenders (81%) completed their
terms of probation successfully,.  Eleven percent of
probationers terminating supervision during 1998 committed
technical violations; 5% committed new crimes.

A total of 19,878 offenders completed terms of supervised
release during 1998.  Of these offenders, 64% successfully
completed their terms without violating conditions of release;
21% committed technical violations; and 12% committed new crimes.

A total of 3,077 offenders completed terms of parole during
1998.  Of these offenders, 56% successfully completed their
terms without violating conditions of release; 26% committed
technical violations; and 13% committed new crimes.

Prison

Between 1990 and 1998, the number of inmates serving a sentence
of imprisonment increased by 91% from 56,989 during 1990 to
108,925 during 1998.  During 1998, the number of sentenced
inmates increased by 9,670 to surpass 100,000 for the first time.

During 1998, 42,598 prisoners were received by the Bureau of
Prisons from U.S. district court commitments.  An additional
15,617 prisoners were returned to Federal prison for violating
conditions of probation, parole, or supervised release, or were
admitted to Federal prison from elsewhere than a U.S. district
court.

Drug offenders -- who comprised about 40% of persons admitted
into Federal prison -- comprised the largest percentage of
persons in prison (58%) at the end of 1998.

During 1998, 34,504 prisoners were released for the first time
from Federal prison after commitment by a U.S. district court. 
Of these, 31,200 were released by standard methods and 3,304
were released by extraordinary means (death, treaty transfer,
sentence commutation, or drug treatment).  An additional 14,041
prisoners were released from subsequent commitments to Federal
prison.

Time served by Federal offenders increased from 17 months during
1990 to 28 months during 1998.  Additionally, the proportion of
the sentence served increased from 65% during 1990 to 87% during
1998.

Violent and drug offenders were among those offenders who served
the longest prison terms.  However, while time served for
violent offenders remained relatively constant between 1990 and
1998, approximately 58 months, time served by drug offenders
increased by 57%, from 26 months during 1990 to 41 months during
1998.

Introduction

This Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) report presents an
overview of case processing in the Federal criminal justice
system.  The data presented are compiled from the BJS Federal
Justice Statistics Program (FJSP) database.  The FJSP database
includes data provided by the Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts, the Executive Office for the U.S. Attorneys, the Federal
Bureau of Prisons, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the U.S.
Sentencing Commission.  The Administrative Office of the U.S.
Courts, in addition to providing data describing defendants in
cases processed by the Federal judiciary, provides data
describing defendants processed by the Federal pretrial services
agencies and the Federal probation and supervision service.  The
BJS Federal Justice Statistics database is archived on CD-ROM,
copies of which are available from the BJS Clearinghouse.  The
data can be downloaded from the Federal Justice Statistics
Resource Center located at http://fjsrc.urban.org.

Each agency reports on those defendants it processed during a
given year in an annual statistical report.  These agency
reports are often incomparable due to the varying methods the
agencies use to report case processing activities.  As reported
by an interagency working group, headed by BJS, the differences
in the case processing statistics are attributable, in part, to
the differing needs and missions of the agencies.  The working
group found the following differences in reported statistics:

*  the universe of cases reported during a given period -- some
agencies report on those case processing events that occurred
during a particular period, whereas others report on those
events recorded during a particular period; and

*  many of the commonly used case processing statistics --
suspect/defendant processed, offense committed, disposition, and
sentence imposed -- are defined differently across agencies.

BJS, through its FJSP, has recognized the incomparability of
these annual statistical reports and has attempted to reconcile
many of the differences identified by the working group.  For
instance, by combining databases from several years, BJS is able
to report on those cases that actually occurred during the
reporting period.  Additionally, commonly used case processing
statistics are made comparable across stages by applying uniform
definitions to data obtained from each agency.  Because
definitions in the FJSP are consistent with those categories in
BJS programs describing State defendants convicted, sentenced,
or imprisoned, the comparison of Federal and State case
processing statistics is facilitated.

The 1998 Compendium, 13th in a series which includes 1984, 1985,
1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997,
describes defendants processed at each stage of the Federal
justice system -- arrest by Federal law enforcement agencies
(chapter 1), investigation and prosecution by the U.S. attorneys
(chapter 2), pretrial release or detention (chapter 3),
adjudication in the U.S. district courts (chapter 4), sentencing
(chapter 5), appeal of the conviction and/or sentence imposed
(chapter 6), and corrections (chapter 7) -- for the 12-month
period ending September 30, 1998 (the Federal fiscal year). 
Prior to 1994, the Compendium was reported on a calendar-year
basis.

The tables presented report events that occurred during the
Federal fiscal year -- October 1, 1997 - September 30, 1998. 
Generally, the tables include both individual and organizational
defendants.  Organizational defendants are not included in
tables describing pretrial release and detention or tables
showing defendants sentenced to incarceration.  Juvenile
offenders are included in the reported statistics.  Felony and
misdemeanor distinctions are provided where possible (see
"Offense classifications" in Methodology).

Organization of the 
Compendium

Each chapter of the Compendium describes a major stage in the
processing of criminal suspects and defendants.  Each chapter
contains Chapter notes that describe the universes of data used
in the tables and information relevant to the interpretation of
individual tables.  The Compendium contains the following:

Chapter 1. This chapter describes arrests made by Federal law
enforcement agencies for violations of Federal law, including
the characteristics of arrestees.

Chapter 2.  This chapter describes decisions made by Federal
prosecutors in screening criminal matters and the
characteristics of defendants in cases prosecuted or declined
for prosecution.

Chapter 3.  This chapter describes the pretrial release and
detention practices of the Federal judiciary, including the
characteristics of defendants detained or released pending trial.

Chapter 4.  This chapter describes actions by the Federal
judiciary in adjudicating defendants in cases filed by the U.S.
attorneys, including the offense charged and characteristics of
defendants convicted.

Chapter 5.  This chapter describes the sentences imposed by the
Federal judiciary on convicted defendants, including the
characteristics of defendants sentenced.

Chapter 6.  This chapter describes appeals of criminal
convictions and sentences imposed in the Federal courts,
including the original offense charged.

Chapter 7.  This chapter describes defendants under Federal
correctional supervision -- probation, parole, and supervised
release -- including the outcome of the supervision (successful
completion or violations), admissions to and releases from
Federal prison, and time served by Federal inmates.

Methodology.  This section describes the procedures followed in
analyzing data and developing tables.

Glossary.  This section contains definitions for terms used in
the Compendium.  Since many terms used in the text and tables
have specialized meanings (either because they refer to Federal
law or because of reporting procedures by the Federal agencies
supplying the data), readers are encouraged to check the
glossary for exact definitions of tabulated data.

Comparing Case Processing Statistics.  This document, prepared
by an interagency working group tasked to reconcile differences
in Federal criminal case processing statistics, identifies and
describes the major differences in the way Federal criminal
justice agencies collect, tabulate, and report criminal case
processing events.

Modifications in the 1998 
Compendium

A new chapter (chapter 1), which describes arrests made by
Federal agencies for violations of Federal law, has been
introduced in the 1998 Compendium.  The chapter includes three
tables:  a table showing arrests for violations of Federal law,
by offense; a table showing arrests for violations of Federal
law, by the arresting Federal law enforcement agency, by major
offense; and a table showing characteristics of suspects
arrested for violations of Federal law, by major offense.

Due to the introduction of this new chapter on Federal arrests,
chapter numbers for the chapters retained from the previous
Compendium have been incremented by one.  The prosecution
chapter is now chapter 2; pretrial release and detention,
chapter 3; adjudication, chapter 4; sentencing, chapter 5;
appeals, chapter 6; and corrections, chapter 7.

A new table has been introduced to the prosecution chapter which
shows the declination rate by investigative agency and
department (table 2.3).

In the corrections chapter, the table showing characteristics of
first releases from prison (table 7.15) and the table showing
mean time served to first release (table 7.16) have changed. 
Rather than displaying statistics separately for new law cases
as well as all cases,  these tables now show only all cases,
since new law cases comprise 98% of all first releases.

Notes to reader

The tables in the Compendium were constructed to permit valid
comparisons within each table and to allow the reader to compare
percentages (but not raw totals) across tables.  It should be
understood, however, that the total number of subjects/defendants 
shown in a particular table may not equal the number of subjects/
defendants involved in a particular stage of processing, since 
some records could not be linked and some data sources did not 
include information on particular data elements classified in a 
particular table.  Data notes indicate the exact universe for 
individual tables.

The Compendium is a statistical presentation of Federal criminal
justice information with limited analyses of trends or
explanatory factors underlying the statistics.  Analyses of
Federal justice statistics may be found in special reports and
other publications, some of which are cited in the Compendium. 
Assessment of changing patterns in the Compendium tabulations
may depend on detailed examination of subcategories not shown in
the tabulations or may require other sources of information,
such as knowledge of legislation or Federal agency procedures.

Chapter 1. 
Arrests for Federal offenses 


Chapter notes

Sixty-six Federal agencies employ full-time personnel empowered
to make arrests.  As of June 1998, these agencies employed about
83,000 officers. ***Footnote 1: Brian A. Reaves, Federal Law Enforcement,
1996, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Washington, DC (NCJ-164617.***
More than half (56%) of all law enforcement officers were employed 
by the Department of Justice.  The Department of Treasury employed 
24% of all officers.

Offenders arrested by Federal agencies are transferred to the
custody of the U.S. Marshals Service for processing, transportation, 
and detention. ***Footnote 2: The Federal agency making the arrest may be 
different from the Federal agency initiating the investigation involving
the arrestee.  Statistics describing agencies initiating investigations are
shown in table 2.3 of chapter 2, "Prosecution."***  During 1998, the U.S.
Marshals Service received 104,422 offenders for processing from the Federal
law enforcement agencies, including nearly 29,000 offenders arrested by 
deputy U.S. marshals.

Arrests by offense 
category (table 1.1)

During 1998, 104,422 offenders were arrested by Federal law
enforcement agencies for violations of Federal law.  A third of
all arrests were for public or-der offenses; 29% for drug
offenses; 16% for property offenses; 15% for supervision
violations; 5% for violent offenses; and 3% to secure and
safeguard a material witness.

Approximately 41% of drug arrests involved cocaine; 28%,
marijuana; 10%, amphetamine (or methamphetamine); 4%, heroin;
and the remainder other drugs or drug paraphernalia (figure 1.1).

Almost two-thirds of arrests for public-order offenses were
immigration offenses.  Most (80%) of these were for illegal
entry into the United States; 13% involved alien smuggling; 6%
involved false claims of citizenship by entrants to the United
States; and about 1% involved other immigration violations
(figure 1.2).

Arrests by law enforcement 
agencies (table 1.2)

During 1998, 72% of all arrests for Federal offenses were made
by components of the Department of Justice; the Treasury
components accounted for 11% of all arrests.  In addition, 3% of
arrests were made by State and local agencies and 8% of
offenders were arrested after voluntarily reporting to the U.S.
marshals following a summons.

Of those arrests made by the Department of Justice, the U.S.
Marshals Service made 37%; the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, 33%; the FBI, 15%; the Drug Enforcement Administration,
14%; and other Department of Justice agencies, less than 1%.

Of those arrests made by the Treasury Department, the U.S.
Customs Service made 57%; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and
Firearms, 18%; the Secret Service, 18%; and the IRS, 7%.

Arrests across demographic groups (table 1.3)

Most (85%) of offenders arrested by Federal law enforcement
agencies during 1998 were male.  Seventy percent were white and
25% were black.  Individuals between 21 and 40 years old
comprised nearly 70% of all those arrested.  One-third of those
arrested were identified as noncitizens.

Most (68%) offenders arrested for drug offenses were white,
while 29% were black.  Of those offenders arrested on charges
involving cocaine, 59% were white and 38% were black.  Of those
offenders arrested on charges involving marijuana, 83% were
white and 14% were black (figure 1.1).

Chapter notes

Tables 1.1-1.3 were derived from the U.S. Marshals Prisoner
Tracking System database.  Only records of arrests made during
October 1, 1997, through September 30, 1998, were selected. 
Information on individual cases, offenses, and detainees were
used to construct the tables.

Offenses of arrest were classified by the U.S. Marshals into
their four-digit offense codes.  These were then aggregated into
the offense categories shown in the tables.  These categories
are similar, but may not be directly comparable, to the
categories used in tables in other chapters of this Compendium.

Chapter 2
Prosecution


Federal criminal cases may be brought by the U.S. Attorney's 
Office, by the Criminal Division of the U.S. Department of 
Justice, or by other authorized agencies such as the U.S.
Marshals Service.  The 93 U.S. attorneys serve as the chief
Federal law enforcement officers within their respective districts.

Investigations are most commonly referred to a U.S. attorney by
a Federal investigative agency (primarily the Drug Enforcement
Administration; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; the Postal
Inspection Service; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms; 
and the Secret Service), by the Criminal Division, or by a State or 
local investigative agency.  Investigations may also be initiated 
-- and cases brought directly -- by U.S. attorneys or by the Criminal 
Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.  This chapter reports 
only on suspects that were at least partially investigated by U.S. 
attorneys.

U.S. attorneys' decisions

After criminal investigations are initiated and criminal
suspects are referred to them, U.S. attorneys may file charges
against defendants in a U.S. district court, or they may decline
to file these charges for reasons such as weak or insufficient
evidence, minimal Federal interest, lack of resources, or lack
of criminal intent.  Matters that are declined may be referred
to another authority for prosecution or be settled through
alternative resolution procedures.  U.S. attorneys may also file
cases before U.S. magistrates, who have the authority to
adjudicate misdemeanor offenses (18 U.S.C. § 3401).  Because of
the relatively less serious nature of these cases, and because
they are handled by magistrates, the U.S. attorneys count these
cases as criminal matters disposed by U.S. magistrates.

The decision to prosecute a suspect in a criminal matter depends
upon many factors, including the Attorney General's priorities,
U.S. attorney priorities and resources, laws governing each type
of offense, and the strength of evidence in each case.

During 1998, 61% of suspects in all offense categories were
prosecuted before U.S. district court, while an additional 12%
were handled by U.S. magistrates.  Suspects were prosecuted at
different rates depending on their offense.  Suspects involved
in violent and drug offenses were more likely to be prosecuted
before U.S. district court judges than were those involved in
property and public-order offenses (figure 2.1).  Suspects
involved in drug offenses were the most likely (77%) to be
prosecuted.  Suspects involved in property offenses were the
least likely to be prosecuted (52%).  However, suspects involved
in property offenses were more likely to have their matters
declined and not referred to other authorities for prosecution
(31%) than were suspects involved in other types of criminal
matters.  These cases were resolved by other means, including
restitution, civil/administrative procedures, and pretrial
diversion.

Suspects in matters received 
(table 2.1)

During 1998 there were 115,692 suspects in new matters received
for investigation by U.S. attorneys.**(1 See Chapter notes, Item
1, p. 31.  The 1998 data are not directly comparable to the 1993 
and prior compendia)**. Of these suspects, about 35% were investigated 
for public-order offenses, 32% for drug offenses, and 26% for property
offenses.  Under 7% of all suspects were investigated for violent crimes. 
Relative percentages of offenses reflect criminal activity as well as
Federal investigative, prosecutorial, and statutory priorities.
For example, during 1998 priority areas for U.S. attorneys included the
detention, educational and rehabilitation of juveniles, drug and violent
crimes (including firearms prosecutions), international terrorism, and
prosecution of those responsible for hate crimes and attacks on houses of
worship (with the National Church Arson Task Force).**(2 Statistical Report,
United States Attorneys' Offices, Fiscal Year 1998.  U.S. Department
of Justice, Executive Office for United States Attorneys, Washington,
DC.)**

Suspects in matters concluded 
(tables 2.2-2.6)

Upon receiving a matter, a U.S. attorney will either immediately
decline it for prosecution or investigate further.  Upon
conclusion of the investigation, a matter may be filed as a
criminal case in a U.S. district court, referred to a U.S.
magistrate, or declined for   prosecution.  Of the 106,022
suspects in criminal matters concluded during 1998,  61% were
prosecuted in U.S. district court, 27% were declined for
prosecution, and 12% were referred to U.S. magistrates.

Suspects prosecuted (table 2.2) -- The likelihood of prosecution
in U.S. district court varied widely across offense categories. 
Drug and violent offenders were more likely to be prosecuted
than those involved in property and public-order offenses.  U.S.
attorneys prosecuted approximately 77% of suspects involved in
drug offenses, 63% of those in violent offenses, 54% of those in
public-order offenses, and 52% of those in property offenses.

Differences in rates of prosecution within major categories were
substantial.  For example, among violent offenders, 79% of
robbery suspects were prosecuted, while 57% of murder, 50% of
assault, and 41% of rape suspects were prosecuted.  Among
property offenders, suspects investigated for counterfeiting
were prosecuted at a higher rate than those involved in fraud
(70% compared with 51%), and among suspects involved in
public-order offenses, immigration (79%), weapons (70%), and tax
law violators (65%) were much more likely to be prosecuted than
suspects in escape (21%) and civil rights (6%) offenses.

Suspects in matters concluded and declined, by investigating
agency (table 2.3) -- During 1998, 59% of suspects in matters
concluded were investigated by components of the Department of
Justice; the Treasury Department investigated 19% of suspects in
matters concluded.  In addition, 10% of suspects in matters
concluded were investigated by independent Federal agencies and
State/local agencies.

Among the investigating agencies, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (3%) and the National Park Service (10%)
had among the lowest declination rates, while the Indian Affairs
Bureau (58%), agencies within the Department of Health and Human
Services (53%), and the Environmental Protection Agency (53%)
were among agencies with the highest declination rates.  The
declination rate for matters investigated by components of the
Department of Justice (28%) was quite close to the overall
declination rate (27%).

Suspects in matters declined (tables 2.4-2.5) -- Suspects in
matters involving violent offenses were less likely to be
declined for prosecution (33%) than those involved in property
offenses (40%) but more likely than those in drug offenses
(18%).  Suspects in public-order offenses were slightly less
likely to be declined for prosecution than those involved in
violent offenses-- 25% compared to 33% (table 2.2).

The decision to decline prosecution is based on a number of
factors, including the lack of prosecutable offense, alternative
resolution, or case- and suspect-related reasons (table 2.4). 
Of the 28,786 declinations during 1998, 27% occurred because of
case-related reasons, mostly due to weak evidence (22%); 24%
occurred because there was no crime or criminal intent was
lacking; and 18% occurred for other reasons, such as agency
requests (7%) and minimal Federal interest (4%).

Not all suspects whose matters were declined for prosecution
avoided prosecution.  Twenty-four percent of the suspects in
matters declined were referred to another authority for
prosecution (table 2.5).  An additional 5% were settled through
alternative resolution procedures.  While suspects involved in
property offenses constituted the largest number of suspects who
were referred by U.S. attorneys to other authorities for
prosecution or resolution, suspects involved in drug offenses
were the most likely of suspects whose matters were declined to
be referred to other authorities for prosecution or alternative
resolution (figure 2.2).  Thirty-six percent of the drug
suspects whose matters were declined prosecution by U.S.
attorneys were referred for other prosecution or resolution, as
were 27% of the public-order, 27% of violent, and 25% of the
property offense suspects.

Within major offense categories, the likelihood that suspects in
matters declined for prosecution were referred to other
authorities for prosecution or alternative resolution varied
among specific offenses.  Within property offenses, referral
occurred with 42% of persons involved in motor vehicle theft,
compared to 18% of suspects in arson and explosives cases. 
Within public-order offenses, 39% of weapons suspects and 60% of
escape suspects were referred to other authorities or had their
case settled through alternative procedures, compared to 6% of
suspects in civil rights cases.

Defendants in cases concluded by U.S. magistrates (table 2.2) --
Cases concluded by U.S. magistrates are, by statute,
misdemeanors. (**3 At the time that U.S. attorneys receive them, 
matters may not be classifiable as felonies or misdemeanors.  If a 
U.S. magistrate disposes for a case -- or what the U.S. attorneys 
call a "matter" -- its offense level has been determined to be a
misdemeanor.)** Overall, U.S. magistrates disposed of 12% of all 
criminal matters investigated by U.S. attorneys.  For most offenses, 
the likelihood that a U.S. magistrate concluded the matter was also 
relatively low.  The most notable exception was escape, for which 55% 
of matters were concluded by U.S. magistrates.  The escape offense 
category accounted for 13% of all cases concluded by U.S. magistrates.

Most of the 2,805 escape violations were against defendants who
absconded to avoid prosecution in State courts, the so-called
"unlawful flight to avoid prosecution."  Upon apprehension of
the fugitive, these cases are normally dismissed by U.S.
magistrates and turned over to the State for prosecution on the
original warrant.

Other types of offenses having comparably high rates of disposal
by U.S. magistrates included migratory birds offenses (85%);
conspiracy, aiding and abetting, traffic, and jurisdictional
offenses (69%); and other property violations (61%).

Processing times (table 2.6) -- For matters concluded during
1998, the average number of months from receipt of a matter to
its conclusion by a U.S. attorney as a case filing or
declination or its disposal by a U.S. magistrate was 8.2 months.
However, the time to process matters varied with the outcome of
the matter.  Matters concluded by U.S. magistrates in which the
suspect was convicted took the least amount of time -- an
average of 3.0 months, and at least 50% of these convictions
occurred in about 40 days.  Similarly, 50% of the matters
declined for prosecution were declined within 12.5 months.

Overall, suspects in violent and drug offenses were processed
more quickly than suspects in other offenses.  For key
decisions, such as whether to file a case or decline a matter
for prosecution, drug offenses were concluded slightly quicker
than violent offenses (5.3 months compared to 5.8 months).  At
an average of 13.6 months, fraudulent property offenses took
longer to conclude than other offenses.

Chapter notes

1) Tables 2.1-2.6 were created from the Central System data
files of the EOUSA.  For table 2.1, only records which showed a
matter received during 1998 were selected.  For tables 2.2-2.6,
only records which show a matter terminated by reason of
declination, disposition by a U.S. magistrate, or filed as a
case in U.S. district court from October 1, 1997, through
September 30, 1998, were selected.  In all of these tables,
matters "declined immediately" -- those cases in which the U.S.
attorney spent less than 1 hour investigating -- were excluded.

2) The number of suspects in matters investigated in table 2.1,
and the number of suspects in matters concluded in tables 2.2
and 2.6 are not directly comparable to counts in the 1993 and
prior compendia.  In those years, these statistics included
appellants in appeals filed or appeals terminated.  In table 2.1
of this Compendium and its corresponding tables in 1994 and
subsequent compendia, the number of suspects in matters received
is limited to suspects in criminal matters that were filed as
cases in U.S. district courts, handled by U.S. magistrates, or
declined for prosecution.  In the 1993 and prior compendia, the
number of suspects in criminal matters received included
criminal appeals.  To obtain a number of suspects comparable to
the statistic reported in the 1993 and prior compendia, add to
the data in table 2.1 of this Compendium, the number of
appellants in appeals that were handled by U.S. attorneys.

In tables 2.2 and 2.6 of this Compendium and their corresponding
tables in the 1994 and subsequent compendia, the number of
suspects in matters concluded also is limited to those suspects
whose matters were concluded by a case filing in a U.S. district
court, by declination, or by disposition by a U.S. magistrate. 
In the 1993 and prior compendia, this number included appellants
in criminal appeals terminated.

To obtain a number that is comparable to the number reported in
the 1993 and prior compendia, the number of appellants in
appeals terminated and handled by U.S. attorneys needs to be
added to the totals in table 2.2.

3) Offenses in the Central System data files are classified by
the title and section of the United States Code for the most
serious offense investigated, as determined by the assistant
U.S. attorney responsible for the matter.  For tables in this
Compendium, these citations were translated into the
corresponding four-digit offense codes used by the
Administrative Office of the United States Courts (AOUSC). 
These four-digit codes were then aggregated into the categories
shown in the tables.

U.S. Code citations often do not permit detailed classification
of drug offenses by the type of criminal activity involved.  A
person charged with conspiracy is classified under the
substantive offense alleged (for example, conspiracy to defraud
is classified as fraud) unless type of conspiracy cannot be
determined from the U.S. Code citation.  Unclassified
conspiracies are included among "conspiracy, aiding and
abetting, traffic, and jurisdictional offenses" in tables 2.1,
2.2, 2.5, and 2.6.

The most serious offense investigated is based on the criminal
lead charge as determined by the assistant U.S. attorney
responsible for the criminal matter.

4) In the tables in this chapter, the "all offenses" row or
"total declinations" row (in table 2.5) includes records whose
offense category (basis for declination) is missing or
indeterminable.  The percentage distributions in these tables,
however, are based on the number of observations with nonmissing
offenses (basis for declination) values.  The number of missing
values are reported either on a separate line or in a footnote. 

Chapter 3

Pretrial release


The Bail Reform Act of 1984 (18 U.S.C. § 3141) sets the terms
for release and detention of defendants facing charges in
Federal courts.  At the time defendants first appear before a
judicial officer, they may be (1) released on personal
recognizance or unsecured bond; (2) released subject to
conditions imposed by the court, possibly including traditional
bail; (3) temporarily detained without bail (limited to 10
working days) to permit deportation, exclusion, or the
revocation of previously granted conditional release; or (4)
detained pending the outcome of a detention hearing. **(*18
U.S.C. sec. 3142(e) (1984)**

According to the statute, a defendant must be brought before a
judicial officer without "unnecessary delay" upon arrest.  The
judicial officer, who may be a judge but is generally a U.S.
magistrate, determines whether the defendant will be released or
detained prior to trial.  If a hearing is required, the release
decision may be delayed no longer than 3 days (or 5 days if
requested by the defendant).

At the initial appearance a recommendation to detain the
defendant is made by the U.S. attorney and/or the pretrial
services officer.  If the court concurs with the recommendation
to detain the defendant, a pretrial detention hearing is
scheduled -- typically within 1 week of the initial appearance. 
At the pretrial detention hearing evidence is presented to show
cause why the defendant should be detained pending adjudication
of the charges.

Recommendations to detain a defendant are limited to those
instances where the defendant was charged with (1) a crime of
violence, (2) an offense with a statutory maximum sentence of
life imprisonment or death, (3) a drug offense with a statutory
maximum sentence of 10 years or more imprisonment, or (4) any
felony offense if the defendant had been convicted on two or
more occasions of an offense described above or a similar
State-level offense.  Additionally, a detention recommendation
may be made if there is a serious risk that the defendant would
flee in an attempt to avoid prosecution or would obstruct
justice or intimidate witnesses or jurors.

Types of pretrial release

Defendants may be released without financial conditions
according to the following:

Personal recognizance -- defendant is released subject to no
financial or other conditions.

Unsecured bond -- no money is required to be posted before
release, but defendant is liable for full bail amount if he or
she fails to appear.

Conditional release -- any combination of restrictions that are
deemed necessary to guarantee the defendant's appearance at
trial or the safety of the community.  Non-financial conditions
commonly place restrictions on the defendant's movements,
associations, and/or actions.  They may also involve employment
or treatment for medical, psychological, or substance abuse
conditions.

Defendants may also be released on financial conditions. 
Financial conditions include (1) deposit bond (the defendant is
required to post a percentage of the total bail amount, usually
10%), (2) surety bond (the defendant is released subject to
guarantees by a third person that the full amount will be paid),
or (3) collateral bond (collateral equal to the full bail amount
required to be posted by the defendant before release). 
Financial conditions may occur in combination with nonfinancial
conditions.

Factors relating to release or 
detention

In deciding whether to release a defendant and in setting
release conditions, the court is directed to consider the nature
and circumstances of the offense charges, the weight of evidence
against the defendant, the defendant's character, physical and
mental condition, family ties, employment, financial resources,
length of residence in the community, community ties, past
conduct, history relating to drug or alcohol abuse, criminal
history, and record concerning appearance at court proceedings.

During 1998, 26,260 defendants were released for some period of
time prior to trial (table 3.1).  Those defendants released made
up 43% of the 60,950 defendants who terminated pretrial services
during 1998.  Of the defendants released, 84% completed pretrial
services without violating the conditions of their release
(table 3.8). 

In 1998, 40,669 defendants were detained for some period of time
prior to the disposition of their case (table 3.3).  Those
defendants detained comprised about 67% of all defendants who
terminated pretrial services during 1998.  Included are those
who were detained prior to having a preliminary hearing with the
magistrate, at which point they could have been either released
or ordered to have a detention hearing.  Of the defendants
detained, 55% were ordered detained by the court until case
disposition.

Pretrial detention hearings were held for 30,204 defendants.  Of
these, 22,143, or 73%, were ordered detained (table 3.5).

Of the 26,246 defendants released prior to trial, 16% violated a
condition of their release (table 3.7).  The majority (88%) of
these violations were technical violations of the bail
conditions.  Defendants released on deposit bond were more
likely (25%) than other defendants to incur some violation of
the conditions of their release (table 3.8).  Conversely,
defendants given conditional release violated their release at
the lowest rates (5%).  Five percent of all released defendants
had their release revoked.

Pretrial outcomes by offense 
categories

Releases (table 3.1) -- Defendants charged with property
offenses were more likely than other defendants to be released
prior to criminal trial; in 1998, 77% of the 13,463 property
offenders were released (figure 3.1).  However, the percent
released varied greatly across offense categories.  Among
violent offenders, 18% of those charged with robbery were
released compared to 55% of those charged with assault and 66%
of those charged with sex offenses other than rape.  Among
public order offenders, 8% of those charged with immigration
offenses were released compared to 95% of those charged with tax
law violations and 43% of those with weapons offenses.

Property defendants also made up the largest part of those
defendants who were released, while drug defendants made up the
largest part of those defendants who were detained.  Violent
defendants composed the smallest part of defendants in both
groups.

About 35% of all drug defendants were released.  Drug
trafficking defendants were less likely to be released than
those charged with nontrafficking offenses (33% compared to
53%), but defendants charged with trafficking offenses
outnumbered those charged with nontrafficking offenses by more
than 9 to 1.

The release types for those defendants who were released prior
to trial varied among offense categories (table 3.1).  Within
each major offense category, the highest percentage of
defendants released was on unsecured bond, except for violent
defendants.  Of the 32% of violent defendants released, 40% were
released on unsecured bond and 43% on personal recognizance
compared to 77% of all property defendants released, of whom 54%
were released on unsecured bond and 34% on personal recognizance.

Detentions (tables 3.3 and 3.5) -- Among the major offense
categories, defendants charged with drug offenses were the most
likely (80%) to be detained for some period of time (table 3.3,
figure 3.1).  Seventy-seven percent of defendants charged with
violent offenses were detained for some period of time.  But
violent defendants were more likely than drug offenders (62%
versus 55%) to be detained by the court.  Property and
public-order defendants were less likely to be detained than
were drug and violent defendants.  During 1998, 74% of
public-order defendants were detained.  Of public-order
defendants, those charged with immigration offenses were the
most likely to be detained (96%).  In 1998, 30% of defendants
charged with property offenses were detained.  Of those
defendants detained, 56% of public-order and 43% of property
defendants were detained by the court.

For 66% of defendants charged with violent offenses, it was
decided at the preliminary hearing that a detention hearing was
warranted (table 3.5, figure 3.2).  This rate varied by offense
category:  62% of those charged with drug-related offenses, 50%
of those charged with public-order offenses, and 22% of those
charged with property offenses were ordered to have a detention
hearing.  Of those charged with violent offenses, the most
likely to have a pretrial detention hearing were those charged
with kidnaping, robbery, threats against the President, or
murder.  The least likely to have a pretrial detention hearing
were those charged with sex offenses other than rape and those
charged with assault.

Once a defendant was ordered to have a detention hearing, the
chances of being detained were less variable across offense
categories (table 3.5).  The highest rate of defendants ordered
detained were those charged with public-order offenses (83%) --
primarily immigration (89%) and weapons offenders (70%).  Of the
66% of defendants charged with violent offenses and given a
pretrial detention hearing, 73% were ordered detained.  In 1998,
70% of those charged with drug offenses and 59% of those charged
with property offenses were ordered detained following a
pretrial hearing.

Violations (table 3.7) -- Of defendants released prior to trial
and terminating pretrial services during 1998, those charged
with drug offenses were more likely (27%) than other defendants
to incur at least one violation during the release period. 
Among major offense categories, those charged with property
offenses were less likely (11%) than others to violate
conditions of their release.  Those charged with drug offenses
and violent offenses were more likely to have their release
revoked (10% of all released drug defendants, 9% of all released
violent defendants), and public-order defendants were slightly
more likely than property defendants to have their release
revoked (4% versus 3%).

Pretrial outcomes across 
demographic groups

Releases (table 3.2) -- Females were more likely (68%) than
males (38%) to be released during 1998 (figure 3.3).  Males were
more likely to have a financial condition imposed on them as
females (17% versus 11%).  Fifty-eight percent of all defendants
identified as non-Hispanic were released during 1998 compared to
19% of Hispanics.  Non-Hispanic releasees had more than twice
the chance of being released on personal recognizance as
Hispanics.

The higher the education level of the defendant, the greater the
probability of release.  A third (34%) of defendants with less
than a high school education were released in 1998, while 75% of
those who had completed college were released.  Releasees with a
college degree were less likely to receive financial conditions
(13%) and more likely to be released on personal recognizance
(31%) than those who had less education.

Defendants with a history of drug abuse were released less
frequently than those defendants with no known drug history. 
However, among all released defendants, drug abuse history does
not appear to have had a major effect on the form of pretrial
release.

Detentions (tables 3.4 and 3.6) -- Males were more likely (71%
versus 44%) than females to be detained (table 3.4).  Of all
detainees, 56% of the men and 42% of the women were detained
following a detention hearing.  Hispanics had a substantially
higher probability of being detained (nearly 9 out of 10) as
compared with non-Hispanics (5 out of 10).  Higher detention
rates for Hispanics reflects a perceived greater risk of
pretrial flight.  In a previous BJS report, 70% of Hispanics
prosecuted in the Federal courts were identified as noncitizens
and 64% lived in the community in which they were arrested for
less than 1 year. (Federal Pretrial Release and Detention, BJS
Special Report, NCJ 168635.)  Additionally, almost all of those
charged with an immigration offense -- of which Hispanics
comprise the majority -- were detained because of the perceived
risk of pretrial flight.

Younger defendants were more likely than older ones to be
detained, with the percentage peaking at defendants in their
twenties.  Seventy-two percent of defendants between the ages of
21 and 30 years were detained compared to 70% of defendants
between 16 and 18 years and 48% of those over 40.  However,
among all defendants detained, the chances of being detained
following a detention hearing were similar across all age
groups.  These patterns were more dramatic with education
levels.  Those defendants with lower levels of education were
more likely to be detained.  Seventy-seven percent of those who
did not graduate from high school were detained versus 34% of
college graduates.  Of those detained, 54% of defendants without
a high school diploma were detained following a detention
hearing compared to 48% of college graduates.

Not only were male defendants nearly twice as likely as female
defendants to have a detention hearing (53% versus 31%), they
were also more likely to be ordered detained as a result of the
hearing (table 3.6).

The likelihood of having a detention hearing increased with the
number of prior convictions, severity of the defendant's
criminal history, and current sentence of supervision. 
Further-more, 55% of those with a history of drug abuse had
detention hearings as compared to 42% of those without such a
past.  Those with a history of drug abuse were slightly more
likely to be detained.

Violations (table 3.9) -- Released males were more likely than
females to incur a violation during the pretrial release period
(18% versus 13%) and were slightly more likely to have their
release revoked.  Blacks were more likely to incur a violation
than whites (21% versus 14%).  Defendants with no prior criminal
history were less likely to have a pretrial release violation
than those with a prior conviction.  Released defendants with a
known drug history had more than 3 times the likelihood of
incurring a violation than those with no known drug history. 
Also, those with a history of drug use were substantially more
likely to have their release revoked.

Length of pretrial detention 
(table 3.10) 

Among defendants detained for any time prior to case
disposition, those charged with drug offenses were detained the
longest (an average of 88.7 days) compared to violent defendants
(81.2 days), public-order defendants (62.5 days), and property
defendants (50.0 days) -- not in a table.

Of defendants released, those released on conditional means
spent the greatest average number of days detained (65.2 days)
compared to those released on personal recognizance (50.1 days),
unsecured bond (46.1 days), or  financial conditions (35.8
days).  This trend varied only slightly across all major offense
categories -- defendants released on conditional means were
detained more days than defendants who were released by any
other means.

Of defendants not released, those detained following a detention
hearing were detained longer, on average, than those held on
financial conditions (105.0 days compared with 77.4 days).  Only
public order defendants held on financial conditions (74.2 days)
were detained longer than those detained by the court (72.0
days).

Chapter notes

1)   All tables in chapter 3 were created from data in the
Pretrial Services Information Act System data base, which is
maintained by the Pretrial Services Agency (PSA) within the
AOUSC.  The data describe 60,950 defendants who terminated
pretrial services during October 1, 1997, through September 30,
1998, and whose cases were filed by complaint, indictment, or
information.  In these tables, the totals (e.g., "all offenses")
included records whose offense or other attributes were missing
or indeterminable.  The percentage distributions were based on
nonmissing values, and missing values were reported in a
separate row or in a footnote.

Offenses in the PSA are based on the most serious charged
offense, as determined by the probation officer responsible for
the interview with the defendant.  The probation officer
classifies the major offense charged into AOUSC four-digit
offense codes.  For defendants charged with more than one
offense on an indictment, the probation officer chooses as the
most major charged offense the one carrying the most severe
penalty or, in the case of two or more charges carrying the same
penalty, the one with the highest offense severity.  The offense
severity level is determined by the AOUSC, which ranks offenses
according to the maximum sentence, type of crime, and maximum
fine amount.  These four-digit codes are then aggregated into
the same offense categories as those used in chapter 2.

For drug offenses, the type of drug activity -- trafficking or
possession -- is obtained by the probation officers from their
reading of the indictment or other charging documents.  The
AOUSC citation manual provides probation officers with detailed
instructions on how to code drug crimes.

2)  In tables 3.13.4, the percentages showing the methods of
release or methods of detention were based on the number of
defendants released or the number of defendants detained.  In
tables 3.5 and 3.6, the percentages were based on the number of
defendants who had hearings and were ordered detained.  This
method departs from the 1993 and prior compendia, in which the
percentages were based on the number of defendants terminating
pretrial services.

Chapter 4

Adjudication

Federal criminal cases may result in conviction of the defendant
following plea or trial, acquittal of the defendants after
trial, or dismissal of the case.**(1Unless otherwise noted, data
describe felony and misdemeanor cases in U.S. district courts
and include Class A misdemeanors handled by U.S. magistrates. 
The data also include Class B misdemeanors that are handled by
U.S. district court judges, which occur infrequently.)** 

Defendants in cases commenced 
(table 4.1)  

During 1998, 78,172 defendants had criminal cases
commenced**(2Cases are commenced on or after the date that
charges are filed against defendants.)** against them in U.S.
district courts, and 64,769 (83%) of those defendants were
charged with felonies.  The 28,021 felony drug defendants
comprised 36% of all criminal defendants in cases filed and 43%
of all felony defendants.  Felony property and public-order
defendants comprised 19% and 23%, respectively, of all
defendants in cases filed.  The 13,254 misdemeanor defendants
constituted 17% of all defendants in cases filed, with 37% of
those misdemeanor defendants charged with traffic violations.

Defendants in cases terminated 
(table 4.2)

Cases were terminated against 69,769 defendants during 1998,
57,054 (82%) of whom were felony defendants.  During 1998, the
24,317 drug-related felony defendants comprised nearly 35% of
all defendants in cases terminated and 43% of all felony
defendants.

Over 87% of all defendants were convicted; 90% of all felony
defendants and 75% of misdemeanor defendants.  For major felony
offense categories, conviction rates hovered around the 90%
range.  Within major offense categories, however, the conviction
rates varied more widely.  For example, within the violent
offense category, the conviction rates ranged from 80% for those
found guilty of assault, to 96% for robbery.  Within the
public-order category, the conviction rate ranged from 66% for
civil rights violations to 95% for immigration and gambling
offenses.

Most defendants who were convicted pleaded guilty.  Overall,
over 93% of those convicted pleaded guilty, while only 6% were
convicted at trial. For felony offenses, 94% pleaded guilty to
their charges.  For the major felony offense categories, guilty
pleas were registered for 92% of violent offend-ers, 93% of drug
offenders, and 95% each for public-order and property offenders.

During 1998, 4,882 defendants exercised their right to a trial. 
A higher percentage of violent offenders went to trial than
drug, property, and public-order offenders.  Ten percent of
violent offenders went to trial as compared with 6% of both
property and public-order offenders, and 7% of drug offenders.

Of defendants who exercised their right to a trial, 3,692 (76%)
were convicted either by a jury or a bench trial.  The felony
trial conviction rate was 83%, while the misdemeanor conviction
rate was 50%.  Among felony offenses, trial conviction rates
ranged from 79% for violent defendants to 86% for drug
defendants.  Property and public-order offenders fell in
between, as 80% were convicted at trial for each respectively.

Case processing times 
(table 4.3)

The data in table 4.3 cover the inter-val from the time a case
is filed in U.S. district court through sentencing for those
convicted as well as the interval from case filing through
disposition for those not convicted, or those whose cases are
dismissed.  Title I of the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, as amended,
sets time requirements for processing criminal cases in Federal
courts.  Except for certain exclusions, indictment must occur
within 30 days of arrest; defendants are guaranteed at least 30
days to prepare for trial; and the Government must be ready for
trial within 70 days.  The Speedy Trial Act does not specify a
time interval from trial to sentencing,**(3The sentencing reform
Act of 1984 specifies minimum intervals for the disclosure and
objections to the presentnce report.  See rule 31, Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure)** and the time limits set by the
Act exclude several enumerated periods of pretrial procedure
such as time spent awaiting rulings on motions.**(418 U.S.C.
3161 et. seq.)**  Additionally, defendants may waive their
rights within the Speedy Trial Act.  As a result, the actual
processing time for most defendants can be longer than the
statutory limits without violating the provisions of the Act.

Overall, the average time for processing defendants was 8.7
months (figure 4.1).  For felony defendants, the overall
processing time average was 9.7 months; for those charged with
misdemeanor crimes, the average processing time was 3.9 months. 
Defendants who pleaded guilty were processed faster (7.9 months)
on average, than defendants who went to trial (11.6 months). 
Overall, defendants whose cases were ultimately dismissed took
longest to process (12.7 months), on average.  Among major
felony offense categories, however, case processing times were
not similar to the overall pattern.  Only those convicted of
drug offenses took a greater amount of time for dismiss-al, on
average, than those who went to trial.

Convictions by U.S. Magistrates 
(table 4.4)

During 1998 U.S. magistrates disposed of 11,685 misdemeanor
criminal defendants, almost 75% of whom were convicted.  Traffic
violators comprised 42% of the defendants disposed by U.S.
magistrates, with property offenders comprising another 32%. 
Drug offenses comprised almost 10% of U.S. magistrates' cases.

Characteristics of convicted defendants 
(table 4.5)

Among defendants convicted, there were over 5 times as many men
as women (85% versus 15%); over twice as many whites as blacks
(67% versus 28%); and almost twice as many non-Hispanics as
Hispanics (63% versus 37%).  Most were U.S. citizens (67%), had
graduated from high school or completed some higher education
(57%), and had some criminal history (54%).  Persons over the
age of 30 represented 55% of defendants.

Chapter notes

1)  Tables 4.1-4.4 were derived from the Administrative Office of
U.S. Courts (AOUSC) criminal master data files.  Only records
with cases filed in U.S. district court (table 4.1) or cases
that terminated in U.S. district court during October 1, 1997,
through September 30, 1998, were selected.  Offenses were
classified according to the most serious offense charged.  In
the case of multiple offenses, the offense carrying the most
severe potential penalty was selected.

In this Compendium, carjacking offenses are classified as
robberies, based on title and section of the U.S. Code.  In
compendia prior to the 1997 Compendium, they were classified as
motor vehicle thefts, based on the AOUSC offense classifications.

2)  Table 4.5 was created by matching the AOUSC master data files
with the U.S. Sentencing Commission (USSC) monitoring system
files and the Pretrial Services Agency (PSA) data files.  These
latter two data files contain information on the characteristics
of defendants.  The USSC monitoring system files are limited to
records of defendants sentenced under the Federal sentencing
guidelines only.  These include defendants convicted of felonies
or Class A misdemeanors.  Excluded from the USSC data were
defendants convicted only of Class B or C misdemeanors or
infractions, defendants whose offenses were committed before
November 1, 1987, and juvenile offenders.  Juveniles are not
subject to guidelines, and they were not included in table 4.5. 
Some of the defendants excluded from the USSC data files were
included in the PSA data.  (See Chapter 3 Chapter notes for more
information on the PSA data.)  Table 4.5 indicates the number of
records for which relevant data were available.  Percentage
distributions were based on records with known values of
defendant characteristics and offenses.

3)  A criminal record, as reported in table 4.5, is limited to
prior adult convictions.  For some defendants in this table, it
is further limited to the portion that is relevant for
calculating sentences under the Federal sentencing guidelines. 
In general, this is limited to sentences imposed within a
15-year period prior to the current offense and offenses
committed within the United States.  For most defendants, the
criminal history used to calculate sentencing guideline ranges
includes their entire adult criminal history.

Chapter 5

Sentencing

Depending upon the type and severity of the offense, convicted
offenders may be sentenced to incarceration, probation, a fine,
or a combination of sanctions such as a split or mixed sentence
(imprisonment as well as a period of probation supervision). 
(For a definition of mixed sentences, see Glossary, p. 111.) 
The Federal sentencing guidelines require a term of supervised
release following service of any prison sentence of more than 1
year.  In addition, courts have the discretion to impose
supervised release in any other case.

Except where otherwise indicated, tables in this chapter are
based on the most serious offense of conviction.  They are not
directly comparable with tables in earlier chapters that are
based on the most serious offense investigated or most serious
offense charged (see "Offense classifications" in Methodology,
p. 107).

Offenders convicted and sentences imposed 
(table 5.1)

Of the 60,958 offenders sentenced during 1998, 43,041 (71%) were
sentenced to prison; 12,744 (21%) were sentenced to probation;
and 3,199 (5%) were ordered to pay only a fine.  (Offenders
given an intermediate sanction such as intermittent confinement
or community confinement that also included probation
supervision are counted among offenders given probation.)  Of
the 43,041 offenders sentenced to prison, 41,420 (96%) were
convicted of felonies, and 82% of convicted felons were
sentenced to prison.  Defendants convicted of drug (92%) and
violent (91%) felonies were more likely to receive prison
sentences than were defendants convicted of property (60%) or
public-order (83%) offenses (figure 5.1).

Among public-order offenders, persons convicted of weapons
(92%), immigration offenses (91%), and escape (91%) were as
likely as violent and drug offenders to receive prison sentences.

Among property offenders, persons convicted of arson or the use
of explosives (87%) were also almost as likely as violent and
drug offenders to receive prison sentences.

Overall, 21% of convicted offenders were sentenced to probation.
The percentage of misdemeanants sentenced to probation (48%)
was three times that of convicted felons (15%).  Among felons,
persons convicted of communication violations (86%), postal law
violations (84%), and agriculture violations (68%) were the most
likely to be given probation.

While less than 1% of all convicted felons were ordered to only
pay a fine, 45% of the felons convicted of antitrust violations
were so ordered.  Fines generally were reserved for misdemeanor
offenders, 28% of whom received fines.

Average prison sentences imposed 
(table 5.2)

For all offenders given prison terms, the average term of
imprisonment imposed was 58.8 months.  Persons convicted of
felonies received an average prison term of 60.6 months.

The average length of prison sentence imposed varied among major
offense categories (figure 5.2).  Property offenders received
the shortest sentence, on average, while violent offenders
received the longest (25.4 months compared to 84.2 months). 
Drug offenders received 78.8 months, on average, and
public-order offenders received 47.3 months.  The average prison
term for public-order offenders was primarily attributable to
sentences imposed for weapons offenders.  The 2,914 weapons
offenders sentenced to prison comprised 24% of the 12,218
public-order offenders sent to prison; weapons offenders
received an average prison term of 100.6 months, and
public-order offenders other than weapons offenders received an
average prison term of 30.6 months.

Relationship between sentence imposed and mode of  
conviction (table 5.3)

Offenders convicted by plea were less likely to receive prison
sentences than those convicted at trial.  Seventy percent of the
offenders convicted by guilty plea received some prison time,
while 84% of the offenders convicted at trial received prison
sentences.

For violent offenders, 91% of those convicted by plea received
prison sentences, as did 97% of those convicted at trial.  For
fraudulent property offenders, 59% of those convicted by plea
received prison sentences, compared to 86% of those convicted at
trial. And, for regulatory public-order offenders, 41% of those
convicted by plea went to prison, but 70% of those convicted at
trial did.

The average prison term imposed on defendants convicted at trial
was longer than the term imposed on defendants convicted by
plea.  Defendants convicted at trial received 148.9 months, on
average, while those convicted by plea received an average of
52.3 months (figure 5.3).  Drug offenders convicted at trial
received an average of 188.4 months as compared to the 71 months
for drug offenders convicted by a guilty plea. Violent offenders
who went to trial received an average sentence of 180.4 months
as compared to the 75.8 months for those convicted by plea.

Characteristics of offenders sentenced to prison 
(tables 5.4-5.6)

The majority of persons sentenced to prison during 1998 were
male(85%), white (67%), non-Hispanic (63%), and U.S. citizens
(67%). The percentage sentenced to prison was not uniform across
all categories of age, race, sex, education, and ethnicity. 
Similarly, the average sentences imposed were not uniform across
these categories (table 5.5).  However, conclusions about the
effect that characteristics may have had on sentencing cannot be
drawn from the aggregate patterns in the data.  Such an
assessment would require detailed information for each category
showing the presence or absence of factors that are legally
intended to affect sentencing, such as offense severity, weapon
use, role in the offense, victim injury, dollar loss, and so
forth.

One such study of the factors affecting sentencing found that
"nearly all of the aggregate differences among sentences for
whites, blacks, and Hispanics during 1989-90 can be attributed
to characteristics of offenses and offenders that current law
and sentencing guidelines establish as legitimate considerations
in sentencing decisions." **(* Douglas C. McDonald and Kenneth
E. Carlson, Sentencing in the Federal Courts: Does Race Matter? 
Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice
Statistics, December 1993 (NCJ145328).)**

Average sentences imposed were longest for males (61.8 months),
blacks (90.2 months), non-Hispanics (69.1 months), and U.S.
citizens (68.8 months).  These longer terms were due in large
part because these categories of offenders (males, blacks,
non-Hispanics, and U.S. citizens) are more highly concentrated
in the offense types (table 5.4) that also are associated with
longer average sentences (table 5.2).  For example,
incarceration rates for blacks exceeded those of whites in the
violent, drug, and nonregulatory public-order offense
categories.  These offenses are associated with longer average
sentences (table 5.2, figure 5.2) than are property offenses or
misdemeanors -- the categories in which whites' incarceration
rates exceeded those of blacks.  In general, within categories
of offender characteristics, average prison terms were longer
for violent and drug offenses than for property and regulatory
public-order offenses. These two offense categories generally
are considered to be more serious under the Federal sentencing
guidelines than are property and regulatory public-order
offenses.  As a result, for aggregate tables like the ones
presented in this chapter, persons with a certain characteristic
may appear to receive more severe sentences on average.  The
primary reason for the larger averages is the larger number of
serious offenses that made up the average sentences.

Chapter notes

1)  Tables 5.1-5.3 were derived from the AOUSC criminal master
data files.  Only records of defendants sentenced during October
1, 1997, through September 30, 1998, were selected.  Offenses
shown in these tables -- offenses of conviction -- are based on
the longest actual sentence imposed.

2)  Tables 5.4-5.6 were created from AOUSC criminal master data
files, supplemented with linked data on offender characteristics
from two sources: the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC)
monitoring system files (which are limited to records of
defendants sentenced under the Federal sentencing guidelines);
and the Pretrial Services Information Act System database,
maintained by the Pretrial Services Agency (PSA).  These two
supplemental data files contain information on the
characteristics of defendants.  Table 5.4 indicates the number
of records for which relevant data were available.  Percentage
distributions were based on records with known values of
defendant characteristics and offenses.  Means and medians in
tables 5.5 and 5.6 were based on the number of records shown in
table 5.4.

3)  Criminal record, as reported in tables 5.4-5.6, is limited
to prior adult convictions.  For some defendants in these
tables, it is further limited to the portion of their criminal
record that is relevant for calculating sentences under the
Federal sentencing guidelines.  In general, this is limited to
sentences imposed within 15 years of the current offense and
sentences for offenses committed within the United States.  For
most defendants, the criminal history used to calculate
sentencing guideline ranges is the same as their adult criminal
history.

Chapter 6

Appeals


Prior to implementation of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,
only criminal convictions could be appealed.  However, the
Sentencing Reform Act provided for the appellate review of
sentences imposed given that the sentence was (1) imposed in
violation of the law; (2) imposed as the result of an incorrect
sentencing guideline application; (3) outside the recommended
guideline sentencing range; or (4) imposed for an offense for
which no sentencing guideline exists and is plainly
unreasonable.  Both the defendant and the Government have the
right to appeal an imposed sentence (18 U.S.C. § 3742).

Appeals filed (tables 6.1 and 6.2)

During 1998 the U.S. Court of Appeals received 10,535 criminal
appeals.  Of all appeals, 4% were filed by the Government (not
shown in a table).

Forty-seven percent of appeals filed in 1998 challenged both the
conviction and the sentence imposed. Twice as many appeals
challenged only the sentence imposed as those that challenged
only the conviction (24% versus 12%).  Fifteen percent of
appeals filed were appeals of convictions for crimes committed
before 1987, when the sentencing guidelines took effect (figure
6.1).

The distribution of appeals by type of appeal filed (sentence,
conviction, or both) was relatively similar across the major
offense categories underlying the appeal.  However, 56% of
appeals filed for immigration offenses appealed both the
sentence and the conviction, compared to 48% for public-order
offenses and 47% for all criminal categories. 

Nearly half of all appeals filed were for drug convictions
(48%).  Appeals for public-order convictions comprised 25% of
all appeals filed, property offenses comprised 19%, and the
remaining 7% of appeals filed were for violent offenses (figure
6.2).

Appeals terminated (tables 6.3-6.5)

A total of 10,105 appeals terminated during 1998.  Of these, 47%
were appeals of both the sentence and conviction, 24% were
appeals of the sentence only, and 14% were appeals of the
conviction only.  Fourteen percent were appeals of convictions
for offenses sentenced under laws in effect prior to the
sentencing guidelines.

In nearly half of all appeals terminated in 1998, drug offense
convictions underlie the appeal (46%); the under- lying offense
in 24% of the appeals was a public-order offense; 19% were
property offense appeals; and 7% were appeals for violent
offense convictions.  For 43% of public-order appeals, the
underlying offense of conviction was for weapons.  Robbery
offenses composed 42% and murder composed 16% of the underlying
offenses for appeals of a violent conviction.  Sixty-two percent
of property offense appeals were for fraud convictions.

Of the 10,105 appeals terminated during 1998, 76% were
terminated on the merits, while the remainder were terminated on
procedural grounds (figure 6.3).  For appeals based on a
conviction of a drug offense or a public-order offense, 78% were
terminated on the merits.  Also terminated on the merits were
79% of appeals based on a violent conviction and 72% of appeals
based on a property conviction.  Within these major offense
categories, the appeals having the highest rates of termination
on the merits were those based on a conviction for a weapons
offense (83%), a rape or a murder conviction (81%), or a
conviction for racketeering and extortion (80%).

In 82% of appeals terminated on the merits, the district court
ruling was affirmed.  In another 4% it was partially affirmed. 
Eighty-three percent of all drug offense appeals were affirmed,
as were 80% of violent offense appeals and property appeals. 
Eighty-two percent of public-order offense appeals were affirmed.

District court decisions were reversed or remanded back to the
court in 8% of the cases.  Violent offenses had the highest rate
of reversal or being remanded back to the court (12%).  Nine
percent of property offense appeals were reversed or remanded,
as were 8% of public-order and 7% of drug offense appeals.

Overall, appeals were dismissed in 5% of cases.  Across major
offense categories, this dismissal rate remained relatively
constant.

Chapter notes

Tables in chapter 6 were created from the AOUSC appeals
database.  Records of appeals filed or terminated during October
1, 1997, through September 30, 1998, were selected.  Data
include records of 10,535 criminal appeals filed during fiscal
year 1998 and 10,105 appeals terminated during the same period.

The unit of analysis in the appeals data is a single case.  Most
records in the appeals data report on a single appellant. 
Appeals were classified into the offense categories that
represent the underlying offense of conviction.  Offenses
represent the statutory offense charged against a defendant in a
criminal appeal.  Offenses were classified by the AOUSC into
their four digit offense codes.  These were then aggregated into
the offense categories shown in the tables.

Chapter 7

Corrections


Federal offenders under 
supervision (table 7.1)

As of the end of the fiscal year 1998, there were 92,768
offenders under active Federal supervision, of which most (88%)
were felons.  About 65% of these offenders were receiving one of
two forms of post-incarceration supervision:  supervised release
(54,822) or parole (5,827).  The remainder (32,119) were under
probation supervision.  Most of the probationer population had
been convicted of either a property felony (38%) or some type of
misdemeanor offense (33%).  Nearly 53% of offenders under
supervised release and over 52% of parolees had been convicted
of a drug offense.

Outcomes of offenders completing 
supervision (tables 7.3, 7.5, and 
7.7)

Probation (table 7.3) -- During 1998, 16,011 offenders completed
one or more terms of active probation.  Overall, 81% of
offenders successfully completed their term of probation,
another 17% violated their conditions of probation, and the
remaining 2% were administrative closures.  Of offenders
terminating probation, 5% committed a new crime (figure 7.1). 
Most committed technical violations, including drug use (4%) and
absconding (2%).

Offenders convicted of violent offenses were less likely than
others to successfully complete a term of probation without a
violation (figure 7.2).  During 1998, 30% of probationers
convicted of violent offenses violated their conditions of
probation, as did 16% of drug, 14% of property, and 9% of
public-order offenders.  Violent offenders were also more likely
to commit new crimes (9%) than were probationers convicted of
property (4%), drug (5%), and public-order (4%) offenses.

Supervised release (table 7.5) -- During 1998, 19,878 offenders
completed terms of supervised release.  Overall, 64% of them
successfully completed their term of supervised release; 21%
committed technical violations, such as drug use (8%) and
absconding (4%); and 12% of these offenders violated their
probation supervision by committing a new crime.  The remaining
3% had their supervision administratively terminated.

Violent offenders were less likely than others to complete a
term of supervised release without a violation.  Fifty-four
percent of violent offenders violated conditions of supervised
release, while 32% of drug, 32% of public-order, and 28% of
property offenders violated supervised release.  Violent
offenders were also more likely to commit new crimes (18%) than
offenders convicted of property (10%), drug (12%), or
public-order (13%) offenses.

Parole (table 7.7) -- During 1998, 3,077 offenders completed
terms of parole.  Overall, 56% of these offenders successfully
completed their term of parole.  During 1998, 13% of these
offenders violated their supervision by committing a new crime;
26% committed technical violations, such as drug use (12%) and
absconding (5%); and 5% completed their parole term through an
administrative case closure.

Offenders convicted of violent offenses were less likely than
others to complete a term of parole without a violation. 
Sixty-two percent of violent offenders violated conditions of
parole, while 35% of public-order, and 33% of property and 29%
of drug offenders violated parole.  Violent offenders were also
more likely to commit new crimes (20%) than offenders convicted
of property (14%), public order (12%), or drug (10%) offenses.   

Characteristics of offenders 
completing supervision 
(tables 7.4, 7.6, and 7.8)

Probation (table 7.4) -- Among offenders who completed a term of
probation, 74% were male; 68% were white and 88% were of
non-Hispanic origin; 25% were less than age 31 (compared to 53%
over age 40); 25% had less than a high school diploma (compared
to 38% whose highest education was a high school diploma and 37%
who had at least some college education); and 80% had no known
drug history.

Younger offenders, those with a history of drug abuse, and those
with a lower educational background had higher probabilities of
violating the conditions of probation.  Offenders ages 16 to 20
were more likely (41%) to violate conditions of supervision than
probationers in other age groups -- 25% of those ages 21 to 30
and 13% of those over age 30. 

Probationers with a history of drug abuse were almost 9 times
more likely to violate probation for drug use than offenders who
were not drug abusers.  Probationers with known histories of
drug abuse were also more likely to violate supervision for
other reasons (fugitive status and new crimes) than were other
probationers.

Probationers with lower levels of education were more likely to
violate the conditions of probation than those with higher
levels of education.  Those who did not graduate high school had
a 25% violation rate, those who were high school graduates had a
17% violation rate, those with some college had a 13% violation
rate, and those with a college degree had only a 5% violation
rate.

Supervised release (table 7.6) -- Among those who completed a
term of supervised release, 85% were male; 66% were white; 83%
were of non-Hispanic origin; 20% were less than age 31 (52% were
over age 40);  37% had only some high school (34% had a high
school diploma and 28% had at least some college); and 56% had
no known drug history.


Younger offenders, those with a history of drug abuse, and those
with a lower educational background had higher probabilities of
violating the conditions of supervised release.  Offenders under
age 30 were more likely to violate conditions of their
supervision than offenders in other age groups -- 46% of those
under age 30 violated a condition of their supervision compared
to 23% of those over age 40.

Releasees with a history of drug abuse were 4 times more likely
to terminate their supervision for technical violations of drug
use as were releasees who were not drug abusers.  Releasees with
known histories of drug abuse were also more likely to violate
supervision with technical violations or new crimes.

Similarly, releasees with lower levels of education were more
likely to violate conditions of  supervised release than those
with higher levels of education.  Those who did not graduate
from high school had a 41% violation rate, those who were high
school graduates had a 33% violation rate, those with some
college had a 25% violation rate, and those with a college
degree had a 12% violation rate.

Parole (table 7.8) -- Among those who completed a term of
parole, 96% were male; 63% were white; 86% were of non-Hispanic
origin; 79% were over age 40; 43% had only some high school (33%
had a high school diploma and 18% had at least some college);
and 48% had no known drug history.

Offenders with a history of drug abuse and those with a lower
educational background had higher probabilities of violating the
conditions of parole.  Releasees with a history of drug abuse
were three times more likely to terminate their supervision for
technical violations of drug use than were releasees who were
not drug abusers.  Releasees with known histories of drug abuse
were also more likely to violate supervision with technical
violations or new crimes.

Similarly, releasees with lower levels of education were more
likely to violate conditions of  supervised release than those
with higher levels of education.  Those who did not graduate
from high school had a 45% violation rate, those who were high
school graduates had a 42% violation rate, those with some
college had a 28% violation rate, and those with a college
degree had a 15% violation rate.

Admissions, releases, and 
standing population of Federal
prisoners (table 7.9)

The Federal prison population grew by 9,670 persons during
fiscal year 1998, increasing from 99,255 sentenced prisoners to
108,925.  The greatest growth was among drug and public-order
offenders, particularly immigration offenders.  The number of
drug offenders in prison grew by 4,847 in 1998.  The number of
immigration offenders increased by 1,970.  In contrast, the
number of weapons offenders grew at a slower rate, increasing by
680. Violent offenders increased by 815 offenders.

Federal prisoners: First releases 
and time served (tables 7.12-7.14)

During 1998, 34,504 prisoners were released from Federal prison
for the first time after serving a sentence imposed by a U.S.
district court.  **(1Tables 7.12-7.14 include only prisoners
first released by the BOP during 1988.)**  Of these, 31,200 were
released by standard means.  These standard releases served an
average of 28.0 months (table 7.12) in prison -- 91% of the
sentence imposed, on average (table 7.14).**(2Average time to
first release is the number of months in Bureau of Prison
facilities.  Time to first release does not include time
detained pending adjudication and/or sentencing.  Percent of
total sentence obligation served until first release.)** 

The remaining 3,304 first releases were released by
extraordinary means:  2,085 were released early due to
participation in a drug treatment program; 223 had their
sentences commuted; 400 were de-ported; 205 died; and 391 were
released for other reasons including escape and an intensive
confinement program (table 7.12).  Drug offenders made up the
vast majority of those released by extraordinary means (81%).

Time served until first release varied by offense:  Violent
offenders served an average of 53.7 months; drug offenders
served an average of 41.4 months; public-order offenders served
an average of 18.1 months; and property offenders served an
average of 15.5 months (figure 7.4).  During 1998 the average
time to first release for public-order offenders was influenced
heavily by the relatively short time served by immigration
offenders.  Immigration offenders composed 61% of all released
public-order offenders and, on average, served 11.1 months until
first release.  This was only half of the average time served
for all public-order offenders (18.1 months).  Exclusive of
immigration offenders, public-order offenders served an average
of 28.9 months until first release (not shown in a table).

While violent and drug offenders served more time before first
release, property and public-order offenders served more of
their sentences than violent and drug offenders (figure 7.4).

Old law offenders -- those who committed crimes before the
implementation of Federal Sentencing Guidelines in November 1987
-- that were released in 1998 are not shown separately in any
table.  Only 3%, or 996, of released offenders were old law
offenders.  New law offenders released during 1998 served, on
average, 26.3 months in prison (92% of the sentence imposed). 
Since the guidelines became effective as of November 1987, new
law offenders sentenced to terms of imprisonment greater than
149 months could not have been released by standard means as of
the end of  fiscal year 1998.***Footnote 3: The Federal Sentencing
Guidelines allow a prisoner up to 54 days per year for good
behavior, so a prisoner sentenced to 149 months in prison in
November 1987 could have served 127 months of his or her
sentence and been released in 1998.)***  They could have been
released for extraordinary reasons such as death, commutation,
or treaty transfer. ***Footnote 4: Prisoners released for extraordinary
reasons have been excluded from all time served and percent of
sentence served calculations.*** 

Characteristics of Federal 
prisoners (tables 7.10, 7.15, and 
7.16)

Standing population (table 7.10) -- Of prisoners in Federal
prison at the end of 1998, 93% were male, 57% were white, 40%
were black, 28% were Hispanic, and 74% were U.S. citizens. 
Fifty-seven percent of the yearend population were 31 years of
age or older.  This portrait of the Federal prison population
was similar across offenses and for new law offenders, except
for the ethnicity and citizenship of violent and property
offenders.  More than 88% of these offenders were non-Hispanic
and U.S. citizens.

Prisoners released (table 7.15) -- Of prisoners released during
1998, 88% were male, 73% were white, 24% were black, 40% were
Hispanic, and 61% were U.S. citizens.  Fifty-five percent were
31 years of age or older at the time they were committed to
Federal prison.  These patterns were similar across offenses and
for new law offenders, except for nonregulatory public-order
offenses.  Of released offenders convicted of those offenses,
64% were Hispanic and 66% were not U.S. citizens.

Time served to first release (table 7.16)-- Of prisoners
released by standard methods, males served more time than
females, blacks served more time than whites, non-Hispanics
served more time than Hispanics, older persons served more time
than younger (until over age 40), and U.S. citizens served more
time than noncitizens (figure 7.5).  However, among the
offenses, the overall pattern does not apply.  For example,
blacks served more time on average than whites, but among
property offenders released from prison, whites served more time
than blacks.


Chapter  Notes 

1) Offenders were classified according to their most serious
offense at conviction.  In cases involving multiple offenses,
the AOUSC offense severity hierarchy was applied.  The most
serious offense was the one with the most severe penalty
imposed.  If equal prison terms were imposed, or there was no
imprisonment, the offense with the highest severity code, as
determined by the U.S. Title and Code Criminal Offense Citations
Manual, was selected.

2) Tables 7.1 and 7.2 were created using the probation, parole,
and supervision data files of the Federal Probations Supervision
Information System (FPSIS), which is maintained by the AOUSC. 
Yearend pending cases (that is, records with offenders who were
under active supervision as of the end of the fiscal year,
September 30, 1998) were selected.

Corporate defendants were excluded from table 7.1.

3)	Tables 7.3-7.8 were created using the FPSIS data files as
well.  Only records with one or more terminations of active
supervision during October 1, 1997, through September 30, 1998,
were selected.  Each termination was counted separately. 
Technical violations and terminations for new crimes are shown
only if supervision terminated with incarceration or removal
from active supervision for reasons of a violation.

Corporate defendants were excluded from tables 7.3-7.8.

4) Table 7.9-7.16 were created from the Federal Bureau of
Prisons (BOP) data files.

Tables 7.9 and 7.10 show sentenced prisoners in the custody of
the BOP at the end of fiscal year 1998.  Tables  7.11-7.16
include only prisoners committed by U.S. district courts or
released by the BOP during fiscal year 1998.

In these tables, a single person may be counted more than once
if that person was committed into, or released from, the BOP
more than one time during fiscal year 1998, or if that person
appears in more than one column in a table, e.g., commitment and
population.

Offense categories in these tables were based on combinations of
offense designations used by the BOP.  They are similar, but may
not be directly comparable, to the categories used in other
tables of this Compendium.  Offenses for some prisoners admitted
or released were not able to be classified; these offenders were
included in the totals and are shown as "other prisoners" on the
last line of tables.

In these tables, offenses were classified according to the
offense associated with the longest single sentence actually
imposed.  Classifications in other tables may have been based on
the longest potential sentence allowed by law.

5) Tables 7.9-7.16 distinguish between prisoners committed by
U.S. district courts for violations of the U.S. Code and other
prisoners.  Prisoners released after commitment from U.S.
district court are called "first releases."  The other
admissions and releases include offenders who returned to prison
after their first release (such as probation, parole, or
supervised release violators), offenders convicted in other
courts (such as military or District of Columbia courts), and
persons admitted to prison as material witnesses or for purposes
of treatment, examination, or transfer to another authority. 
Offenders who entered or left a prison temporarily  such as for
transit to another location, for health care, or to serve a
weekend sentence  were not counted as admitted or released. 
Persons who were detained for deportation by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and who were not criminal offenders were
also not included in the tables.

Table 7.11 distinguishes between standard and extraordinary
methods of release from prison.  "Standard" releases include the
usual methods of exiting from prison, such as full-term sentence
expirations, expirations with good time, mandatory releases, and
releases to parole.  Extraordinary releases are unusual exits
from prison, such as death, commutation, and transfer to another
facility.

6)  Tables 7.11-7.16 include only prisoners committed by U.S.
district courts and released by the BOP during fiscal year 1998.
 Prisoners committed by U.S. district court   but not for a
violation of the U.S. Code, or whose offense could not be
classified  were included in the total but are not shown
separately.  Table 7.9, however, shows these prisoners
separately.  Other prisoners  such as probation and parole
violators and prisoners committed by other courts, such as
courts martial or District of Columbia Superior Court  were
excluded from tables 7.11-7.16, as were other persons admitted
to Federal prison but not committed from a U.S. district court.

7) In tables 7.11-7.16, time served was calculated for
prisoner's arrival into jurisdiction of the BOP until first
release from prison, plus any jail time served and credited. 
The calculation is the same as that currently used by the BOP. 
Prisoners serving consecutive sentences may have total imposed
sentences exceeding the longest single sentence length. 
Accordingly, time actually served may exceed the longest single
imposed sentence.  The percent of sentenced served (in tables
7.12 and 7.14) is the average of each individual prisoner's
percent of sentence served.  Because other publications may
include different groups of prisoners, calculate time served
differently, or use a different offense classification, data in
tables in this Compendium may differ from estimates of time
served in previous publications by the BOP or in publications
based on other data sources.

Time served, as reported in tables 7.11-7.16 in this Compendium,
may not be directly comparable to the calculation of time served
in the 1993 and prior compendia.  The methodology in this report
uses additional information to identify prison commitment dates
and account for jail credit.  In previous reports, jail credits
were overestimated in some cases.  In addition, time served
estimates reported in tables 7.12-7.14 and 7.16 include only
prisoners released by standard methods (expirations, mandatory
releases, and releases to parole).  Prisoners released by
extraordinary means (death, commutation, transfer, etc.) are
excluded from the time served calculations in these tables.

8) Table 7.9 shows all persons admitted to, or released from,
the jurisdiction of the BOP during fiscal year 1998.  Prisoners
counted in this column are the same as prisoners included in
tables 7.11, 7.12, and 7.13.  Table 7.9 shows in separate
columns, as well as in the total, prisoners committed by a U.S.
district court  but not for a violation of the U.S. code, or
whose offense could not be classified.  Other columns in table
7.9 include prisoners who were committed by other courts,
returned to prison for violation of the conditions of
supervision, or were received for examination, treatment, or
transfer to another jurisdiction.  Offenders who returned to
prison for a violation of the conditions of supervision without
a new court commitment, were classified according to the offense
with the longest single sentence originally imposed at
conviction.


Methodology

The Federal justice database

Source of data

The source of data for all tables in this Compendium is the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) Federal justice database. 
The database is presently constructed from source files provided
by the U.S. Marshals Service, the Executive Office for U.S.
Attorneys, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the
United States Sentencing Commission, and the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons.  The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts also
maintains the data collected by the Pretrial Services Agency,
the U.S. Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Probation Service. 
Federal law prohibits the use of these files for any purposes
other than research or statistics.  A description of the source
agency data files is provided in the table at the end of this
section.

Some records in the Federal justice database are matched
according to a statistically weighted combination of names,
other personal identifiers, dates of court appearances, types of
offenses, and other relevant information contained in the files.
Using the matched data files, it is possible to combine
information about two or more stages of the processing of a
criminal matter or case, for example from adjudication to
probation or parole supervision.

Reporting period

Wherever possible, matters or cases have been selected according
to some event which occurred during fiscal year 1998 (October 1,
1997, through September 30, 1998).  Some data files provided by
source agencies are organized according to a calendar year time
frame; these have been combined and divided into fiscal years
for purposes of the Compendium.  Files which are organized by
their source agencies according to fiscal year nonetheless
include some pertinent records in later years' files.  For
example, tabulations of suspects in matters concluded during
fiscal year 1998 in this Compendium have been assembled from
source files containing records of 1998 matters concluded which
were entered into the data system during fiscal years 1998 or
1999.

Availability of data items

The availability of particular items of information is affected
by the data source.  For example, data on prosecutors' decisions
prior to court filing are provided for cases investigated by
U.S. attorneys but not for those handled by other litigating
divisions of the U.S. Department of Justice.  Criminal Division
cases enter the data base once they are filed in U.S. district
court, however.  

Many items of social and demographic information come from
presentence investigation records, supervision records, or
sentencing records, and are available only for arrested
defendants who were convicted and/or began serving a sentence
involving supervised release.  This particularly affects sex,
race, ethnicity, and prior record information.

Table construction and interpretation

The tables presented report events that occurred during the
Federal fiscal year  October 1, 1997 - September 30, 1998. 
Generally, the tables include both individual and organizational
defendants.  Organizational defendants are not included in
tables describing pretrial release and detention or tables
showing defendants sentenced to incarceration.  Juvenile
offenders are included in the reported statistics.

Unit of analysis

The unit of analysis in chapters 1 through 6 is a combination of
a person (or corporation) and a matter or case.  For example, if
a single person is involved in three different criminal cases
during the time period specified in the table, he or she is
counted three times in the tabulation.  Similarly, if a single
criminal case involves a corporate defendant and four individual
defendants, it counts five times in the tabulation.  In chapter
7, the unit of analysis for incarceration, probation, parole, or
other supervised release is a person entering custody or
supervision, or a person leaving custody or supervision.  For
example, a person convicted in two concurrent cases and
committed once to the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons
in the indicated time period is counted as one admission to a
term of incarceration.  A person who terminates probation twice
in the indicated time period, such as with a violation and again
after reinstatement, is counted as two terminations of probation.

Interpretation

The tables in the Compendium are constructed to permit the user
to make valid comparisons of numbers within each table and to
compare percentage rates across tables.  The total numbers of
subjects in Compendium tables that are based on records linked
between two files are generally less than the total number of
records in either source file.  Accordingly, comparisons of
absolute numbers across two or more tables in this volume and
other data sources are not necessarily valid.

Offense classifications

Procedure

The offense classification procedure used in this Compendium is
based on the classification system followed by the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.  Specific offenses
combined to form the BJS categories shown in the Compendium
tables.*(These categories correspond to the Bureau of Justice
Statistics crime definitions and, to the extent possible, are
organized and presented consistent with BJS publications on
State criminal justice systems.)

Offense categories for Federal arrestees in chapter 1 are based
on the FBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC) offense
classifications, which are converted into U.S. Marshals'
four-digit offense codes, which, in turn are aggregated into the
offense categories shown in the tables.  These categories are
similar, but may not be directly comparable to the BJS offense
categories used in other chapters of this Compendium.  For data
from the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, which include
United States Code citations but do not include the
Administrative Office offense classifications, United States
Code titles and sections are translated into the Administrative
Office classification system and then aggregated into the
offense categories used in the tables.  Offense categories for
prisoners in chapter 7 are based on combinations of offense
designations used by the Bureau of Prisons.  They are similar to
the categories in other chapters and other tables in chapter 7,
but may not be directly comparable.

Felony/misdemeanor distinctions

Felony and misdemeanor distinctions are provided where possible.
 Felony offenses are those with a maximum penalty of  more than
1 year in prison.  Misdemeanor offenses are those with a maximum
penalty of 1 year or less.  Felonies and misdemeanors are
further classified using the maximum term of imprisonment
authorized.  Section 3559, U.S. Code, Title 18 classifies
offenses according to the following schedule:

Felonies

Class A felony  life imprisonment, or if the maximum penalty is
death.

Class B felony  25 years or more.

Class C felony   less than 25 years but more than 10 years.

Class D felony   less than 10 years but more than 5 years.

Class E felony   less than 5 years but more than 1 year.

Misdemeanors

Class A misdemeanor  1 year or less but more than 1 month.

Class B misdemeanor  6 months or less but more than 30 days.

Class C misdemeanor  30 days or less but more than 5 days.

Infraction  5 days or less, or if no imprisonment is authorized.

In this Compendium, felony and misdemeanor distinctions are
provided where the data permit these distinctions.  Chapter 2
does not use this distinction because many suspects cannot be so
classified at the investigation stage in the criminal justice
process.  Chapter 3 no longer reports this distinction because
the Pretrial Services Agency no longer gathers this information.
Chapters 4 and 5 distinguish between felony and misdemeanor
offenses, as do tables 7.17.6.  Tables 7.77.11 follow the
convention of other BJS publications by separately tabulating
offenders whose actual imposed sentences are less than or equal
to 1 year and those whose actual sentences are greater than 1
year.

Most serious offense selection

Where more than one offense is charged or adjudicated, the most
serious offense (the one that may or did result in the most
severe sentence) is used to classify offenses. The offense
description may change as the criminal justice process proceeds.
 Tables indicate whether investigated, charged or adjudicated
offenses are used.  In chapter 2, the most serious offense is
based on the criminal lead charge as determined by the assistant
U.S. attorney responsible for the criminal proceeding.  In
chapter 3, the major charged offense is based upon the
Administrative Office's offense severity classification system,
as determined by the pretrial officer responsible for the case. 
To select this offense, the officer ranks offenses according to
severity based on maximum imprisonment, type of crime, and
maximum fines.  In chapter 4, the most serious offense charged
is the one that has the most severe potential sentence.  For
chapter 5, conviction offenses are based on statutory maximum
penalties.  In chapter 6, offenses are classified by the offense
of conviction.  In tables 7.17.6, the most serious offense of
conviction is either the one having the longest sentence imposed
or, if equal sentences were imposed or there was no
imprisonment, it was the offense carrying the highest severity
code as determined by the Administrative Office's offense
severity code ranking.  In tables 7.77.13, prisoners are
classified according to the offense which bears the longest
single incarceration sentence. 

Offense categories

For offense categories in all text tables, the following
conditions apply:

"Murder" includes nonnegligent manslaughter.

"Other sex offenses" may include some nonviolent offenses.

"Fraud" excludes tax fraud.

"Larceny" excludes transportation of stolen property.

"Other property felonies" excludes fraudulent property offenses,
and includes destruction of property and trespass.

"Tax law violations" includes tax fraud.

"Obscene material" denotes the mail or transport thereof.

"All other felonies" includes felonies with unknown or
unclassifiable offense type.

"Misdemeanors" includes misdemeanors, petty offenses, and
unknown offense levels.

"Drug possession" also includes other drug misdemeanors.

Figure S.2.

Figure S.2. uses data from the Executive Office for U.S.
Attorneys and the  Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to
provide an overview of case processing in the Federal criminal
justice system.  The figure uses data from two separate cohorts
of persons involved in criminal proceedings.  The data on
suspects in criminal matters concluded and defendants prosecuted
come from the cohort of suspects in matters concluded during
October 1, 1997, through September 30, 1998.  (The filing of
charges in a criminal case is one conclusion of a matter; the
other is the declination of the matter for prosecution.)  For
the other three outcomes in figure S.2. offenders convicted,
sentenced to prison, or given a term of probation  the data
come from the cohort of defendants in cases terminating during
fiscal year 1998 in U.S. district courts (by either a judge or a
magistrate).

A total of 106,022 suspects were investigated in matters
concluded by U.S. attorneys during 1998 (table 2.2).
Seventy-three percent of these suspects were prosecuted in U.S.
district court, either before U.S. district court judges
(64,993/106,022 = 61.3%) or before U.S. magistrates (12,243/
106,022 = 11.5%).  The conviction data in figureS.2. refer to
defendants in cases terminated in U.S. district court during
1998, whether before U.S. district court judges or U.S.
magistrates.  Fifty-seven percent (60,958/106,022) of the
defendants in cases terminating during 1998 were convicted
(table 4.2).

Of the defendants investigated, 41% (43,041/106,022) were
reported as sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and 12%
(12,744/106,022) were sentenced to a term of probation without
imprisonment (table 5.2).  These figures are based on all
charges, whether they eventually were felony or misdemeanor
offenses.

Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines that should
result in a sentence different from that described (18 U.S.C. §
3553(b); U.S.S.G. § 5K2.0).  (See also, "Substantial

offenders.  Pursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984,
parole was abolished and defendants are required to serve the
imposed sentence (less 54 days per year good-time for sentences
greater than 1 year, but not life imprisonment), followed by a
term of supervised release.  Because of the number of Federal
inmates sentenced under pre-Sentencing Reform provisions, parole
is being phased out.

§ 213; 15 U.S.C. § 2614; 18 U.S.C. §§ 401, 402, 1504, 1506,
1508, 1510, 1512(b), 1513, and 1622; 28 U.S.C. § 1866(g); 42

way sexual conduct; and if the work taken as a whole lacks
serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.

possessing any punch, die, plate, stone, or any other thing
designed to reproduce the label upon any drug or container is an
offense under this category.  Distributing a small amount of
marijuana for no remuneration is treated as simple possession
and, therefore, is included in this offense category (for
example, 21 U.S.C. §§ 829 (a)(b)(c), 841(a)(b)(d)(g), 842(a)(c),
843(a), 844(a), 846, 955, and 962).

incarceration.  An act of clemency available only to those found
eligible by the court, probation offers a chance for reform and
rehabilitation for the defendant.  For this purpose, the
defendant must agree to specified standards of conduct;
violation of such standards subjects his liberty to revocation.

elements of deceit or intentional misrepresentation. 
Specifically includes embezzlement, fraud (excluding tax fraud),
forgery, and counterfeiting.

Property offenses, non-fraudulent violent offenses against

Public-order offenses, other  violations of laws pertaining to
bigamy, disorderly conduct on the U.S. Capitol grounds, civil
