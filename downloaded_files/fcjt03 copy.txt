Federal criminal justice trends, 1994-2003

Number of suspects/defendants increased steadily 
across all stages of the Federal criminal justice 
system 

Drug offenders most prevalent; immigration and 
weapon offenders increased most rapidly

* The 10-year average annual increase was greatest 
for immigration (ranging from 14% for arrests to 
25% for prison sentences imposed) and weapon 
offenses (ranging from 10% for prosecution to 11%
for matters investigated by U.S. Attorneys). 

* Drug offenses remained the most prevalent offense 
across stages over 10-year period.

Southwest United States produced a disproportionate 
share of suspects and defendants processed

* Five of 94 Federal judicial districts (Southern 
District of California, District of Arizona, 
District of New Mexico and Southern and Western 
Districts of Texas) comprised 31% of all suspects 
arrested and booked, 19% of suspects investigated, 
23% of defendants in cases filed in U.S. district 
court, and 28% of offenders sentenced to prison
(1994-2003).

Likelihood of prosecution, conviction, 
and imprisonment sentence increased

increased by an average of 6% each year from 1994 
to 2003. 

The number of defendants detained at anytime prior

Five Federal judicial districts along the Southwest 
U.S. border comprised 48% of the growth in persons 
detained at any time prior to trial from 1994 to 
2003.

Unsecured bond remained the primary method of release
for defendants released any time prior to case 
disposition during the 1994-2003 period.

A greater percentage of defendants released prior 
to trial violated a condition of their release
(technical violation, new crime, failure to appear) 
in 2003 (20%) compared with 1994 (15%).

Most defendants in pretrial cases commenced from 
1994-2003 had a prior conviction.

* The proportion of pretrial defendants with a prior 
conviction at initial hearing has been increasing.

The characteristics of defendants with a prior 
conviction varied modestly from all offenders.

II. Cases filed and terminated in U.S. district 
court

From 1994 to 2003, 23% of criminal cases were filed 
in Federal judicial districts along the Southwest 
U.S. Border

Defendants in criminal cases concluded in U.S. 
district court increased at a yearly average of 4% from 
1994 to 2003 with immigration offenses increasing at 
the greatest rate.

* The percent of defendants convicted increased for 
all types of felonies.

Three Federal judicial districts had a trial rate 
(percent of bench or jury trials of all concluded cases) 
that was more than double the national average of 6% 
from 1994-2003. Three districts had a trial rate that 
was less than half the national average.

The proportion of all defendants convicted in the Federal
courts increased from 83% during 1994 to 89% in 2003.

* The median case processing time from case filing to
disposition increased from 5 months in 1994 to 6 months 
in 2003.
     
* Cases concluded before a jury declined from 4,639 
in 1994 to 2,909 in 2003.

In 2003 the most common types of counsel at case
termination were public defender and Criminal Justice Act
appointed counsel.

Type of counsel at case termination varied by type 
of offense:

* In 2003 more than 40% of the caseload for Criminal 
Justice Act-appointed and private counsel was made up 
of drug offenses.

* Immigration offenses comprised almost one-third of the
caseload for public defenders in 2003. 

Defendants convicted in U.S. District courts in 1996
differed from those convicted in 2003.

III. Defendants sentenced

Seventy-six percent of sentenced defendants received 
some imprisonment in 2003 compared with 65% in 1994.

* The percent of sentenced defendants receiving a prison
sentence increased across all felony offenses
for the 10-year period.
     
During 2003 the average prison sentence was greatest 
for violent (98 months), weapons (84 months), and drug 
offenders (82 months).

The average prison sentence imposed decreased from 63
months in 1994 to 59 months in 2003.
    
* The number of defendants sentenced to prison increased 
at a yearly average of 7% over the 10-year period.

Probation-only sentences imposed decreased at an annual
average of 1% across the 10-year period.

Most Federal judicial districts (81 out of 94) sentenced
defendants within the ranges determined by the U.S.
Sentencing Guidelines at least 60% of the time from
1994-2003.

Defendants convicted and sentenced for property and violent
offenses were more likely to be sentenced within the ranges
determined by the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines than defendants
convicted of drug or immigration offenses from 1994-2003.

* The percent of immigration offenders sentenced within the
guidelines decreased from 91% in 1994 to 69% in 2003.

Sixty-nine percent of defendants sentenced in 2003 received
sentences within ranges set forth under the Federal
sentencing guidelines (compared with 72% in 1994).

* Substantial assistance departures (where a defendant
receives a reduction in the guideline sentence for assisting
the Government) comprised 16% of sentences in 2003
compared with 20% in 1994.
     
* One percent or less of defendants sentenced between 1994
and 2003 received an upward departure (where a defendant
receives a more severe sentence due to aggravating factors).

The percent of drug offenders sentenced who received a
statutory minimum sentence of 5 years or more under the
Federal sentencing guidelines decreased from 66% in 1996
to 60% in 2003.

Just over half (54%) of defendants sentenced under the
Federal sentencing guidelines from 1994-2003 were
assigned the lowest criminal history score level as
determined by the guidelines at sentencing.

The safety valve provision permits the court to impose 
a sentence without regard to the statutory drug minimum
taking into account the defendant's criminal history, 
role in offense and cooperation with authorities as well 
as whether offense involved death/injury, weapons or 
violence (see: 18 U.S.C. sec. 3553(f)).

Drug defendants in 3 Federal judicial districts received 
the safety valve provision at nearly double the national 
rate of 30%.

The safety valve provision was increasingly used for 
drug offenders over this period: 38% of drug defendants 
received the safety valve provision in 2003 compared 
with 25% in 1998.

Some offenders assisting the Government in investigations
and prosecution of others met the criteria for a reduction 
in sentence under Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of 
Criminal Procedure. 

* Twenty-nine percent of Rule 35(b) defendant
resentencings from 1992 to 2001 occurred in four
Federal judicial districts.

Between 1992 and 2001, average sentence length
reductions for prisoners resentenced under 
Rule 35(b) ranged from 36% to 43%.

IV. Cases appealed

Guideline-based appeals comprised 85% of appeals
terminated from 1994-2003.

Criminal appeals increased an annual average of 2% from
1994-2003 with the bulk of this growth occurring among
appellants with an immigration offense as the most serious
offense of conviction.

* The rate of appeals per 100 convictions decreased
from 21 appeals per 100 convictions in 1994 to 16
appeals per 100 convictions in 2003.
     
* The rate of appeals for drug offenses decreased the
most over this period.

Most criminal appeals terminated from 1994 to 2003
(77%) were terminated on the merits of the case;
and, of these, the majority (85%) affirmed the
decision of the lower court in whole or in part.

Corrections trends

I. Offenders in the custody and under the jurisdiction
of the Federal Bureau of Prisons

Most offenders under the jurisdiction of the Federal
Bureau of Prisons were classified as medium or
Low custody from 1995-2003.

Offenders under the jurisdiction and in custody of the
Federal Bureau of Prisons increased at similar rates
from 1994 to 2003-an average annual rate of 7%.

II. Offenders in the custody of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons

Drug offenders comprised 57% of the Federal prison
population in 2003 compared with 61% in 1994. Immigration
(24%) and weapon offenders (10%) increased at the greatest
rate from 1994 to 2003.

Characteristics of the Federal prison population changed
moderately from 1994 to 2003.

Male offenders comprised 93% of inmates in the custody of
the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 2003 and increased an
annual average of 7% from 1994 to 2003; females comprised
7% of inmates in 2003 and increased by an annual average
of 6% from 1994 to 2003.

Twenty-six percent of offenders in the custody of the
Federal Bureau of Prisons in 2003 had been
incarcerated more than 5 years compared with 9% of
offenders in 1994.

Inmates 50 years and older comprised 13% of the
population in the custody of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons and 22% of the inmates who had served 5 years
or more at fiscal yearend 2003.

Expected time to be served in Federal prison increased an
average of 5% each year (1987-2003) from 23 months in
1987 to 48 months in 2003. 
      
* Actual time served also increased an average of 5%
each year over the same period from 15 months in
1987 to 33 months in 2003.  Expected time to be
served in Federal prison increased an average of 5%
each year (1987-2003) from 23 months in 1987 to 48
months in 2003.

Of offenders who had been released from Federal prison
for the first time, the average prison time served was 
33 months in 2003 compared with 25 months in 1994. 

* Increases in average time served were greatest for 
weapon offenders followed by immigration, 
and drug offenders.

III. Offenders on Federal supervision

The number of offenders on supervision (probation,
supervised release, and parole) increased an average 
of 3% per year from 1994 to 2003.

* More than two of three offenders on Federal supervision 
in 2003 were on supervised release.

Drug offenses surpassed property offenses as most
common offense of offenders under Federal supervision.

* Forty-two percent of defendants under supervision were
convicted of drug offenses in 2003 compared with 32% in
1994.

Offenders under supervised release increased at an
average annual rate of 9% between 1994 and 2003.

Characteristics of offenders under Federal supervision from
1994-2003 varied by type of supervision. For example, 23%
of offenders on probation at yearend 2003 had a known
drug history compared to 47% of offenders on supervised
release and 44% of offenders on parole.

Drug offenders under Federal supervision increased from
30,198 in 1994 to 47,826 in 2003.

Five Federal judicial districts along the Southwest U.S.
border and the Central district of California comprised 32%
of the growth in offenders under Federal supervision from
1994 to 2003.

Parolees were more likely to violate conditions of
supervision (technical violation, new crime) than
offenders on supervised release or probation in 2003.

Figure 27, p. 24. Figure depicts the sentencing grid used to
determine sentence imposed. Along the vertical axis are 43
offense levels which are ranked in terms of severity of offense
from least (1) to most (43). Each Federal offense is
associated with an offense severity score. The offense level
is subject to modification depending upon aggravating and
mitigating factors. The horizontal axis shows the defendant's
criminal history score. A criminal history score of 1
corresponds to the mildest criminal history (including no prior
convictions/arrests). The criminal history score increases with
the magnitude and/or seriousness of the defendant's prior
criminal history. The sentencing grid (shown in figure) is used
to locate the cell corresponding to the defendant's final
offense severity score and criminal history score. A frequency
of the final cell used to determine the defendant's sentence
was generated for all defendants sentenced under the
Federal guidelines from 1994 to 2003. This distribution is
shown in figure. For example, 3% of all defendants sentenced
under the guidelines from 1994 to 2003 were sentenced in the
cell corresponding to an offense severity score of 6 and a
criminal history score of 1. Darker shading refers to cells with
a relatively greater share of the total percent of sentences
imposed across this 10-year period. Lighter shading refers to
cells with a relatively lesser share of the total sentences
imposed. Of 530,433 defendants sentenced, 31,727 were
missing information on offense severity/criminal history score.
A small share of defendants were sentenced under more than
one guideline and are not displayed. There were a total of
498,706 cases with complete information on final criminal
history score and offense severity score. Source: U.S.

Figure 28, p. 25. Map shows the rate for each Federal judicial
district of sentenced drug offenders who received a safety

relief from statutory minimum sentences with 1) Government's
recommendation and 2) if the defendant meets the following
criteria: no more than 1 criminal history point, no use of
violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm
or other dangerous weapon in connection with offense;
offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any
person; defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager, or
supervisor of others in the offense and was not engaged in
continuing criminal enterprise; defendant has truthfully
provided to the Government. Percents based on non-missing
data. Missing ranged from 6% of cases in 1994 to 12% in
2003 (missing safety valve and/or complete guideline
application information). Source: U.S. Sentencing

Figure 29, p. 26. The map shows the distribution of
resentencing under Rule 35(b) by Federal judicial district.
Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits
the reduction of sentence for substantial assistance to the
Government. Upon the Government's motion within 1 year of
sentencing, the court may reduce the offender's sentence if
the offender provided substantial assistance in the
investigation or prosecution of another person and that the
reduction in sentence complies with the Federal sentencing
guidelines and policy statement by the U.S. Sentencing
Commission. The Government may make a motion more than
1 year after sentencing to reduce the sentence of an offender
if the information wasn't known to the defendant 1 year or
more after sentencing or the information provided to the
Government within 1 year of sentencing did not become
useful to the Government until more than 1 year after
sentencing. Source: Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP), online

Methodology

The Federal justice database

The source of data for all tables in Federal
Criminal Justice Trends is the Bureau of
Justice Statistics (BJS) Federal justice
database. The database is constructed from
source files provided by the U.S. Marshals
Service (USMS), the Drug Enforcement
Administration (DEA), the Executive Office
for U.S. Attorneys (EOUSA), the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts
(AOUSC), the United States Sentencing
Commission (USSC), and the Federal
Bureau of Prisons (BOP).  AOUSC also
maintains the data collected by the U.S.
Court of Appeals and the Federal Probation
and Supervision Information System
(FPSIS). 

The universe of the BJS Federal justice
database includes criminal suspects
investigated for violations of Federal criminal
law, criminal suspects arrested for violations
of Federal criminal law, defendants in
Federal pretrial cases opened, defendants in
cases filed in U.S. district courts, and
offenders entering Federal corrections and
correctional supervision.

Wherever possible matters or cases were
selected based on an event that occurred
during each fiscal year (October 1 through
September 30) from 1994 through 2003. 

The offense classification procedure used in
this report is based on the classification
system followed by the AOUSC. Specific
offenses in the AOUSC classification are
combined to form the BJS categories shown
in this report's tables (see Compendium of
Federal Justice Statistics, 2003 (NCJ
210299) available on-line from the Bureau of
Justice Statistics website.

Felony and misdemeanor distinctions are
provided where possible. Felony offenses
are those with a maximum penalty of more
than 1 year in prison. Misdemeanor offenses
have a maximum penalty of 1 year or less. 

Offenses in the tables are classified, at the
most general level, into felony and
misdemeanor categories. Felonies are
divided into six main level offense
classifications: violent, property, drug,
public-order, weapon and immigration
offenses. Property and public-order offenses
have two sub-levels. The main-level and
sub-group categories are composed of
individual offense types. When possible drug
offenses are divided into the individual
offense level.

"Other public-order offenses" include detail at
the individual offense type level. Table M.1
shows a list of specific offenses under each
offense category.
