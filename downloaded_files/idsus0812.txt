Indigent Defense Services in the 
United States, FY 2008–2012

Stephen D. Owens, Elizabeth Accetta, Jennifer J. Charles, 
and Samantha E. Shoemaker, U.S. Census Bureau

*************
Background
*************

The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states that all persons 
accused of a crime have the right to counsel in their defense. 
Explicitly, the Sixth Amendment states that—

**In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a 
speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the state and district 
wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have 
been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and 
cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; 
to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to 
have the assistance of counsel for his defense. ***Footnote 1 U.S. Const. 
amend. XI.***

Over the legal history of the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled 
that the Sixth Amendment requires the levels of government to provide 
counsel to persons accused of crime who cannot afford to hire a lawyer. 
The right of appointing counsel applies to the federal government from 
the Sixth Amendment and to the state governments under the due process 
clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. To comply with the U.S. Supreme 
Court’s directives, state governments have established a range of 
indigent defense services.

Indigent defense methods of administration and operation vary by state. 
Some states administer all programs at the state level (i.e., state run), 
some administer all programs at the county level, and some have a hybrid 
delivery system in place. The operation and funding of indigent defense 
programs also varies by state. In some states, all funding is provided by 
the state (i.e., state funded), while in other states, funding is a 
shared responsibility among state and local governments. The Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania is the only state that leaves the entire responsibility 
for funding indigent defense to the local governments, in particular, to 
counties.

This report describes the indigent defense system for each state and the 
District of Columbia, including information on administration, methods of 
operation, and funding. It provides both direct and intergovernmental 
indigent defense expenditures of state governments for fiscal years 2008 
through 2012, and it presents local government expenditures aggregated at 
the state level. The report uses administrative data from the U.S. Census 
Bureau’s Government Finance Survey and available data from state 
government budget and appropriation documents.

State government data used in this report along with total state 
government judicial-legal expenditures are also presented in the BJS 
report, State Government Expenditures, FY 2008–2012, NCJ 246684, BJS web, 
July 2014.

*************
Methodology
*************

Legal research
******************

The information presented in each state’s section was collected by 
searching for the authorizing statutes in each state and basic research 
on the programs’ websites. The information gathered includes each state’s 
indigent defense program information, responsibility at each government 
level for both the administration and funding, and the board composition.

Obtaining expenditure data
****************************

State government expenditures were obtained from a database query of the 
data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State Government 
Finances. A significant portion of the expenditure data for this survey 
was collected from administrative records provided by each state 
government. A query of the database on keywords of descriptions provided 
the initial collection of expenditures. On the rare instance when detail 
was unavailable, an external source was consulted to obtain actual data. 
(See appendix table 1 for state government indigent defense expenditures 
by state for fiscal years 2008 through 2012.)

Depending on the state’s organization, expenditures for retirement and 
other benefits for employees may not be included. (See appendix table 2 
for a summary of which state expenditures include retirement benefits.) 
This is largely due to the state having a centralized agency that reports 
retirement benefits for the entire state government. Because it is a 
central agency, the detail provided does not separate each payment by 
government agency, leaving these expenditures unavailable.

To obtain local government expenditures, a query similar to that of state 
expenditures was run from the Annual Survey of Local Government Finances 
when available. Some states have worked with the Census Bureau to 
establish central collection agreements in the form of administrative 
record data for each local government. In other cases, larger local 
governments provided the Census Bureau with administrative records 
similar to the state government records. In these cases, the Census 
Bureau was able to query the database on keywords of descriptions. In 
instances in which only specific local governments were responsible for 
indigent defense expenditures, an external source was used.

Comparing Census Bureau data 
to an external source
****************************

To determine the accuracy of data presented from the Annual Survey of 
State Government Finances, the Census Bureau compared these data to 
information provided by external sources, including state budgets, state 
comprehensive annual financial reports, agency reports, and appropriation 
bills. This enabled the Census Bureau to compare actual reported 
expenditures from a state source and expenditures queried in the Census 
Bureau database. 

Appendix table 2 provides a summary of each external source, whether the 
external amounts were appropriated or actual amounts, and the percentage 
difference between Census Bureau data and external amounts. The year used 
for comparison was fiscal year 2011. The tables provided in the report 
also show external amounts for each fiscal year from 2008 through 2012. 
Appendix A provides a brief summary of the causes for disparity between 
external amounts and Census Bureau data.

Alabama
*********

Office of Indigent Defense Services 
(est. 1975) Code of Alabama § 
12-19-252; 15-12-1 
*************************************

Alabama’s Office of Indigent Defense Services provides a state-run 
indigent defense system. It is located within the state’s Department of 
Finance and is administered by a director.  The Office of Indigent 
Defense Services provides services to defendants in criminal or juvenile 
proceedings in the trial and appellate courts of the state, including 
parents of children during termination of parental rights hearings.
Alabama imposes a Fair Trial Tax to fund the expenses of providing 
indigent defense in the state. If the proceeds from the tax fail to cover 
the cost of services, the legislature may annually appropriate the 
necessary amount from the state treasury’s General Fund. Some counties 
are authorized to impose a court cost for defender services. In these 
counties, the county funds defender services from the revenues of the 
court cost, and the state pays a reasonable share of the cost of 
maintaining such an office, as determined by the director. 
  
Local administration Code of Alabama 
§ 15-12-1 
*************************************
In each judicial circuit in the state, a voluntary indigent defense 
advisory board is comprised of five members, including the presiding 
circuit judge, the president of the local circuit bar association, and 
three attorneys appointed by the bar commissioner(s) for that circuit. 
Each board is responsible for determining the permitted method or methods 
of indigent defense services in the circuit. The methods include one or a 
combination of the following: use of appointed counsel, use of contract 
counsel, and use of public defenders. In circuits where a public defender 
office is established, the director appoints a public defender for said 
circuit. The public defender may hire a deputy director and staff. A 
public defender may represent defendants in municipal court at the 
request and consent of a municipal governing body. The municipality 
reimburses the office for these services. The director approves the 
operating expenses, salaries, benefits, and overall budget of each office 
in advance.

Alaska
********

Public Defender Agency (est. 1969)
Alaska Stat. § 18.85.010 through 18.85.080
*******************************************

The Public Defender Agency, located in the state’s Department of 
Administration, serves the needs of indigent defendants in the State of 
Alaska. A public defender appointed by the governor, subject to 
confirmation by the legislature, administers the agency. The public 
defender may appoint individuals and delegate responsibilities to carry 
out the functions of the agency. The public defender may use 
appropriations to contract private attorneys to provide services to 
indigent defendants. Currently, 13 offices are located throughout the 
state to help provide these services.

The court may determine indigence for an individual who is charged with a 
serious crime; is entitled to representation under the Supreme Court 
Delinquency or Child in Need of Aid Rules; is isolated, quarantined, or 
required to be tested under order for disease control and threats to 
public health; or against whom commitment proceedings for mental illness 
have been initiated. The Public Defender Agency is comprised of four 
divisions to provide various services:

* The Criminal Division provides representation to individuals charged 
with felony and misdemeanor offenses, from arraignment through trial and 
sentencing, including felony and misdemeanor petitions to revoke 
probation.

* The Civil Division is responsible for Child in Need of Aid cases, and 
represents minors in juvenile delinquency cases and individuals subject 
to civil commitment proceedings.

* The Appellate Division handles appeals statewide for criminal cases, 
Child in Need of Aid cases, and juvenile delinquency cases. It also 
handles post-conviction relief applications and parole hearings.

* The Administrative Section provides statewide administrative services 
and support to the agency’s 13 offices.

Alaska Office of Public Advocacy (est. 1984)
Alaska Stat. § 44.21.400 through 44.21.470
********************************************

The Office of Public Advocacy, located in the state’s Department 
of Administration, oversees indigent defense in cases where the 
Public Defender Agency has a conflict. Although the office also 
serves several other functions, including public guardianship 
and civil prosecution of persons accused of defrauding indigent 
senior citizens, approximately 65% of the office’s budget is 
dedicated to indigent defense.

********
Arizona 
********

Public Defender Training Fund Ariz. Rev. 
Stat. Ann. § 12-117
*******************************************

The Arizona Supreme Court administers the Public Defender Training Fund 
to provide monies for public defender training. Funds are distributed to 
county public defender offices in proportion to the number of felony 
cases assigned to that office in the previous fiscal year. 

State Aid to Indigent Defense Fund (est. 1999)
Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 11-588
**********************************************

County funds and court-ordered administrative assessments and 
reimbursements are appropriated to finance indigent defense services. A 
county may be reimbursed for expenses incurred to provide public defender 
services to municipal courts or agencies not under the jurisdiction of 
the county. The State Aid to Indigent Defense Fund, administered by the 
Arizona Criminal Justice Commission, provides state aid to the county 
public defender, legal defender, and contract indigent defense counsel 
for the processing of criminal cases. The fund consists of monies 
collected by the Arizona Supreme Court and Arizona Court of Appeals to 
pay for filing fees, surcharges on certain fees, and penalties for 
criminal and some civil offenses.

State Capital Postconviction Public Defender 
Office
**********************************************

The State Capital Postconviction Public Defender Office in Arizona was 
abolished in 2012. The office was responsible for providing 
representation to indigent persons convicted of the death penalty in 
post-conviction relief proceedings in the state court. The state capital 
post-conviction public defender was appointed by the governor.

Local administration
**********************************************

The board of supervisors in a county may establish an office of the 
public defender and appoint said public defender. A public defender may 
appoint deputies, with the consent of the board of supervisors and other 
personnel. The public defender is responsible for submitting an annual 
report to the board of supervisors on its activities. Services may be 
provided for defendants facing offenses triable in the state superior 
court or justice courts at all stages of proceedings, extradition 
hearings, mental disorder hearings, involuntary commitment hearings, 
juvenile delinquency and incorrigibility proceedings, appeals to the 
higher courts, all juvenile proceedings other than delinquency and 
incorrigibility proceedings, and all mental health hearings regarding 
release recommendations held before the psychiatric security review 
board. Services may be provided by court-appointed counsel or public 
defenders in counties that have established such an office.

The City of Phoenix and Maricopa County provided data to the Census 
Bureau.

Arkansas
**********

Arkansas Public Defender Commission (est. 1997)
Ark. Code Ann. § 16-87-201 through 16-87-218
**********************************************

While counties in Arkansas have responsibility for some indigent 
defense expenses in the state, the Arkansas Public Defender 
Commission is primarily responsible for these services. 
The commission has the power to—

* establish policies and standards for the public defender systems 
throughout the state, including standards for determining who qualifies 
as an indigent person

* establish policies and standards for the organization and operation of 
public defenders’ offices throughout the state, including funding, 
compensation, staffing, and standards of experience for attorneys 
assigned to particular cases

* allocate personnel for each public defender’s office throughout the 
state, and approve the reassignment of cases from one public defender to 
another public defender in an adjacent area for the purpose of avoiding 
conflicts or adjusting caseloads

* maintain for each judicial district a current list of private attorneys 
who are willing to accept court appointments and who meet any other 
qualifications established by the commission

* maintain a separate list of private attorneys who are willing to accept 
court appointments in capital cases and who meet any other qualifications 
established by the commission.

The Trial Public Defender Office, under the Public Defender Commission, 
supervises the Arkansas trial public defender system’s development and 
operation of rules, regulations, and standards for governing that have 
been adopted by the commission. The commission’s Capital, Conflicts, and 
Appellate Division provides legal services to indigent defendants in 
capital and appellate cases, and cases in which local public defenders 
have a legal or ethical conflict. County or regional public defender 
offices are located in each of the state’s 23 judicial districts. Some 
districts have more than one office. Additionally, the commission has 
established conflict offices around the state. 

The commission has seven members appointed by the governor. At least four 
members of the commission must be attorneys who are licensed to practice 
law in the State of Arkansas and experienced in the defense of persons 
accused of crimes. At least one member of the commission must be a county 
judge, and at least one member must be a trial judge who hears criminal 
cases. No more than two members of the commission are residents of the 
same congressional district, and no two members of the commission are 
residents of the same county. The state assumes most of the obligation 
for funding indigent defense throughout the state, except for small 
county contributions toward running the county offices.

Office of the State Public Defender (est. 1796)
Cal. Gov. Code § 15400
***********************************************

California has a state public defender, who is appointed by the governor 
and subject to confirmation by the state senate. The state public 
defender may employ deputies and other personnel and may establish and 
operate offices to provide indigent defense services. The state public 
defender may contract with county public defenders, private attorneys, 
and nonprofit corporations to provide services. The primary focus of the 
state public defender is post-conviction appellate representation in 
death penalty cases. The state public defender is funded from the state’s 
General Fund. 
 
Habeas Corpus Resource Center (est. 1998)
Cal. Gov. Code § 68650
**********************************************

The State of California’s Habeas Corpus Resource Center, located in the 
judicial branch of the state government, provides attorneys to indigent 
persons convicted and sentenced to death in state and federal court post-
conviction actions. The center is governed by a board of directors and an 
executive director, who is selected by the board of directors and 
confirmed by the state senate. The California Supreme Court appoints 
attorneys of the center, which reports annually to the state legislature, 
governor, and state supreme court.

California Appellate Project 
(est. 1983)
**********************************************

The California Appellate Project provides representation to indigent 
persons in death penalty appeals and other criminal appeals before the 
California Supreme Court. In addition, the project provides 
representation to indigent persons in criminal, juvenile delinquency, and 
juvenile dependency cases pending before the Second Appellate District of 
the California Court of Appeal. The project is a nonprofit corporation 
established in 1983 by the State Bar of California, and the project’s 
board of directors is comprised of former officials of the State Bar. The 
project is funded primarily by a contract with the Judicial Council of 
California. 
 
Local administration Cal. Gov. Code § 22770
**********************************************

Indigent defense services in California are provided primarily at the 
county level, which may provide services through contract counsel, 
assigned counsel, or a public defender office. The board(s) of 
supervisors of one or more counties may establish an office of the public 
defender for the county or counties. When an office is established, it is 
determined whether the public defender is to be appointed or elected. 
Public defenders are appointed by and serve at the will of the county 
board(s) of supervisors. 

The boards of supervisors of two or more counties may authorize the 
respective public defenders to enter into reciprocal or mutual assistance 
agreements. Agreements allow counties to temporarily loan deputy public 
defenders to the county participating in the agreement to provide 
indigent defense services. The county receiving the loaned deputy public 
defender reimburses the county that provides services. A board of 
supervisors may also authorize the reciprocal or mutual assistance 
agreements with the state public defender. The county or counties is 
responsible for office expenses. A public defender will annually submit a 
report to the board(s) of supervisors on its activities and finances. 
Indigent defense services may be provided at all stages of legal 
proceedings to a defendant charged with any contempt or offense triable 
in the superior court, or in any civil litigation in which a defendant is 
being persecuted or unjustly harassed.

California is the only state for which the Census Bureau did not receive 
an electronic source. As a result, the expenditures for this state were 
compiled using the State of California Governor’s Budget. Amounts 
reported are actual expenditures.

attorney licensed to practice in Delaware. The office has one central 
administrative office and two regional offices. Most conflict cases are 
handled by a pool of private attorneys who are contracted by the state. 
The few conflict cases that are not handled by contract counsel are 
appointed to private attorneys. The Delaware Administrative Office of 
the Courts paid the attorneys and tracked the data on conflict counsel 
until 2011, when those functions were assumed by the Office of the 
Public Defender.

**********************************************

In the District of Columbia, indigent defense services are provided by 
the Public Defender Service (PDS), an independent legal organization that 
is governed by an 11-member board of trustees. PDS is a federal program; 
the service is federally funded, and funds are held in the U.S. Treasury. 
PDS attorneys generally represent indigent individuals in criminal 
appeals, in parole revocation hearings, in D.C. Superior Court Drug 
Intervention Program sanction hearings, facing involuntary commitment in

Litigation Division, Parole Division, Mental Health Division, Civil Legal 
Services Division, and Community Defender Division.

Private attorneys funded through the Criminal Justice Act provide 
representation for indigent individuals not represented by PDS. Both PDS 
and private attorneys providing representation are appointed by the 
District of Columbia courts. Services may be provided to indigent 
individuals who face a loss of liberty. Typically, the PDS handles 
criminal cases, while private attorneys provide representation to 
individuals facing less serious misdemeanor and regulatory offenses.

Florida
**********

Florida Public Defender Association (FPDA) 
(est. 1972) Not statutorily established
**********************************************

Indigent defense in Florida is completely state funded and is 
administered through a system of elected public defenders. A public 
defender is assigned to each of the 20 judicial circuits. Each public 
defender must have been a member of the Florida Bar for at least 5 years 
and must have been elected at a general election.

Public defenders provide representation at the trial level, while 
appellate representation is handled by five regional offices. Conflict 
cases are appointed to qualified private attorneys. Florida has created 
circuit indigent defense services committees, funded by the state, to 
oversee conflict attorneys in all criminal cases. In addition, three 
Capital Collateral Regional Counsel offices provide representation to 
indigent capital prisoners in state and federal post-conviction 
proceedings. A board of directors governs FPDA. The board is comprised 
of the 20 elected public defenders in Florida, plus two representatives 
of the assistant public defender staff and one representative apiece from 
public defender investigative and administrative staff.

Georgia Public Defender Standards Council 
(est. 2003) O.C.G.A. § 17-12-1
**********************************************

The Georgia Public Defender Standards Council is an independent agency 
within the executive branch of the state government that is responsible 
for overseeing indigent defense in the state. The council consists of 
nine appointed members. Circuit court defender offices and other

Georgia Capital Defender Division is located within the council to 
provide representation to indigent persons charged with capital felony 
cases with the possibility of a death sentence in trial court and appeals 
to the Supreme Court of Georgia.  

The council acts as the fiscal officer for all circuit public defender 
offices and is responsible for maintaining records of all monies received 
from each governing authority. The director, with input from the council, 
establishes procedures for providing representation to indigent 
defendants in case of conflict with a circuit public defender office, 
which may include appointing counsel on a case-by-case basis or using a 
different circuit public defender office. The council submits an annual 
report to the state general assembly, governor, and state supreme court. 
The council is also responsible for submitting a budget estimate to the 
director of the Office of Planning and Budget.

Counties may opt out of this system and operate an alternate 
delivery system

Local administration 
O.C.G.A. § 17-12-20
**********************************************

A circuit public defender supervisory panel is located in each judicial 
circuit in the Georgia. The panel consists of three members: one member 
appointed by the chief judge of the Superior Court of the Circuit, the 
governor, and the chairperson of the governing authority or sole 
commissioner in which the judicial circuit convenes. The circuit public 
defender supervisory panel and the director of the Georgia Public 
Defender Standards Council appoint the circuit public defender for each 
circuit. 

The circuit public defender determines indigence, supervises assistant 
public defenders and staff, administers daily operations of the office, 
and maintains records for the office. Each circuit public defender office 
has a juvenile division. The circuit public defender provides 
representation to indigent defendants for any case in the superior court 
or juvenile case with the possibility of imprisonment or probation, a 
suspended sentence of imprisonment that may be adjudged, or any direct 
appeal of the proceedings previously mentioned. Any city or county may 
contract with an office to provide representation for indigent persons 
accused of violating a city or county ordinance. The state general 
assembly funds circuit public defenders through the General 
Appropriations Act. Counties and cities may supplement additional funds 
for public defenders. The governing bodies of counties in a judicial 
circuit provide funding to cover public defender office costs.

Idaho
*******

Office of the State Appellate Public Defender 
(est. 1998) Idaho Code § 19-867
**********************************************

The Office of the State Appellate Public Defender, located in the state’s 
Department of Self-Governing Agencies, provides counsel to indigent 
defendants who have been convicted of a felony in district court and to 
petitioners in state felony post-conviction and habeas corpus cases. In 
capital cases, when a defendant has been sentenced to death, the office 
provides court representation for post-conviction proceedings and 
representation on appeal from both the denial of a post-conviction 
petition and the direct appeal from the judgment of conviction. 

The office is administered by the state appellate public defender, who is 
appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the state 
senate. The state pays the expenses of the office. The state appellate 
public defender may employ personnel and deputy state appellate public 
defenders to provide services. The state appellate public defender may 
also contract with private attorneys on a case-by-case basis. The office 
annually reports its activities to the state board of examiners, the 
supreme court, the legislature, and any of the participating counties 
that were provided services in a given year. 

Local administration 
Idaho Code § 19-851
**********************************************

Counties in Idaho are responsible for most indigent defense services in 
the state. Indigent defense services are provided at all stages of legal 
proceedings to a defendant who is formally charged or being detained 
under the conviction of a serious crime. Services may also be provided to 
any person being detained or confined and subject to hospitalization for 
mental illness or the inability to stand trial or make informed 
decisions. To provide indigent defense services, the board of county 
commissioners in each county establishes an office of the public defender 
or juvenile defender and makes an arrangement with the courts in the 
county to assign counsel, or some combination of these methods. 

One or more counties may choose to establish a joint office of the public 
defender. The board of county commissioners appoints the public defender 
or juvenile public defender. The county pays the fees of counsel assigned 
by the courts or appropriates funds for the office of the public 
defender. Assigned counsel and public defenders are required to submit an 
annual report to the county commissioners and, if appropriate, the 
administrative district judges on their activities and expenses. 

Counties may elect, on resolution of the county’s board of commissioners, 
to participate in a Capital Crimes Defense Fund, which is used to cover 
costs of criminal cases when the death penalty is a possibility. The fund 
is comprised of contributions from participating counties and any court 
fees or other funds designated or appropriated by the state legislature. 

The fund is operated under a joint powers agreement by participating 
counties. A board of representatives operates and administers the fund. 
The creating agreement determines how representatives are selected. A 
representative appointed by the governor may be added to the board if the 
fund receives appropriations from the legislature. An additional 
representative may be appointed by the Idaho Supreme Court if the fund is 
designated court fees. Only counties that participate in this fund are 
permitted to use services of the Office of the State Appellate Public 
Defender.

Office of the State Appellate Defender (est. 1972)
725 Ill. Comp. Stat. 105/1 through 105/11
**********************************************

The State Appellate Defender Office, a judicial department of the state, 
represents indigent defendants on appeal when appointed by the Illinois 
Supreme Court, appellate court, or circuit court. The appellate office 
has district-level offices in each of the five appellate districts of the 
state, with a deputy defender who serves as the administrator of the 
district office for each judicial district. The office also maintains a 
panel of private attorneys available to serve as counsel on a case-by-
case basis, hires investigators to provide investigative services to 
appointed counsel and county public defenders, provides training to 
county public defenders, and provides county public defenders with the 
assistance of expert witnesses and investigators from funds appropriated 
to the state appellate defender by the general assembly. 

The State Appellate Defender Commission, which advises the office, 
consists of nine members: a chairman appointed by the governor, one 
member appointed by the Illinois Supreme Court, one member appointed by 
each of the five appellate courts, one member appointed by the state 
supreme court from a panel of three persons nominated by the Illinois 
State Bar Association, and one member appointed by the governor from a 
panel of three persons nominated by the Illinois Public Defender 
Association. Because each county administers programs independently, no 
central agency or organization at the state level provides county 
expenditure in a central location.

Local administration
*********************

County public defenders provide for almost all indigent defense services 
in the State of Illinois. Each county in the state with 35,000 or more 
inhabitants has a public defender office. In counties with smaller 
populations, the county board may choose either to create a public 
defender office or use an alternate system of providing indigent defense 
services. When two or more adjoining counties are located within the same 
judicial circuit, the two counties may create a shared public defender 
office.The chief public defender is selected by the president of the 
county board of supervisors in Cook County and by the presiding circuit 
court judge in all other counties.  In addition, the state funds 
two-thirds of the chief defender’s salary.

**********************************************

A county executive may establish a county public defender board by 
ordinance. ***Footnote 2 The county executive of certain counties is 
based primarily on population, including Allen, Marion, St. Joseph, and 
Vanderburg Counties, which are not allowed to form county public defender 
boards under state statute. However, these counties may establish a 
county public defender office or agency under special county 
ordinance.*** A board consists of three members: two are appointed by 
county judges who exercise felony or juvenile jurisdiction, and one is 
appointed by the county executive. The board also prepares a plan on how 
to provide indigent defense services through one or more of the following 
methods: establishing a county public defender’s office, contracting with 
one or more attorneys or private organizations, using an assigned counsel 
system of panel attorneys on a case-by-case basis, and establishing a 
public defender’s office for the criminal division for the superior court 
in counties with a population of more than 400,000 but less than 700,000. 
If a county public defender office is established, the board must 
recommend an annual operating budget to the county fiscal body, appoint a 
county public defender, and submit annual reports on the office’s 
activities to the county executive, fiscal body, and judges. 

The public defender is responsible for maintaining the office and hiring 
staff, with the approval of the county executive and fiscal body, and may 
contract with attorneys to provide indigent defense services. 
Additionally, any judge who has criminal jurisdiction may request 
services from the state public defender in appeals of criminal cases. If 
the state public defender chooses to accept the case or appoints one of 
the state public defender’s deputies, the county in which the case 
originated pays the office for services rendered. 


All counties may submit requests for reimbursement from the state’s 
Public Defense Fund for 50% of a county’s expenditures for indigent 
defendants facing the death penalty, and eligible counties may seek 
reimbursements for 40% of county expenditures for noncapital crimes, not 
including misdemeanors. However, this has not always occurred in practice. 
A county is considered eligible for reimbursement of expenditures for 
noncapital crimes after passing an ordinance to create a public defender 
board and adopting a comprehensive plan in line with the standards of the 
Indiana Public Defender Commission. The fund is administered by the 
Division of State Court Administration of the Indiana 
Supreme Court.

A supplemental public defender fund is established in each county unless 
a county has a population of more than 400,000 but less than 700,000, in 
which case a fund must be established in each city that provides funding 
for a public defender to represent indigent defendants in city court. The 
fund consists of certain fees, including pretrial services fees and 
appropriations from the county.  

Services may be provided to any defendant confined in a penal facility in 
the state or committed to the Indiana Department of Corrections due to a 
criminal conviction or delinquency adjudication in a post-conviction 
proceeding.  

Of Indiana’s 92 counties, 62 are currently in the Public Defense Fund 
reimbursement program. However, 8 of the 62 counties in the program are 
not requesting or are not eligible for reimbursements.
Census data were also available for Indianapolis.

executive branch of the state government. Members of the board are 
appointed by the governor and subject to confirmation by the state 
senate, and the board appoints a state director of indigents’ defense 
services to serve as chief executive officer. The board helps to provide, 
coordinate, supervise, and adopt rules and regulations regarding indigent 
defense in the state. The board establishes in each county (or 
combination of counties) a system of appointed counsel, contractual 
arrangements for contract counsel, public defender offices, or any 
combination of methods for the delivery of services for indigent 
defendants accused of a felony. In addition, the board may enter into 
contracts with cities or counties to provide, at the expense of a city or 
county, for the defense of misdemeanors or other defense services. Courts 
may appoint an attorney other than a public defender, assistant public 
defender, or contract counsel to provide services to an indigent 
defendant. The board is also responsible for appointing public defenders 
and staff in counties with a public defender office. The system providing 
legal defense services for indigent persons, which is in existence and 
effect in each county and judicial district, is subject to change by the 
State Board of Indigents’ Defense Services. The board prepares and 
submits a budget and annual report to the governor and state legislature. 
 
Indigent defense services may be provided to a person charged by the 
state in a complaint, information, or indictment with any felony at every 
stage of proceedings, for extradition proceedings, or for a habeas corpus 
proceedings. In addition, services may be provided to an individual who 
is subject to order or commitment due to mental illness. An indigent 
defendant convicted of a felony, capital crime, or on filing a motion for 
writ of habeas corpus or motion attacking sentence may receive services 
in appellate court through the Appellate Defender Office in the State 
Board of Indigents’ Defense Services. Any nonprofit may provide legal 
services to indigent inmates of Kansas correctional institutions. In such 
cases, the nonprofit is allowed to request reimbursement for the 
operating budget from the State Board of Indigents’ Services.

Counties in Kansas are responsible for indigent defense for misdemeanor

statewide public advocacy system delivery of indigent defense services in 
the state’s 120 counties. The Public Advocacy Commission has nine 
members, plus deans of Kentucky’s law schools: two members are appointed 
by the governor; one member is appointed by the governor and must be a 
child advocate or a person with substantial experience in the 
representation of children; two members are appointed by the Kentucky 
Supreme Court; three members are licensed to practice law in Kentucky, 
have substantial experience in the representation of persons accused of 
crime, and are appointed by the governor from a list of three persons 
submitted to the governor for each individual vacancy by the board of 
governors of the Kentucky Bar Association; and one member is appointed by 
the governor from a list of three persons submitted to him or her by the 
joint advisory boards of the Protection and Advocacy Division of the DPA. 
The dean of each of the law schools in Kentucky or a designee also serves 
as ex officio members.

By statute, the state is responsible for funding indigent defense in 
Kentucky. Several counties have elected to use its own plan for delivery 
of services, in which case the county contributes local funds to augment 
the state appropriation. The DPA currently operates public defender 
programs in every county, with some offices covering multiple counties. 
Kentucky law also requires each county to appropriate 12.5 cents per-
capita of the county population to a fund established to cover court 
orders entered against counties, such as expert witness fees and other 
comparable expenses associated with providing indigent defense services.

Local expenditures for public defender programs in Kentucky show the

The Louisiana Public Defender Board provides supervision, administration, 
and delivery of a statewide public defender system, which must deliver 
uniform public defender services in all courts in this state. The board 
creates mandatory standards and guidelines, which require that public 
defender services be provided in a way that is fair and consistent 
throughout the state. Other responsibilities include--

* developing mandatory qualification standards for public defenders that 
ensure public defender services are provided by competent counsel

* establishing methods of monitoring and evaluating service performance 
and compliance with standards and guidelines

* enacting policies to ensure that detailed revenue, expenditure, and 
workload data is collected, recorded, and used for the improvement of the 
system

* providing minimum compensation standards for attorneys and all non-
attorney support staff employed to support the delivery of public defense 
services

* establishing processes and procedures to ensure that information 
technology is available, accessible, and consistently used to improve the 
system’s programs and accountability.

A majority of the 42 judicial districts in Louisiana contracted 501(c)3 
organizations for services, while some districts have full-time public 
defender programs. Contract attorneys also represent indigent defendants 
in delinquency, capital, and appellate cases where conflict cases arise. 
All district indigent defender boards have contracted with the Louisiana 
Appellate Project to supplement its staff with these services. The 
district public defender for these services is of no cost; it is a form 
of supplemental assistance.

The board consists of 15 members: two members are appointed by the 
governor; two members are appointed by the chief justice of the Supreme 
Court of Louisiana; one member must be a juvenile justice advocate; one 
member must be a retired judge with criminal law experience; one member

Counties provide resources for their indigent defense systems. However, 
counties may request reimbursements for a portion of their expenditures. 
The county clerk in qualifying counties may request from the State 
Commission on Public Advocacy reimbursements for 25% the total amount for 
a county’s actual expenditures for indigent defense services in felony 
cases from funds appropriated by the state legislature. 

In counties without an Office of Public Defender or Office of Judicial 
District Public Defender, the court appoints counsel to indigent 
individuals. 
 
Indigent defense services may be provided to individuals facing a felony 
charge, including hearings on charges of violation of felony probation at 
all critical stages of legal proceedings. Defense services may also be 
provided to indigent individuals facing a petition filed with a mental 
health board. Representation may also be provided to individuals charged 
with misdemeanor offenses punishable by imprisonment, if allowed by the 
court. The court determines indigence.

**********************************************

Nevada’s Office of the State Public Defender, located within the state’s 
Department of Health and Human Services, provides indigent defense 
services in counties with populations fewer than 100,000 or counties that 
do not have a county public defender office. Currently, the office serves 
only Carson City and White Pine County. The governor appoints the 
state public defender, who establishes branch offices and hires deputy 
public defenders to supervise these offices. The state provides 
representation at all stages of legal proceedings, including revocation 
of probation and parole, appeals, and post-conviction proceedings. The 
state public defender may contract with attorneys and with county public 
defenders to provide services. The state may charge and collect amounts 
from counties, as authorized by the state legislature for services. The 
state public defender reports annually to the governor and participating 
counties. 

Local administration
Nev. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 260.010 through 260.080
**********************************************

The boards of county commissioners in Clark and Washoe Counties must 
create an Office of the Public Defender by ordinance. Counties that have 
fewer than 100,000 in population may choose to establish an Office of the 
Public Defender. Additionally, multiple counties may choose to establish 
a joint office. Offices are run by a county public defender, who serves 
at the pleasure of the county board(s) of commissioners. An office 
provides services to defendants who have been placed under arrest and 
charged with a public offense. Counties provide representation at all 
stages of legal proceedings, including revocation of probation and 
parole, appeals, and post-conviction proceedings. The county public 
defender may, with approval by the county board of commissions, appoint 
deputy public defenders and staff. A county office may also contract for 
services of the state public defender. The magistrate or district court 
may also appoint an attorney outside of the public defender for 
representation to be paid by county funds, if deemed necessary by the 
court. A county public defender reports annually to the board of county 
commissioners.

In New Hampshire, a state public defender is completely state funded and 
provides primary representation in trial and appellate cases. The public 
defender program has nine regional offices, one administrative office, an 
appellate office, and a special defender office. An all-volunteer board 
of directors oversees the Public Defender Program. The board’s membership 
elects six directors, and the New Hampshire Bar Association’s Board of 
Governors appoints three directors. The public defender handles juvenile 
delinquency cases in local, district, and family courts, and adult 
clients in misdemeanor, felony, homicide, and capital cases in the 
district and superior courts, plus appellate advocacy in the state 
supreme court.

defendants in criminal cases who are formally charged with an indictable 
offense in all stages of the proceedings, juvenile delinquents, juveniles 
in need of supervision, representation of children in family matter 
issues, and individuals involuntary committed to state psychiatric 
facilities. The office is comprised of the following divisions and 
provides the following services:

* The Division of Administrative Services handles the business and 
financial matters of the office.

* The Appellate Section provides representation in appeals filed by 
adults and juveniles in lower court rulings in the state.

* The Office of Law Guardian provides representation and services to 
children in family court matters involving allegations of abuse and 
neglect, or in cases involving the termination of parental rights.

* The Office of Juvenile Services provides services to juvenile 
defendants in the state. 

* The Office of Parental Representation provides representation to 
parents involved in cases of alleged neglect or abuse of a child filed by 
the New Jersey Division of Youth and Family Services in family court. 

* The Special Hearings Unit provides mandated representation in Megan’s 
Law tier classification hearings for sex offenders. 

* The State’s Intensive Supervision Programs through the Administrative 
Office of the Courts provides representation at hearings designed to 
direct offenders from prison into community-based correctional programs.

* The Division of Mental Health Advocacy provides representation for 
hearings at federal, state, county, general, and private psychiatric 
hospitals. 

* The Office of Dispute Settlement provides mediation and arbitration 
services in the public interest.

The office is administered by the public defender, who is appointed by 
the governor with the advice and consent of the senate. The public 
defender may appoint deputy public defenders and assistant deputy public 
defenders as needed. To help provide indigent defense services, one 
regional office is currently located in each of the 21 counties in the 
state. Each regional office is headed by a deputy public defender, who 
supervises caseloads, maintains private attorney pools, and supervises 
reports to the Office of the Public Defender. Assistant deputy public 
defenders, those who try the cases, are assigned to each region based on 
the caseload in that county. The public defender must also maintain one 
or more trial pools of lawyers for services on a case-by-case basis. The 
case workload is divided among professional staff and the trial pool(s). 
If the caseload for staff and trial pool lawyers is full, the public 
defender may contract with private and public organizations to provide 
services. The public defender is also responsible for providing case 
statistics and financial records in an annual report to the state 
legislature, governor, and New Jersey Supreme Court.

New York’s criminal indigent defense system is primarily funded by its 
62 counties, which, by statute, may use a public defender program, 
conflict defender office, private legal aid society, or coordinated 
assigned counsel system to provide indigent defense services. Although 
the counties are primarily responsible for funding indigent defense 
services, the New York legislature created the Indigent Legal Services 
Fund (ILSF) to provide funding to counties and provide full funding for 
representation of children in dependency and delinquency cases. Funding 
for representation of adults in dependency cases is still the responsibility 
of the counties in the state. The ILSF helps pay for indigent defense 
expenditures in family court and helps the counties pay for all other 
indigent defense costs. State funding may not be used by counties or cities 
to replace local funding that would use funding for the indigent defense 
programs, but must be used to supplement local funds.

Office of Indigent Defense Services (est. 2000)
N.C. Gen. Stat.§ 7A-450 through 7A-499
**********************************************

North Carolina’s Office of Indigent Defense Services is located within 
the state’s judicial department. The office created 
the Commission on Indigent Defense, which consists of 
13 members: one member is appointed by the chief justice of the North 
Carolina Supreme Court, one member is appointed by the governor, one 
member is appointed the general assembly on recommendation of the 
president pro tempore of the state senate, one member is appointed by the 
general assembly on the recommendation of the speaker of the house of 
representatives, one member is appointed by the North Carolina Public 
Defenders Association, two members are appointed by the North Carolina 
State Bar, one member is appointed by the North Carolina Academy of Trial 
Lawyers, one member is appointed by the North Carolina Association of 
Black Lawyers, one member is appointed by the North Carolina Association 
of Women Lawyers, and three members are appointed by the commission. The 
commission helps to develop the standards for indigent defense services 
and operating standards for regional and district public defender offices 
and appellate defender offices. 

The state is divided into judicial districts, and the commission 
determines the methods for delivering services to indigent persons. 
Services may be provided by a system of appointed counsel, contract 
counsel, part-time public defenders, public defender offices, appellate 
defender services, and any other methods, including contracted counsel, 
or a combination of these methods. The commission consults with each district 
bar and judges to determine methods for a given district. In the 16 judicial 
districts where a public defender office has been established by the legislature,
 the commission appoints a public defender to run the day-to-day operations 
of the office. Public defenders are required to periodically report activities 
to the office. The state appropriates funds for these offices.
 

The commission is also responsible for appointing the director of the 
indigent defense services, who administers the office. Additionally, the 
director is responsible for preparing and submitting a budget to the 
commission and the general assembly. The budget of the office is part of 
the judicial department’s budget. The director is also responsible for 
administering the statewide sentencing services program, which provides 
the judicial system with information to assist in imposing sentences, 
helps provide increased opportunities for certain felons to makes 
restitutions through financial reimbursement or community services, and 
helps make the best and most effective use of resources. The director may 
award grants and adopt regulations for implementing, monitoring, and 
operating local sentencing services programs and administering funds 
appropriated by the general assembly. For the purposes of this report, 
the Sentencing Services Programs and funding is not included in data 
because it is not limited to convicted indigent individuals. 

The commission also appoints an appellate defender, a capital defender, 
and a juvenile defender. The appellate defender is responsible for 
providing representation to indigent persons following conviction in 
trial courts. The capital defender represents indigent persons who are 
charged with potentially capital offenses. The appellate defender, 
capital defender, and juvenile defender manage offices within the Office 
of Indigent Defense Services and may use contracted counsel to provide 
services.

Indigent defense services may be provided to a defendant in any case 
where imprisonment or a fine of $500 or more is likely to be adjudged; 
any case appealing a conviction of a felony, fine of $500 or more, or 
imprisonment; a hearing on a petition on the writ of habeas corpus; a 
hearing for revocation of probation; a hearing on extradition to another 
state; a proceeding for involuntary commitment to a facility for mental 
illness or substance abuse; any case involving an execution charge of 
civil arrest and bail proceeding; a hearing that may result in commitment 
to an institution or transfer to the superior court for trial on a felony 
charge for juveniles; a hearing for revocation of parole; a proceeding 
for the provision of protective services; cases involving a juvenile 
alleged to be abused, dependent, or neglected; a proceeding to find a 
person incompetent; a proceeding to terminate parental rights, where a 
guardian ad-litem is appointed; an action to terminate an indigent  
person’s parental rights; a proceeding involving consent for an abortion 
on an unemancipated minor; a proceeding involving limitation on freedom 
of movement or access; a proceeding involving placement into satellite 
monitoring; or outpatient involuntary commitment proceedings.

§ 54-61-01 through 54-61-04
**********************************************

In 2005, North Dakota ratified legislation to reform the state’s indigent 
defense system. The new system features a seven-member Commission on 
Legal Counsel for Indigents, which is responsible for overseeing the 
complex process of delivering state-funded legal counsel services for 
indigents. Members of the commission include two members appointed by the 
governor, one of whom must be appointed from a county with a population 
of not more than 10,000 residents; two members of the legislative 
assembly, one from each house, appointed by the chairman of the 
legislative management; two members appointed by the chief justice of the 
North Dakota Supreme Court, one of whom must be appointed from a county 
with a population of not more than 10,000 residents; and one member 
appointed by the board of governors of the State Bar Association of North 
Dakota. 

The North Dakota Commission on Legal Counsel maintains six full-time 
public defender offices. In each office, a supervising attorney takes 
criminal and juvenile assignments from the court staff. Those cases are 
assigned first to the public defenders, and then to conflict counsel, who 
are area attorneys that have contracted with the agency to provide case-
by-case service, or by attorneys who have contracted for monthly conflict 
services. Private contractors provide indigent defense services in areas 
where there is no public defender or in conflict cases.

The Ohio Public Defender Commission is responsible for supervising and 
establishing standards of indigent defense services in the state. The 
commission appoints a state public defender to serve at its pleasure. The 
state public defender, when designated by the court or requested by a 
county public defender or joint county public defender, may provide legal 
representation to indigent defendants throughout the state. Additionally, 
the state public defender maintains financial records, appoints assistant 
public defenders, and supervises local defenders. The state public 
defender uses funds from the Civil Case Filing Fee Fund in the state 
treasury to appoint assistant public defenders, and for personnel, 
equipment, and facilities for the Office of the State Public Defender. 
The commission is responsible for submitting an annual report on the 
operations of the State Public Defender’s Office, the county-appointed 
counsel systems, and the county and joint county public defender offices.  

Local administration
ORC Ann. § 120.13 through 120.41
**********************************************

The county commissioners may establish a county public defender 
commission. The commission, consisting of five members appointed by the 
board of county commissioners and the judge or presiding judge of the 
court of common pleas of a county, appoints the county public defender. 
Representation may be provided to indigent adults or juveniles charged 
with an offense or act that violates state statute and which there is a 
penalty or possible adjudication that includes potential loss of liberty, 
and in post-conviction proceedings. A court may choose to appoint counsel 
other than the county public defender. The office of county public 
defender recommends an annual operating budget, which requires approval 
from the county commissioners. The county public defender may contract 
with the state public defender or one or more nonprofit organizations to 
provide indigent defense services. Additionally, a county public defender 
may contract with any municipal corporation within the county served by 
the county public defender to provide legal representation to indigent 
persons charged with violating an ordinance of the municipal corporation, 
at the cost of said municipal corporation. Counties may request that the 
state public defender reimburse 50% of a county public defender’s office 
operating expenses. A county public defender reports to both the county 
commissioners and the Ohio Public Defender Commission. 

The boards of county commissioners in two or more adjoining or 
neighboring counties may form a joint county public defender commission. 
The establishing agreement determines the allocation of expenses to be 
paid by each participating county. Joint county public defender 
commissions operate under similar laws as a single county public defender 
commission.

The board of county commissioners of any county may adopt a resolution to 
pay counsel who are either personally selected by an indigent defendant 
or appointed by the court, as opposed to using a county public defender 
or joint county public defender. The county auditor is responsible for 
reporting expenses to the board of county commissioners and the state 
public defender. A county may request reimbursements for defense services 
from the state public defender. 

A County Representation Fund in the state treasury consists of monies 
from counties for any legal services provided by the state public 
defender, when designated by the court or requested by a county or joint 
county public defender. 

The total amount of money paid to all counties in any fiscal year for 
reimbursement of a percentage of the counties’ cost of operating county 
public defender offices, joint county public defender offices, and 
county-appointed counsel systems cannot exceed the amount appropriated by 
the state general assembly. If the amount appropriated by the general 
assembly is insufficient to cover 50% of total operating costs, the 
percentage will be reduced proportionately so that each county is 
reimbursed an equal percentage of its indigent defense system costs. 
Funds appropriated by the general assembly for this purpose are placed in 
the Indigent Defense Support Fund in the state treasury. 

Census Bureau data available were available for Cuyahoga County.

established an Office of Public Defense Services (OPDS), which has two 
main divisions: the Contract and Business Services (CBS) and the 
appellate division. The commission consists of seven members appointed by 
order of the chief justice. In addition to the seven appointed members, 
the chief justice serves as a nonvoting, ex officio member, and appoints 
at least two persons who are not bar members, at least one person who is 
a bar member and who is engaged in criminal defense representation, and 
at least one person who is a former Oregon state prosecutor. A member may 
not serve concurrently as a judge, a prosecuting attorney, or an employee 
of a law enforcement agency. A person who is primarily engaged in 
providing public defense services also may not serve as a member of the 
commission.

Oregon’s statewide indigent defense program is responsible for numerous 
types of cases, including termination of parental rights, dependency 
(adults and juveniles), civil commitment, Psychiatric Security Review 
Board, child support contempt, felonies, misdemeanors, juvenile 
delinquency, appeals, and habeas corpus petitions. As of July 2003, the 
commission assumed all duties and services of the Indigent Defense 
Services Division (IDSD) of the State Court Administrator’s Office. These 
services include administration of county contracts for all indigent 
defense representation (trial and appellate, except those cases that the 
state appellate office handles) in Oregon’s state courts.

The Public Defender Act of 1968 (P.L. 1144, No. 358, Section 1) provides 
for the establishment of a public defender in each of the counties in the 
State of Pennsylvania. The public defender is appointed by the Board of 
County Commissioners in each county and represents qualified individuals 
in juvenile delinquency proceedings, adult criminal trials, appellate 
proceedings, post-conviction appeals, and probation and parole 
proceedings. The State of Pennsylvania does not provide any funding of 
the public defenders, leaving financial responsibility to each of the 
counties. An effort by the Task Force and Advisory Commission on Services 
to Indigent Criminal Defendants has been undertaken to create a statewide 
commission to assist with indigent defense programs in the state, but no 
legislation has been enacted. A centralized external location to collect

defender. A circuit public defender is responsible for supervising 
assistant public defenders, maintaining financial and case records, 
establishing a juvenile offender division, and submitting a proposed 
budget to the Commission on Indigent Defense. The circuit public defender 
hires assistant public defenders and other personnel, who are considered 
employees of the administrating county. The employees of the circuit 
public defender are paid by the administering county. 

The circuit public defender may also contract with attorneys to provide 
indigent defense services. Counties receive state appropriations and 
reimbursements that cover part of the costs of indigent defense services, 
with remaining costs appropriated from county funds.

Counties in South Dakota may opt to participate in a catastrophic 
indigent defense fund. The County Commissioners’ Association administers 
the fund, and the fund acts as insurance against small counties’ 
extraordinary costs for complex cases, such as death penalty cases, that 
may occur in their jurisdictions. The State of South Dakota provides very 
little funding to the counties for public defender programs. A

investigates each case and the legal process that resulted in the 
original capital conviction and sentence. OPCD also assists other capital 
defense attorneys in the state through noncase-specific advice and 
training programs. A nine-member Oversight Commission, appointed by the 
governor, the lieutenant governor, and the speaker of the house, is 
responsible for choosing the director and assists the office in each 
year’s budgetary process. Two counties, Shelby and Davidson Counties,

Texas Health & Safety Code 841.005
**********************************************

The Office of State Counsel for Offenders represents indigent defenders 
who are incarcerated in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice with 
counsel. The office consists of five legal sections: 

* Trial
* Immigration
* General Legal
* Civil Commitment
* Appellate.

Local administration
Texas Code Crim. Proc. 26.044; 26.047 
through 78.056
**********************************************

The Texas Fair Defense Act (FDA) was passed by the Texas Legislature in 
2001, which required all criminal courts to adopt formal practices for 
providing indigent defense services in the state. The act helped provide 
uniformity and statewide procedures. Counties are allowed to determine a 
plan individually or among two or more counties for the method of 
providing indigent defense services, including a managed assigned counsel 
program, contract counsel, a public defender program, or some combination 
of these methods. The commissioners court of any county, on written 
approval of a judge of a county court, statutory county court, or 
district court trying certain cases, may create a department of the 
county or designate a nonprofit corporation to serve as a public 
defender’s office. The commissioners’ courts of two or more counties may 
enter into a written agreement to jointly create or designate and jointly 
fund a regional public defender’s office. The commissioners’ court(s) 
appropriate funds for a such an office. 

Services may be provided to defendants in criminal matters or in any 
adversary, judicial proceeding that may result in punishment by 
confinement, juvenile offenses, or if the court determines representation 
is required in the interest of justice. Services may also be provided in 
certain appellate and post-conviction habeas corpus matters. The state 
provides some appropriations for indigent defense services, but the 
majority of funds are provided locally. 

Census Bureau data was available for three counties: Bexar, Dallas, and 
Harris Counties. Census data for Harris County was only available for FY 
2011 and appear to be for a public defender pilot program.

Local administration
Utah Code Ann. § 77-32-101
**********************************************

Traditionally, indigent defense programs have received no funding from 
the state. However, funding has changed slightly in recent years. 
Counties in Utah depend on numerous models of indigent defense delivery 
systems. Some counties have public defender offices, while other counties 
in the state contract with individual attorneys or use assigned counsel 
to provide indigent representation similar to other states that provide 
county-run indigent defense services.

Post Conviction Indigent Defense Fund
Utah Code Ann. § 77-32-701
**********************************************

The only funding for indigent defense services from the State of Utah 
comes from the Post Conviction Indigent Defense Fund, which provides 
funding for persons convicted of a capital crime and sentenced to death 
to challenge the conviction and have counsel appointed. If a defendant 
requests counsel and is determined by the court to be indigent, costs of 
counsel and other reasonable litigation expenses incurred in providing 
the representation are paid from the state fund.

Office of the Defender General (est. 1972)
13 V.S.A. § 5201 through 5277
**********************************************

The state’s general assembly funds the Office of the Defender General to 
provide indigent defense services statewide. An appointed defender 
general administers the office and may establish a public defender office 
to determine how indigent defense services may be provided. Indigent 
defense services may be provided in a number of ways, including 
personally by the appointed defender general, employed public defenders, 
or contracted attorneys.
 
Clerical and office staff of the Office of the Defender General and in 
all local offices are considered state employees and are therefore paid 
by the state. The office’s budget must be adopted by the general 
assembly. On rare occasions, the governor and the state treasurer may 
approve additional funds from the contingent fund after a budget has been 
adopted. 
 
The defender general is required to submit an annual report to the 
state’s house and senate judiciary committees on activities, including 
the number of individuals represented, crimes involved, outcome, and the 
expenditures of the office required to fulfill its obligations.

Virginia 
***************

Virginia Indigent Defense Commission (est. 2004)
Va. Code Ann. § 19.2-163.01
**********************************************

The Virginia Indigent Defense Commission is responsible for overseeing 
indigent defense services in the Commonwealth. The commission consists of 
14 members: the chairmen of the state’s house and senate committees for 
courts of justice, the chairman of the Virginia State Crime Commission, 
the executive secretary of the Virginia Supreme Court, two attorneys 
officially designated by the Virginia State Bar, two members appointed by 
the governor, three members appointed by the speaker of the house of 
delegates, and three members appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules. 
Indigent defense services may be provided to an individual charged with a 
criminal offense punishable by death or confinement in a state 
correctional facility or jail.  

The commission is responsible for maintaining public defender and 
regional capital defender offices that are established by the state 
general assembly. The commission is also responsible for hiring an 
executive director, who in turn may, with the commission’s approval, 
appoint public or capital defenders to established offices. The executive 
director is responsible for fixing compensation for public defenders and 
other personnel in each public defender office, subject to approval of 
the commission. The commission must approve requests for appropriations, 
and receives and expends money appropriated by the general assembly. The 
governing body of any city or county may supplement compensation of the 
public defender above the amount fixed by the executive director. The 
commission also maintains a list of attorneys who may serve as court-
appointed counsel for indigent defendants, in addition to public 
defenders.

The Virginia Indigent Defense Commission does not directly pay assigned 
council vouchers. These vouchers are paid directly by the Virginia State 
Supreme Court. As of this writing, the U.S. Census Bureau was unable 
to obtain exact figures from the state for these vouchers.

Washington
***************

Office of Public Defense (est. 1996)
Wash. Rev. Code § 2.70.005 through 2.70.900
**********************************************

In Washington, public defense is provided by the Office of Public Defense 
(OPD) as an agency of the judicial branch, permanently authorized by the 
state legislature in 1996. OPD administers state funds appropriated for 
trial court criminal indigent defense, appellate indigent defense, 
representation of indigent parents qualified for appointed counsel in 
dependency and termination cases, extraordinary criminal justice cost 
petitions, compilation of copies of DNA test requests by persons 
convicted of felonies, and representation of indigent respondents 
qualified for appointed counsel in sexually violent predator civil 
commitment cases. 

Local administration
**********************************************

At the trial court level in the State of Washington, public defense is 
provided within local county and city systems. The counties and cities in 
Washington provide the majority of the funding of public defender 
programs, while the state provides a small amount of funding on these 
programs.

Local expenditures for public defender programs in the State of 
Washington were provided for King County through the data queries for the 
Annual Survey of Local Government Finances.

West Virginia
***************

Public Defender Services (est. 1989)
W. Va. Code § 29-21-1 through 29-21-21
**********************************************

West Virginia Public Defender Services (PDS) administers, coordinates, 
and evaluates local indigent defense programs in the state’s 31 judicial 
districts. The PDS provides indigent defense in two ways: public defender 
corporations and private appointed counsel. Public defender corporations 
are in charge of indigent defense programs in their individual judicial 
districts. Each office has almost complete local administrative control 
over its jurisdiction, but remains completely state funded. The PDS pays 
for all private counsel salaries and their expenses. However, local 
judges maintain almost complete control over this aspect of the indigent 
defense system by the appointing counsel.

Indigent Defense Commission
W. Va. Code § 29-21-3b
**********************************************

In 2008, the Indigent Defense Commission was established, with a board of 
directors consisting of one former or retired circuit judge; three 
lawyers, one from each congressional district, who have significant 
experience in the defense of criminal cases or have demonstrated a strong 
commitment to quality representation of indigent defendants; one current 
chief public defender; and one non-attorney with a demonstrated 
commitment to providing legal services to the indigent; one person who is 
a member of an organization that advocates on behalf of people with 
mental illness and developmental disabilities; and one attorney with 
significant experience in the defense of juvenile delinquency and abuse 
and neglect cases. With the new Indigent Defense Commission, additional 
oversight of the highly localized indigent defense system in West 
Virginia is provided. The commission is in charge of creating new public 
defender offices and integrating or dissolving existing public defender 
corporations. 

***************
Wisconsin
***************

Office of the State Public Defender (est. 1977)
Wis. Stat. § 977.01 through 977.09
**********************************************

In Wisconsin, the state public defender system has regional offices that 
provide trial and appellate representation through the Office of the 
State Public Defender (SPD). The Public Defender Board, which consists of 
nine members selected by the governor and confirmed by the state senate, 
appoints the state public defender to supervise the operation, 
activities, policies, and procedures of the SPD.
 
The SPD is organized into four divisions: 

* The Trial Division provides legal representation to eligible persons 
charged with adult crimes or juvenile offenses punishable by 
imprisonment; facing involuntary commitment; involved in certain family 
disputes, such as termination of parental rights; or subject to a 
revocation hearing in which incarceration is sought.

* The Appellate Division provides assistance to indigents involved in 
appeals, including post-conviction and post-commitment proceedings.

* The Administrative Division is responsible for providing staff support 
services in areas, such as human resources, payroll, budget preparation 
and analysis, accounting and purchasing, and collections and 
verification.

* The Assigned Counsel Division oversees certification, appointment, and 
payment of private attorneys who represent SPD clients. 

Three offices are also located in the state: legal counsel, training and 
development, and information technology. Thirty-eight field offices, 36 
of which are trial-level offices, provide representation in every county 
in Wisconsin. The majority of the funding of public defender programs is 
paid for by the State of Wisconsin, while counties in the state provide a 
small amount of funding on these programs.

***************
Wyoming
***************

Office of the State Public Defender (est. 1977)
Wyo. Stat. Ann. § 7-6-101 through 7-6-114
**********************************************

Wyoming’s Office of the State Public Defender provides assistance counsel 
to indigent adult criminal and juvenile delinquency trial and appellate 
cases in circuit, district, and juvenile courts. The public defender 
ensures the protection of due process rights for clients at all stages of 
a criminal proceeding by informing, advising, advocating, and negotiating 
on behalf of the client. In all stages of a criminal case, the public 
defender provides representation for clients, including attempts to 
resolve cases through fair plea negotiations. Fifteen offices are located 
throughout the state, including one main office and 14 field offices 
handling indigent defense cases in one or more counties. The Office of 
the State Public Defender acts as a separate operating agency under the 
executive branch of the state government. The State of Wyoming is 
responsible for 85% of the total cost of the state public defender 
program, and the counties contribute the remaining 15% of the total cost.

Appendix A: Comparing Census Bureau 
data to external sources
**********************************************

To ensure the accuracy of data presented from the Annual State Government 
Finance Survey, the Census Bureau compared these data to information 
provided by external sources, including state budgets, comprehensive 
annual financial reports, agency reports, and appropriation bills. 
Amounts reported by the Census Bureau were compared to actual amounts, 
when available. Appropriated amounts were consulted when actual amounts 
were unavailable.

Fiscal year 2011 was analyzed to determine the cause of expenditure 
differences between external reports and Census Bureau data, if any. 
Using 2011 data provided an opportunity for any revisions to be 
incorporated in Census Bureau data. In addition, 2011 provides a more 
recent view of what can be anticipated in terms of organization and 
accounting structure in the future, rather than previous years.

Based on FY 2011, the following results were found:***Footnote 4 For the 
State of Hawaii, data from FY 2012 were used for external comparison 
because FY 2011 external data were unavailable.***

* 23 states had a percentage difference of 1.0% or less. ***Footnote 5 
To find the difference, the Census Bureau’s amount was subtracted from 
the external source. The percentage difference is the absolute value of 
the difference as a percentage of the external source.*** 

* 10 states had a percentage difference between 1.0% and 5.0%.

* 6 states had a percentage difference between 5.0% and 10.0%.

* 4 states had a percentage difference between 10.0% and 20.0%.

* 3 states had a percentage difference greater than 20.0%.

* 4 states and the District of Columbia were not applicable to the 
external source comparison.***Footnote 6 Excludes California, 
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Utah. For more information, see 
explanations for each state in this appendix. Also excludes the District 
of Columbia because its indigent defense services are federally 
funded.***

Detailed explanations for each state are included in this appendix. Three 
common reasons were determined to be the cause of expenditure differences 
between Census Bureau data and external sources:

* comparing actual amounts to appropriated amounts

* excluding employer contributions to pension systems at the agency level
storing data for the Annual Survey of State Government Finances in 
thousands of dollars.

Comparing actual expenditures to appropriated amounts in an external 
source can lead to a larger difference, though this was not always the 
case. Agencies may not always expend everything that is appropriated in 
the fiscal year, or  additional carryover from a prior fiscal year could 
be used for expenditures. For the majority of comparisons, the external 
amount tended to be greater than the Census Bureau amount. Cases in which 
the opposite result occurred are noted.

Certain states have central agencies that expend the state’s employer 
contributions into its pension systems. In these situations, the detail 
explaining to which functional agency those employer contributions were 
assigned is nonexistent. As a result, seven states that expend employer 
contributions into pension systems are excluded in Census Bureau 
expenditure amounts.

Census Bureau data for state government finances are stored in the 
database in thousands of dollars. Due to rounding procedures set up in 
the processing system, some amounts may be rounded up, rounded down, or 
lost (e.g., if the amount of the expenditure line item is less than 
$500). Depending on the amount of expenditure line items in the database 
for the agency providing indigent defense services, this rounding effect 
can have a minimal impact or a large impact (e.g., a state agency that 
has over 500 lines of expenditures). A future solution would be to pull 
the data from the raw data files provided by the state governments. 
However, a small number of states provide data in thousands of dollars.

The following sections of this appendix provide a state-by-state 
discussion of the differences between Census Bureau data and the external 
sources used for comparison. See appendix table 2 for a summary of the 
external sources used, appropriated versus actual external amounts, 
whether benefits were included in the data, and the FY 2011 percentage 
differences. In certain instances, state data in other fiscal years 
exhibited a large difference between Census Bureau data and the external 
sources. Those notable disparities are discussed below, if applicable.

***************
Alabama
***************

Census Bureau data included retirement benefits. The external source was 
the state’s executive budget document, which provided appropriated 
amounts. The external source total was only the sum of the Fair Trial Tax 
Transfer and indigent defense activity within the Alabama Department of 
Finance, and did not clearly exhibit the expenditures for the money spent 
within the Fair Trial Tax Fund.

Appendix A: Comparing Census Bureau data to external sources (continued)
The total difference between the two sources was $25 million, or 62.22%. 
However, the majority of the difference could be contributed to the 
missing expenditures of the Fair Trial Tax Fund. The difference for the 
indigent defense activity within the state’s Department of Finance was 
$1,000, or 0.9%. The amounts for the Fair Trial Tax Transfer were equal.
The budget was organized by fund, not necessarily the activity in 
question. Given the areas available for comparison, the amounts pulled 
from Census Bureau data are accurate.

***************
Alaska
***************

Census Bureau data for Public Defender Agency expenditures included 
retirement benefits. The external source was the Governor’s Operating 
Budget, which provided actual expenditures from prior fiscal years. The 
difference between the two sources was $138,000, or 0.60%. This 
difference could be largely attributed to rounding effects, given that 94 
expenditure lines were included in fiscal year 2011 data.


***************
Arizona
***************

While the majority of spending for indigent defense is in the counties, 
three state programs spend money on indigent defense: the State Aid to 
Indigent Defense Fund, the State Capital Postconviction Public Defender 
Office, and the County Public Defender Training Fund. Retirement benefits 
were included in Census Bureau data, but it was a small amount because 
the majority of expenditures at the state level were intergovernmental 
aid. Actual amounts were available in the Governor’s Budget - Agency 
Detail Book. Separate amounts for each state program were provided.

The total difference between Census Bureau data and the external source 
was $56,000, or 2.67%. The State Aid to Indigent Defense Fund was equal 
in both sources. The largest difference came from the County Public 
Defender Training Fund, which was a 9.60% difference. The cause of the 
difference between the two sources was due to rounding.


***************
Arkansas
***************

The majority of expenditures were from the state’s Public Defender 
Commission; however, in conflict cases, the expenditures came from the 
Arkansas Supreme Court, Arkansas Administrative Office of the Courts, and 
Arkansas Court of Appeals. Retirement benefits were included in Census 
Bureau data at the agency level. The external source was the State 
Budget, which provided actual expenditures at the agency level. As a 
result, expenditures from the state supreme court, administrative office 
of the courts, and the court of appeals could be extracted from the 
external source.

Comparing expenditures from only the Public Defender Commission, the 
difference between Census Bureau data and the external source was 
$217,000, or 1.01%. This difference is related to rounding issues and 
possible accounting adjustments that were consciously excluded from the 
database query.

***************
California
***************

California is the only state for which the Census Bureau does not receive 
an electronic source. As a result, expenditures for this state were 
compiled using the State of California Governor’s Budget, which would 
have been the external source used for comparison. Because this external 
source was consulted for data, no differences exist between the two data 
sources.

Expenditures for the California Appellate Project were not available in 
the Governor’s Budget. This program was primarily funded by contract 
through the Judicial Council of California. While expenditures for the 
council were available in the budget document, the expenditures were 
broken out by fund detail and not the program. Because of the lack of 
program detail, the contract expenditures for the California Appellate 
Project were unavailable.

***************
Colorado
***************

Four agencies are responsible for some portion of indigent defense for 
the state: the Office of Dispute Resolution, the Office of the State 
Public Defender, the Office of the Alternate Defense Counsel, and the 
Office of the Child’s Representative. Census Bureau data for each agency 
included retirement benefits. The external source was the Staff Budget 
Briefing for the Judicial Branch and included actual amounts for the 
State Public Defender Office, Alternate Defense Counsel Office, and 
Child’s Representative Office. The external source excluded amounts for 
the Office of Dispute Resolution. Census Bureau data for the Office of 
Dispute Resolution was $218,000 out of the $90.9 million expenditure 
total.

Comparing the expenditures from the available agencies, the difference 
between the two sources was $96,000, or 0.10%. For the State Public 
Defender Office, the difference was 0.50%. For the Alternate Defense 
Counsel Office, the difference was 0.01%. For the Child’s Representative 
Office, the difference was 0.06%.

***************
Connecticut
***************

Data for the Public Defender Services Commission were available in Census 
Bureau data, with pension payments included. The external source was the 
Annual Report of the Chief Public Defender, which provided actual 
expenditures for the commission. 
The difference between the two sources of data was $8,000, or 0.02%. The 
difference is attributed to rounding issues.

***************
Delaware
***************

Indigent defense in the state is funded and run by the state’s Office of 
the Public Defender. Census Bureau data included pension payments for the 
office. The external source was an appropriation bill passed by the state 
senate that breaks out specific appropriations for the office.

Even with this appropriated amount, the expenditures of the two sources 
were close. The difference was $477,000, or 3.28%. The raw data file was 
analyzed to determine whether rounding was an issue. When the original 
difference between the two sources was analyzed, Census Bureau data was 
$478,000 greater than the appropriated amount. When the raw data file was 
analyzed in whole dollar amounts, the Census Bureau data was $74,000 less 
than the appropriated amount. This is a 0.51% difference.

***************
Florida
***************

A majority of the expenditures in Census Bureau data were found in the 
Justice Administrative Commission. Benefit payments were included in the 
database query, which yielded over 1,000 lines of expenditures for 
indigent defense. The external source was the enacted budget for each 
fiscal year. For fiscal year 2011, this was the Laws of Florida, Chapter 
2010-152.

Appropriations in the budget provided more detailed information. Some 
items in the budget were rolled up into something excluded in the Census 
detail. The difference between the two sources was $133.6 million, or 
38.78% (the appropriations were greater). The difference could be a 
result of other items excluded in the query (e.g., transfers and 
refunds), rounding issues, and comparing actual expenditures to 
appropriated amounts.

More reconciliation work needs to be done for Florida. The Census Bureau 
will continue to look into the discrepancies once this report is 
submitted.


***************
Georgia
***************

The Georgia Public Defender Standards Council oversees indigent defense 
in the state. The agency was available in the Census Bureau data and 
included retirement benefits at the function level. The external source 
was the Budgetary Compliance Report, which provided actual amounts for 
each fiscal year. The difference between the two sources was $9,000, or 
0.01%.

Census Bureau data for 2008 and 2010 were abnormally lower than the 
external source and the remainder of the data series. Analysis of the raw 
data file revealed that the file received from the state did not provide 
reliable amounts for certain expenditure lines. This data agreement with 
the state has since been renegotiated, and the data abnormalities have 
been fixed. Given that the external source and the reliable years of data 
were so close, the final data table included external data for total 
expenditures in fiscal years 2008 and 2010. The external source did not 
separate intergovernmental and direct expenditures, so those data were 
not available for 2008 and 2010.

***************
Hawaii
***************

Hawaii’s Office of the Public Defender data were available in the Census 
Bureau data. However, retirement benefit payments for the state were in a 
central location for the entire Department of Budget and Finance, so 
these payments were excluded in indigent defense expenditures. The 
external source was the Executive Biennium Budget, which provided 
appropriated amounts for both current and historical years.

A recent website redesign has left the 2009 to 2011 biennium budget 
unavailable, even in archived web pages. This means for fiscal years 2010 
and 2011, no external source was available for comparison. In this state, 
fiscal year 2012 was used for comparison. The difference between the two 
sources in 2012 was $518,000, or 5.29%. The combination of comparing 
actual amounts to appropriated amounts, and excluding retirement benefits 
could have contributed to the difference.

***************
Idaho
***************

While indigent defense services are mainly provided by the county, the 
state has an Office of the Appellate Public Defender. This agency’s 
expenditures were available in the Census Bureau data and provided 
retirement benefits at the function level. The external source was the 
Legislative Fiscal Report for the agency, which showed actual amounts for 
prior fiscal years.

The difference between the two sources was $3,000, or 0.15%. This 
difference could be attributed to rounding, as the raw data file was 
delivered in whole dollars.

***************
Illinois
***************

At the trial level, indigent defense is mainly county run and funded, but 
the Office of the State Appellate Defender within the state government 
represents indigent defendants on appeal. Census Bureau data for the 
office included retirement benefit contributions. The external source was 
the state budget, which showed actual amounts for each year. The 
difference between the two sources was $3,000, or 0.01%.

***************
Indiana
***************

Indigent defense services are provided, in part, from the state 
government through three agencies: the Office of the State Public 
Defender, the State Public Defender Council, and the Public Defender 
Commission. All agency data were available through the Census Bureau 
data, but retirement contributions were provided by a central agency for 
the state and were not included in the final data.

Two different external sources were used for comparison: the As-Passed 
Budget Expenditure Summary, which contained actual expenditure amounts 
for the Office of the State Public Defender and the State Public Defender 
Council; and the Annual Report of the Indiana Public Defender Commission, 
which provided actual expenditure amounts for the Public Defender 
Commission.***Footnote 7 The external data for FY 2008 was displayed in 
the external report for the commission as FY 2006–2007. Because the data 
in the 2008 report do not match the 2007 report, this is assumed to be a 
typo within the report and was taken as the 2008 data.***

The total difference between the two sources was $34,000, or 0.14%. For 
the Public Defender Council, the difference was 1.66%; for the Office of 
the State Public Defender, the difference was 1.04%; and for the Public 
Defender Commission, the difference was 0.07%.

***************
Iowa
***************

Data for the Office of the State Public Defender were available in the 
Census Bureau data and included retirement benefits. The external source 
was the Agency Operating Budget, which provided actual expenditure 
amounts for prior years.

The difference between the two sources was $3.1 million, or 5.39%. The 
external amount included expenditure line items for reversions and 
depreciation, which were excluded in Census Bureau data as they were not 
actual cash transactions expended in the fiscal year. Removing these two 
items from the external source amount would bring the difference to about 
$1 million.

***************
Kansas
***************

Indigent defense in felony cases is handled by the State Board of 
Indigents’ Defense Services. Census Bureau data provided all of the 
agency detail, including employer pension contributions. The external 
data source was the Governor’s Budget Report, which provided actual 
amounts for prior fiscal years.

The difference between the sources was $467,000, or 2.01%, and could be 
attributed to the system rounding from actuals provided in the raw data 
file. The agency had almost 180 expenditure lines.

***************
Kentucky
***************

The Department of Public Advocacy is primarily state funded, but some 
funds come from county governments. Census Bureau data included both 
state and county expenditures and employer pension contributions. The 
external source was the state budget, which provided appropriated 
amounts. The difference between the two sources was $6,000, or 0.01%.

***************
Louisiana
***************

Louisiana’s indigent defense services are administered by the Louisiana 
Public Defender Board, which oversees and funds all 42 judicial districts 
in the state. Census Bureau data pulled from the database query provided 
only expenditures (including retirement benefits) from the board and not 
those of the 42 judicial districts, as the state considers them to be 
local governments.*** Footnote 8 According to Census Bureau 
classification, the judicial districts in Louisiana are classified as 
dependent agencies of the state.*** The board’s website provided the 
current year’s annual report, which contained actual expenditures for the 
board and 42 judicial districts. This report was only available for 
fiscal years 2010 through 2012. The external source for fiscal years 2008 
and 2009 was the state budget, which provided appropriated amounts.

The difference between Census Bureau data and the board’s expenditures in 
the annual report was $2,000, or 0.01%, which could be attributed to 
rounding. 

Because the initial database query excluded expenditures from the 
judicial districts, amounts from the annual report for district spending 
were included for the state expenditures in the data table for fiscal 
years 2010 through 2012. This was also the method for capturing these 
expenditures in the Census Bureau’s survey.


***************
Maine
***************

The Maine Commission on Indigent Legal Services began operations in 
fiscal year 2011. Prior to that, the Judicial Department administered the 
funds for indigent defense services. Census Bureau data contained both 
the data for the commission and the services provided by the Judicial 
Department of the state. Pension contributions were included for the 
commission. However, pension contributions for the Judicial Department 
were provided as one sum for the department, so contributions for only 
those employees providing the indigent defense services were unavailable.

For fiscal years 2008 through 2010, the Maine Judicial Branch provided 
its indigent defense expenditures in its annual report. After the 
creation of the commission, that expenditure detail was no longer 
provided in the Judicial Department. The commission’s actual expenditures 
were provided in the state’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report for 
fiscal years 2011 through 2012. These expenditures were used for 
comparison. The difference between the two sources for the commission’s 
expenditures was $2,000, or 0.02%.

***************
Maryland
***************

The Office of the Public Defender provides indigent defense services in 
the state. The agency’s expenditures were available with pension 
contributions in the Census Bureau data. The external source was the 
Judicial and Legal Review Budget, which provided actual amounts. The 
difference between the two sources was $101,000, or 0.12%, and could be 
attributed to rounding issues, as the query pulled about 150 expenditure 
line items.

***************
Massachusetts
***************

Expenditures for the Committee for Public Counsel were available in the 
Census Bureau data, but benefit payments at the agency level were not 
provided. Two centralized agencies paid health and life insurance 
benefits and retirement allowances for state employees. The external 
source was the Governor’s Budget, which provided actual amounts for prior 
years. The difference between the two sources was $328,000, or 0.17%.

***************
Michigan
***************

While indigent defense services are mainly county run and funded, the 
state operates an Appellate Defender Commission. The commission’s 
expenditures were available with pension contributions in the Census 
Bureau data. The external source was the State Executive Summary, which 
provided recommended appropriations for each fiscal year. External 
appropriations for fiscal year 2012 were unavailable due to changes in 
the presentation of the budget, in which all appropriations were grouped 
into “Judicial Operations.”

The difference between the two sources was $2.3 million, or 15.17%. The 
comparison was made based on recommended appropriated amounts, not actual 
appropriations or actual expenditures. Also, the appropriation line item 
in the budget was “Indigent Defense & Judicial Agencies.” Given this, the 
budget line may have included additional expenditures that should not 
have been included. However, without any additional information, this 
remain unknown. After a thorough review, it was determined that Census 
Bureau data were not missing anything, but it was difficult to compare 
line item expenditures to a singular line in an appropriations budget.

***************
Minnesota
***************

The State Board of Public Defense expenditures were available in the 
Census Bureau data. However, employer contribution toward pension 
benefits were shown under a central agency and were not available at an 
agency level. The external source was the Agency Profile in the State 
Budget. 

The difference between the two sources was 1.2 million, 
or 1.8%. This could be a result of the mission pension 
expenditures.

***************
Mississippi
***************


While the majority of indigent defense expenditures in the state are with 
county governments, three state agencies provide indigent defense 
services: the Post-Conviction Counsel, the Capital Defense Counsel, and 
the Office of Indigent Appeals. Expenditures for all three agencies, 
including retirement benefits, were found in Census Bureau data. The 
external source for the three state agencies was the State Budget, which 
provided appropriated amounts.

The difference between the two sources was $891,000, or 19.92%. After a 
thorough review, it was determined that the Census Bureau data were not 
missing any expenditures.  The difference could be a result of comparing 
actual expenditures provided by the state to appropriated amounts in a 
budget.

***************
Missouri
***************

The state has a Public Defender Commission that provides a statewide, 
centrally administered public defender system. Census Bureau data 
provided expenditures for the commission. However, employer pension 
contributions came from a centralized agency. The external source was the 
Office Financial Summary, which showed actual expenditures.

The difference between the two sources was $88,000, or 0.24%, and could 
be the result of rounding issues and the exclusion of retirement 
benefits.

***************
Montana

***************

Census Bureau data provided the expenditures of the Office of the State 
Public Defender. The line items showed expenditures for the centralized 
administration of the agency and each regional office’s expenditures, 
including retirement benefits. The external source was the state’s Public 
Defender Commission’s Report to the Governor, Legislature, and Supreme 
Court, which showed actual expenditures for each of the 11 regions in the 
state.

The difference between the two sources was $1.1 million (Census Bureau 
data were greater), or 5.61%. The difference could be attributed to the 
external source not showing the centralized expenditures and only showing 
those of the regional offices.

***************
Nebraska
***************

Expenditures for the Commission on Public Advocacy were included, with 
retirement benefits, in the Census Bureau data. The external source was 
the state’s Executive Budget in Brief, which provided actual amounts for 
each year.

The difference between the two sources was $3,000, or 0.08%, which could 
be more than likely attributed to rounding differences, as 31 expenditure 
line items were included. 

***************
Nevada
***************

While the counties run and fund the majority of indigent defense services 
in the state, the State Public Defender expends some money. These 
expenditures, including retirement benefits, were included in Census 
Bureau data. The external source was the Executive Biennial Budget. 
Because the budget is released every 2 years, only 3 years out of the 6 
produced an actual amount for comparison (the even numbered years). The 
odd numbered years were presented as an adjusted appropriation amount.

Given that fiscal year 2011 was the year of this analysis, the external 
amount was a suggested appropriation amount, which could attribute to the 
difference. The difference between the two sources was $201,000, or 
7.07%.

***************
New Hampshire
***************

New Hampshire’s State Public Defender contracts out all of its indigent 
defense services. Census Bureau data were found in one expenditure line 
item. No benefits were included, as they were considered to be contracted 
services (i.e., no state employees receive pension benefits). The 
external source was the Governor’s Operating Budget, which provided 
actual expenditure amounts for prior years. The amounts of the two 
sources were equal for each fiscal year from 2009 through 2012.

Due to a lack of detail in Census Bureau data, State Public Defender data 
for fiscal year 2008 were unavailable. Given that other fiscal years were 
exact matches to each other, the data in the final table for fiscal year 
2008 came from the amounts shown in the Operating Budget.

***************
New Jersey
***************

Indigent defense is state run and funded, and it is administered through 
an office within the Treasury Department. Census Bureau data provided 
expenditures for the office, but excluded retirement expenditures, as 
this was done through a centralized agency for the state. The external 
source was the State Budget, which provided actual amounts for prior 
fiscal years.

The difference between the two sources was $3.7 million, or 3.10%, and 
could be due to missing pension contributions and rounding issues, as 
over 100 lines of expenditures for the state are included.

***************
New Mexico
***************

The State Public Defender is a centralized and state funded agency that 
administers indigent defense. Census Bureau data provided the agency’s 
expenditures, including pension contributions. The external source was 
the Public Defender Department Financial Statement, which provides actual 
expenditure amounts. The difference between the two sources was $578,000, 
or 1.45%.

***************
New York
***************

While indigent defense services in the state are provided by the county, 
the state government provides a large amount of local assistance. Since 
2011, the Office of Indigent Legal Services has been in charge of the 
disbursements from the Indigent Legal Services Fund. Prior to this, 
management of the fund was done by the Office of the Comptroller.

For fiscal year 2011, the expenditures in the Census Bureau data were 
from the Office of Indigent Legal Services. Retirement contributions were 
excluded. However, the majority of spending for the office was related to 
local government assistance. The external source was the enacted budget, 
which provided actual expenditures for each agency.

The difference between the two sources was $25 million, or 27.54%. The 
difference was attributed to the line for “Non-personal service/Indirect 
Costs” in the budget, which was not visible in the database query. The 
amounts for “Local Assistance” and “Personal Services” were equal between 
the two sources. The structure of the state-provided data had many 
centralized agency codes for items, such as unemployment benefits, 
pension benefits, and other agency expenditures. The missing amount could 
be included in one of those centralized agency codes.

For the final data table, the additional amount from the budget actuals 
was included, assuming that “Non-personal service/Indirect Costs” were 
overhead for the agency.

****************
North Carolina
****************

Expenditures for the Office of Indigent Defense Services were available 
in Census Bureau data, including pension contributions. The external 
source was the Report of the Commission on Indigent Defense Services, 
which provided actual expenditure amounts.
The difference between the two sources was $169,000, or 0.12%, which 
could be a result of rounding, as 140 expenditure line items were 
included in the database query.


***************
North Dakota
***************

According to Census Bureau data, three funds within the Commission on 
Legal Counsel for Indigents have expenditures for indigent defense 
services: the Indigent Persons Attorney, Public Defense Services, and 
Indigent Defense Services. The external source was is the state’s 
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, which provided actual expenditures 
for the commission.

The difference between the two sources was $704,000, or 13.74% (Census 
Bureau data were greater). The external source only includes amounts 
within the commission’s expenditures. It excludes money from the Indigent 
Defense Services Fund that is expended within the Office of Management 
and Budget. (Detail in the CAFR does not provide that information.) 

For fiscal year 2011, the amount expended within the Office 
of Management and Budget was $350,000. Additionally, 
289 expenditure line items are included in the database query, which 
could contribute to the difference. The difference between the two 
sources, excluding the expenditures from the Office of Management and 
Budget, was $354,000, or 6.91%.

***************
Ohio
***************

While the county governments have input over how its indigent defense 
systems are run, the counties report to the Ohio Public Defender 
Commission, which provides shared revenue and has some direct 
expenditures. Census Bureau data contained expenditures for the 
commission, including pension contributions. The external source was the 
state’s Executive Budget, which showed actual expenditure amounts for 
each fiscal year. For fiscal year 2011, the difference between the two 
sources was $91,000, or 0.12%.

A larger than normal disparity occurred in the amounts for fiscal year 
2008. After analysis of the data, it was determined that certain items 
should have been be excluded, and the state shared revenue portion of 
local aid was about $7 million greater than what was reported as the 
actual amount in the budget. The total difference for 2008 was $8.9 
million, or 11.5%.

It should be noted that the differences between the external source the 
Census Bureau data were less than $1 million for each of the following 
years. Additionally, fiscal year 2008 was the first year that the state 
began providing administrative records for the finance survey. Since 
then, the state has changed its accounting program (e.g., code structure 
and level of detail).

***************
Oklahoma
***************

Excluding Tulsa and Oklahoma Counties, expenditures for the Oklahoma 
Indigent Defense System are state run and funded, and were included in 
Census Bureau data with their pension contributions. The external amounts 
were actual expenditures from the Budgetary Reporting Section of the 
state’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.

The difference between the two sources was $2.4 million, or 16.6%. 
(Census Bureau data were greater.) After a thorough review, it was 
determined that all of the expenditure lines should be included.

***************
Oregon
***************

Census Bureau data provided all of the data for the Public Defense 
Services Commission, which is state run and funded. The external source 
was the Governor’s Budget, which showed actual amounts at a 2-year 
aggregate.

To make a consistent comparison, a 2-year analysis was done for fiscal 
years 2010 and 2011. The difference between the two sources for the 2-
year total was $3.2 million, or 1.43%. Because over 140 expenditure lines 
were included in 2011, the difference may be a result of rounding.

***************
Pennsylvania
***************

Data were unavailable at the state level because the state provides zero 
assistance to local governments for indigent defense services.

***************
Rhode Island
***************

The Office of the Public Defender provides statewide indigent defense 
services, and conflict cases are run within the Judicial Department of 
the state. Expenditures for both agencies were included with pension 
contributions in the Census Bureau data. The external sources were the 
budgets for the Public Defender and the Judicial Department, which 
provide actual expenditure amounts. The difference between the two 
sources was $5,000, or 0.04%.

***************
South Carolina
***************

Expenditures for the Commission on Indigent Defense were included with 
pension contributions in Census Bureau data. The external source was the 
Governor’s Executive Budget - Detail Base Budget, which provides actual 
appropriations from previous years, not actual expenditures from the 
commission. The difference between the two sources was $5,000, or 0.02%.

***************
South Dakota
***************

Each county in the state organizes and funds its indigent defense 
services, with little funding from the state government. No detail is 
available within Census Bureau data to pull expenditures for the state in 
a query. Data in the final table were from the state treasurer’s Fiscal 
Report, which provides actual expenditure amounts for local assistance.


***************
Tennessee
***************

Indigent defense services in the state are primarily run by the state 
government, except for two counties that run their services 
independently. (Shelby and Davidson Counties receive some local 
assistance from the state.) The expenditures of the Indigent Defendants 
Counsel, District Public Defenders Conference, and the Office of the 
Post-Conviction Defender were provided in Census Bureau data, including 
pension contributions. The external amounts were actual expenditures from 
the state’s budget.

The difference between the two sources was almost 
$2 million, or 2.82%. A majority of the difference came from the 
expenditures for each district. The budget excluded lines for “Conference 
Wide Pool” or “Capital Case Training,” which were included in the Census 
Bureau data amount.

The state of Tennessee was unable to report for fiscal year 2009. As 
such, data for the major component of the state were imputed using 
recently reported historical data from the prior year’s annual survey, 
the trend of historical data, or the current year’s budget information. 
These imputations were done at the item code level. As a result, detailed 
information into the programs and departments were unavailable for that 
year.

***************
Texas
***************

Census Bureau data provided expenditures for the Texas Indigent Defense 
Commission. These data also include retirement contributions. The 
external source was the Texas Indigent Defense Commission’s Annual 
Expenditure Report, which provides actual, detailed expenditure amounts 
for each fiscal year. The difference between the two sources was $79,000, 
or 0.22%. This could be attributed to rounding effects, as over 40 
expenditure lines were included in the database query.

***************
Utah
***************

Indigent defense services in the state are provided by county 
governments. The only money provided by the state is in the Post-
Conviction Indigent Defense Fund. These expenditures were clearly stated 
in the state’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, but the detail was 
unavailable in the Census Bureau’s database query. Data from the external 
source were provided as the state expenditures in the final data table.

***************
Vermont
***************

The Office of the Defender General provides the indigent defense services 
statewide. Census Bureau data were provided, including pension 
contributions. The external source used for comparison was the state’s 
Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. The difference between the two 
sources was $55,000, or 0.47%.


***************
Virginia
***************

The Virginia Indigent Defense Commission provides services throughout the 
state. Census Bureau data contained all of the expenditures for the 
commission, including pension contributions. The external source was the 
state’s Executive Budget, which provided appropriated amounts for each 
year.

The difference between the two sources was $1.8 million, or 2.78%. The 
difference could be attributed to comparing an actual amount to an 
appropriated amount and rounding from the raw data file. Over 90 
expenditure lines were included for the Commission.

***************
Washington
***************

While mainly county funded, the state government runs an Office of Public 
Defense. Expenditure amounts for the office with pension contributions 
were included in Census Bureau data. The external amounts were from the 
Judicial Section of the state’s budget. Although Washington creates a 
biennial budget, appropriated amounts for each specific fiscal year are 
located within the source. 

The difference between the two sources was $1.7 million, or 6.98%. This 
may be a result of comparing with appropriated amounts and rounding 
effects, though only 32 lines were included in the database query.


***************
West Virginia
***************

County run but state funded, expenditure amounts for indigent defense 
services in the state were available in Census Bureau data, including 
pension contributions. Census Bureau data included expenditures from the 
general fund and the Public Defender Lottery Fund. The external source 
was the Department Annual Report that provides actual expenditure 
amounts.

The difference between the two sources was $7.3 million, or 18.91%. The 
Annual Report excludes expenditures from the Public Defender Lottery 
Fund, which was the majority of the difference between the two sources.

***************
Wisconsin
***************

Two agencies in the state government provide indigent defense services: 
the Office of the State Public Defender and Indigent Defense Legal 
Services. Census Bureau data provided expenditure amounts for the two 
agencies, including benefit contributions. The external source, the state 
budget, is issued through an omnibus spending act (for fiscal year 2011, 
it was 2009 Act 28). The external source only shows appropriated amounts 
for each agency.

For the Office of the State Public Defender, the difference between the 
two sources was $395,000, or 0.5%, and could be attributed to rounding, 
as 202 expenditure line items were included in Census Bureau data. For 
the Indigent Defense Legal Services, the two amounts were equal.

***************
Wyoming
***************

All of the expenditures for the Office of the State Public Defender were 
included in Census Bureau data, including pension contributions. The 
external source was the state’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report 
(CAFR), which provided one total line for the agency’s actual 
expenditures.

The difference between the two sources was $83,000, or 0.8%. After review 
of the raw data file, the difference could not be contributed to a 
rounding issue. However, without knowing what is included in the CAFR’s 
expenditure line (e.g., this line may include items such as depreciation, 
which were excluded in Census Bureau data), the difference may be due to 
expenditure inclusion.

A legislatively defined 85%/15% split exists between the state and 
counties to fund the state’s agency, although it is administered by the 
state. Given this, 85% of the expenditures reported in Census Bureau data 
were assigned to the state in the data table, and the remaining 15% were 
be assigned to the county aggregate.
