At yearend 2010, state and federal prisons
held a reported 20,093 inmates who had
HIV or AIDS, down from 20,880 at yearend
2009. As a result of this decline, the estimated rate
of HIV/AIDS among prisoners in custody dropped
from 151 HIV/AIDS cases per 10,000 inmates in
2009 to 146 per 10,000 in 2010. The number of state
and federal inmates who died from AIDS-related
causes also declined between 2009 and 2010, from
94 to 72 deaths. During the same period, the rate of
AIDS-related deaths among inmates with HIV/AIDS
declined from 47 deaths per 10,000 inmates to 38 per
10,000.

The 1-year declines between 2009 and 2010 were
consistent with trends over the past decade. Between
2001 and 2010, the estimated rate of HIV/AIDS
among state and federal prison inmates declined an
average of 3% each year (figure 1). During the same
period, the AIDS-related death rate declined an
average of 13% per year among inmates with HIV/
AIDS and 16% among all prison inmates.

Highlights
*****************
* The rate of HIV/AIDS among state and federal prison 
inmates declined from 194 cases per 10,000 inmates in 2001 
to 146 per 10,000 at yearend 2010.
 
* AIDS-related deaths among all state and federal prison 
inmates declined an average 16% per year between 2001 and 
2010, from 24 deaths per 100,000 inmates in 2001 to 5 per 
100,000 in 2010.

* Among state and federal inmates with HIV/AIDS, the rate 
of AIDS-related deaths dropped significantly, from 134 
deaths per 10,000 inmates with HIV/AIDS in 2001 to 38 per 
10,000 in 2010.

* When grouped by 2010 yearend custody populations, the 
declining rate of HIV/AIDS in small, medium, and large 
state prisons had the same 3% average annual decline in the 
national rate between 2001 and 2010. 

* Between 2001 and 2010, the average annual decline of 16% 
in the national AIDS mortality rate mirrored the decline in 
small (down 12%), medium (down 17%), and large (down 19%) 
state prison populations. 

* Rate of HIV/AIDS cases and AIDS-related deaths declined 
across all sizes of prison populations.

* In 2009, the AIDS mortality rate among state prison 
inmates (6 per 100,000) fell below the rate for the U.S. 
general population (7 per 100,000).

* AIDS-related deaths declined from 89 in 2009 to 69 in 
2010 among males, from 70 to 43 among all black non-
Hispanics, and from 87 to 60 among all inmates age 35 or 
older.
****************************************************
Findings in this report are based on data collected from 50 
states and Federal Bureau of Prisons through the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National Prisoner Statistics 
(NPS-1) (which annually collects data on prisoner counts, 
characteristics, admissions, and releases) and Deaths in 
Custody Reporting Program (DCRP) (which collects incident-
level data on cause of inmate death and characteristics of 
those who died).

This bulletin provides data on national trends in the 
estimated rates of HIV/AIDS cases and AIDS-related deaths 
among state and federal prison inmates for 2001 through 
2010. It includes age-specific comparisons between state 
prison inmates and the U.S. general population from 2001 
through 2009. It also provides jurisdiction-level data for 
2009 and 2010 on the number of state and federal inmates 
who were infected with HIV/AIDS, 
HIV/AIDS cases by sex, confirmed AIDS cases, and AIDS-
related deaths that occurred in state prison by 
demographics of inmates who died. 

**********************************************
Rates of HIV/AIDS and AIDS-related deaths 
in prisons have declined steadily since 2001
**********************************************

Between 2001 to 2010, the estimated number of inmates with 
HIV/AIDS declined by 16%, and the number of AIDS-related 
deaths in prison declined by 77% (not shown in table) 
resulting in declines in the rates of HIV/AIDS and AIDS-
related deaths among inmates with HIV/AIDS. At yearend 
2001, the estimated rate of HIV/AIDS among state and 
federal prison inmates was 194 HIV/AIDS cases per 10,000 
inmates. By yearend 2010, the estimated rate was 146 cases 
per 10,000. Among the total inmate population, the rate of 
AIDS-related deaths declined from 24 per 100,000 inmates in 
2001 to 5 per 100,000 in 2010. Among the inmate population 
with HIV/AIDS, the rate declined from 134 AIDS-related 
deaths per 10,000 inmates in 2001 to 38 per 10,000 in 2010. 
(See Methodology for discussion of calculation of rates.)

************************************************
Rates of HIV/AIDS cases and AIDS-related deaths 
declined across all sizes of prison populations
************************************************

Regardless of the size of the state prison population, as 
measured by the number of inmates in custody at yearend 
2010, trends in the rates of HIV/AIDS cases and AIDS-
related deaths in state prisons followed the overall 
decline of the national rate. States were grouped into 
three categories based on the size of their 2010 yearend 
custody populations. The smallest group included states 
with 24,999 or fewer inmates, the medium group included 
states with 25,000 to 49,999 inmates, and the largest group 
included states with 50,000 or more inmates. (See 
Methodology for a list of states included in each group.) 
From 2001 to 2010, the rate of HIV/AIDS declined from 275 
to 211 HIV/AIDS cases per 10,000 inmates in the largest 
group, from 144 to 110 cases per 10,000 inmates in the 
medium group, and from 174 to 130 cases per 10,000 inmates 
in the smallest group (figure 2). Over the 9-year period, 
all groups, regardless of population size, saw an average 
annual decline of about 3% in the rate of HIV/AIDS cases.

Between 2001 to 2010, the rate of AIDS-related deaths 
declined from 28 to 4 per 100,000 inmates in the large 
group of states, from 24 to 4 per 100,000 inmates in the 
medium group, and from 22 to 8 per 100,000 inmates in the 
small group. The smallest average annual decline in the 
rate of AIDS-related deaths was observed in small states 
(down 12%), followed by medium (down 17%) and large states 
(down 19%) (figure 3).

**********************************
The rate of AIDS-related deaths for state prison inmates 
dropped below the rate for the U.S. general population
**********************************

To make AIDS-related death rate comparisons to the general 
population, individual-level data from DCRP were used to 
calculate age-specific rates of AIDS-related deaths among 
those in state prison and AIDS-related deaths as a 
percentage of all deaths in state prison. (See Methodology 
for calculation of age-specific death rates and for sources 
of national mortality data.) The rate of AIDS-related 
deaths in state prisons among inmates ages 15 to 54 
declined sharply between 2001 and 2009, compared to the 
more modest decline observed among the same age group in 
the U.S. general population. As a result, the AIDS-related 
death rate in state prisons fell below the rate in the U.S. 
general population in 2009. Between 2001 and 2009, the 
AIDS-related death rate among state prisoners ages 15 to 54 
declined from 22 deaths per 100,000 inmates to 6 per 
100,000, while the rate  among that age group in the 
general population declined from 9 per 100,000 to 7 per 
100,000 (figure 4).

As a percentage of all inmate deaths, AIDS-related deaths 
among state prisoners ages 15 to 54 declined from 13.4% to 
3.6% between 2001 and 2009. The AIDS death rate, as a 
percentage of all deaths among the general population ages 
15 to 54, remained relatively stable at about 4% (figure 
5).

*******************************
Selected findings from 2009 and 2010 data
*******************************

* A reported 20,093 inmates with HIV/AIDS were in custody 
in state or federal prison at yearend 2010, down from 
20,880 at yearend 2009 (table 1). 

* The reported number of state inmates with HIV/AIDS 
decreased from 19,290 in 2009 to 18,515 in 2010. The number 
of federal inmates with HIV/AIDS also declined, from 1,590 
in 2009 to 1,578 in 2010. 

* California, Florida, New York, and Texas each reported 
holding more than 1,000 inmates with HIV/AIDS at yearend 
2010. These states held 51% (9,492) of all state prisoners 
with HIV/AIDS. 

* Among state and federal inmates with HIV/AIDS at yearend 
2010, 18,337 were male and 1,756 were female, compared to 
19,027 male and 1,853 female inmates at yearend 2009 (table 
2).

* Among jurisdictions reporting the number of inmates with 
confirmed AIDS in both 2009 and 2010 (37 states and the 
Bureau of Federal Prisons), 4,344 inmates had confirmed 
AIDS in 2009 and 3,913 in 2010—a decrease of 431 cases 
(table 3).***Footnote * BJS no longer estimates for 
jurisdictions not reporting confirmed AIDS due to 
insufficient data in recent years. See previous HIV reports 
for estimated confirmed AIDS cases and methodologies.***

* After an increase of five AIDS-related deaths in state 
prisons between 2008 and 2009 (89 to 94), the number fell 
to 72 deaths in 2010. Seven federal inmates died from AIDS-
related causes, which was unchanged from 2009 (table 4). 

* AIDS-related deaths declined from 89 in 2009 to 69 in 
2010 among males, from 70 to 43 among black non-Hispanics, 
and from 87 to 60 among inmates ages 35 or older (table 5).

****************************
National Prisoner Statistics 
*****************************

The federal government began collecting National Prisoner 
Statistics (NPS-1), which primarily measures prison 
population movement, in 1926. The series comprises reports 
from the Departments of Corrections in the 50 states and 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons. NPS-1 includes yearend 
counts of prisoners by jurisdiction, sex, race, 
Hispanic/Latino origin, and admissions and releases during 
the year. In 1991, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) 
began using the NPS-1 to collect data on HIV and confirmed 
AIDS cases in prisons. BJS respondents indicated the 
circumstances under which inmates were tested for HIV and 
reported the number of inmates with HIV/AIDS in their 
custody. Until 2007, the respondents provided the number of 
deaths occurring among inmates under their jurisdiction, 
including those from AIDS-related causes. In this report, 
yearend and midyear custody counts as well as midyear 
jurisdiction counts were used when calculating the rates of 
HIV/AIDS cases and AIDS related death in prison. 
Jurisdiction refers to the legal authority of state or 
federal correctional officials over a prisoner regardless 
of where the prisoner is held. Jurisdiction counts include 
inmates in private facilities. To have custody of a 
prisoner, a state or federal prison system must hold that 
inmate in one of its facilities. Custody counts do not 
include inmates held in private facilities.

***************************
Measuring deaths in prison
***************************

From 1991 to 2006, BJS used NPS-1 to collect data on the 
number of deaths among inmates under the jurisdiction of 
each prison system by cause, including AIDS-related deaths. 
In 2001, BJS implemented the Deaths in Custody Reporting 
Program (DCRP), which collects information describing 
events and characteristics of each death excluding 
executions, occurring among inmates in custody of state 
prisons. Deaths reported through DCRP include those that 
occurred in private facilities. Prior to 2001, BJS relied 
solely on data in the NPS-1 to report on AIDS-related 
deaths. From 2001 to 2006, BJS estimated the number of 
AIDS-related deaths using both data sources. The greater of 
the two numbers of deaths reported was used to calculate 
the totals for those years. After 2006, BJS stopped 
collecting detailed data on deaths in NPS-1 and relied 
solely on the DCRP data. Whether using reported or 
estimated data from multiple data sources, a downward trend 
in the number of AIDS-related deaths has been observed 
(figure 6).

***************************************************
Rate of HIV/AIDS and AIDS-related deaths in prison
***************************************************

To calculate the estimated rate of HIV/AIDS among inmates 
in custody of state and federal prison, the estimated 
yearend count of HIV/AIDS cases was divided by the yearend 
custody population for each year. 

To calculate the rate of AIDS-related deaths in prison per 
inmate population for 2001 to 2006, the number of AIDS-
related deaths estimated in each year from the NPS-1 and 
DCRP were divided by the midyear jurisdiction population 
for 2001 to 2006. The midyear jurisdiction population was 
the denominator because deaths in the NPS-1 were reported 
among those inmates under the jurisdiction of each prison 
system. For 2007 to 2010, the number of AIDS-related deaths 
reported in DCRP was divided by the midyear custody count 
(including inmates held in private facilities) in state 
prisons plus the midyear jurisdiction count in federal 
prisons. The midyear state custody population was the 
denominator because deaths reported in DCRP were among 
those inmates in custody of state prisons. The denominator 
included the midyear federal jurisdiction population 
because deaths reported in the federal prisons were among 
those under federal jurisdiction. 

To calculate the rate of AIDS-related deaths among those at 
risk for dying from HIV/AIDS (those estimated to have 
HIV/AIDS), the number of AIDS-related deaths reported in 
each year was divided by an estimate of the average daily 
population of inmates in prison with HIV/AIDS.  The average 
daily population of those with HIV/AIDS for a given year 
was the average of the most recent year’s estimated yearend 
count of those with HIV/AIDS and the estimated yearend 
count from the previous year. 
 
For comparisons to the general population ages 15 to 54, 
data on deaths reported in the DCRP between 2001 and 2010 
were used solely for the calculations of AIDS-related death 
rates among those 54 or younger in the state prison 
population. 

*************************************
Grouping of states by yearend custody
*************************************

To assess the trends in the rates of HIV/AIDS and AIDS-
related deaths among inmates, state prison populations were 
grouped into categories of small, medium, and large. Groups 
were based on the size of the 2010 yearend custody 
populations. Included in the small group were states with 
fewer than 25,000 inmates, specifically North Dakota, 
Vermont, Montana, Wyoming, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode 
Island, Hawaii, South Dakota, New Mexico, Alaska, Nebraska, 
Idaho, West Virginia, Utah, Delaware, Kansas, Minnesota, 
Iowa, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Kentucky, Nevada, Oregon, 
Arkansas, Tennessee, Washington, Connecticut, Oklahoma, 
Colorado, Louisiana, New Jersey, Wisconsin, Maryland, South 
Carolina, and Indiana. Included in the medium group were 
states with 25,000 to 49,999 inmates, specifically Alabama, 
Virginia, Missouri, Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan, 
Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, and Georgia. Included in the 
large group were states with 50,000 or more inmates, 
specifically New York, Florida, Texas, and California.

********************************
AIDS-related deaths in the U.S. 
general population
********************************

The number of AIDS-related deaths for persons ages 15 to 54 
was based on the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC), 
HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, yearend editions (Vols. 17-
22). Deaths in the U.S. population for persons ages 15 to 
54 were taken from the CDC, National Center for Health 
Statistics’ (NCHS) Monthly Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 
45, No. 11(S). Also, deaths were taken from the NCHS’s 
National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 52, No. 3; Vol. 53, 
No. 5; Vol. 53, No.15;  Vol. 54, No. 19; Vol. 57, No. 14; 
Vol. 58, No.19; Vol. 59, No.10; and Vol. 60, No.4. 

For 2005, U.S. general population deaths can be found in 
the NCHS’s Deaths: Preliminary Data for 2005. For 2001 to 
2009, AIDS-related deaths were calculated as a percentage 
of all deaths among persons ages 15 to 54 in the U.S. 
general population. The  national estimate of AIDS-related 
deaths of persons ages 15 to 54 minus AIDS-related deaths 
of persons ages 15 to 54 in state prisons was divided by 
the national mortality estimates of persons ages 15 to 54 
minus total deaths of persons ages 15 to 54 in state 
prisons. 

For 2001 to 2009, the rates of AIDS-related deaths in the 
U.S. general population were calculated by taking the 
difference of the national estimate of AIDS-related deaths 
for persons ages 15 to 54 and the number of AIDS-related 
deaths for state inmates ages 15 to 54, and dividing it by 
the U.S. general population estimate of those 15 to 54 
minus the state prison population ages 15 to 54. 

********************************
Estimating for missing data 
on HIV/AIDS cases
********************************

The NPS-1 database for 2001 to 2010 was missing data on the 
number of inmates with HIV/AIDS in state and federal prison 
in six states that did not report the number of cases for 1 
or more years. The missing data ranged from a state missing 
1 year of data to another state where data for all 10 years 
(2001 through 2010) were not reported. Estimates do not 
include counts from the state missing data in all years and 
rates were calculated using a denominator that excluded 
this state prison population thereby assuming that the rate 
in this state was equal to the national rate. The remaining 
four states included two missing data for 2 years and two 
missing data for 5 years.

The five states that reported missing data (excluding the 
one state that did not report data in any year) reported 
HIV/AIDS cases in 2001 and, in that year, comprised 3.4% of 
the total number of reported HIV/AIDS cases in state 
correctional facilities (759 out of 22,553 total cases). In 
2008, the five states comprised a similar share of the 
total number of reported HIV/AIDS cases in state 
correctional facilities (3.3% or 665 out of 20,073).

STATA, a statistical software package, was used to linearly 
interpolate the number of HIV/AIDS cases that were not 
reported. This method estimates the missing value by using 
observed data values that are closest in time to the 
missing data value. The missing value is assumed to fall on 
a straight line plotted between two known data points. The 
ipolate function in STATA interpolates the missing value in 
instances where observed values appear before and after the 
missing value to be estimated. The epolate function 
extrapolates the missing value where observed values appear 
only before or after the missing value that is to be 
estimated. 

For example, the interpolated value of HIV/AIDS cases (y) 
in a given state (x) is computed by using the closest known 
values for reported HIV/AIDS cases. If in 2001 (x1) there 
were 15 (y1) cases and in 2003 (x2) there were 10 (y2) 
known cases, the interpolated value for 2002 is computed 
using the following formula:  y=y1+(x-x1)(y2-y1)/(x2-x1). 
In this example, the interpolated number of HIV/AIDS cases 
for that state in 2002 would be an estimated 12.5. In some 
cases, data were missing for multiple consecutive years. 
Data were interpolated using a multi-stage process. For 
example, in a state missing 2006 and 2007 data, the 
interpolated value for 2006 was derived by using observed 
values from 2005 and 2008. The interpolated value for 2007, 
in turn, was derived by using the interpolated value from 
2006 and the observed value from 2008. 

In one state it was necessary to extrapolate the missing 
value as it occurred in the last year of the series (2010). 
This was computed by using a linear equation to predict 
values beyond the observed values using the epolate 
function in STATA 10. A linear equation is derived from the 
observed values for 2008 and 2009 (y=15x-2) and then used 
to predict the value for 2010 where x=3 to determine the 
third year value (2010) in the linear trend from 2008. The 
growth rate from 2009 to 2010 is assumed to be the same as 
from 2008 to 2009 (x=15) and the formula is solved as 
43=(45)-2. The extrapolated value for 2010 is 43 HIV/AIDS 
cases.

State-specific imputed values are not included in the 
report tables, but were used to calculate national rates of 
HIV/AIDS cases in prison and rates by size of state prison 
custody population. For each state with imputed values, 
both upper and lower estimates were produced around the 
imputed values. These upper and lower limits were 
calculated for each state’s imputed value or values by 
adding the largest 1-year increase in HIV/AIDS cases and 
subtracting the largest 1-year decrease from the imputed 
value or values. New national rates based on upper and 
lower limits did not vary more than plus or minus 1 
HIV/AIDS case per 10,000 inmates for any given year (figure 
7). Year-to-year declines were not affected by variations 
in reporting.
