Indicators of Mental Health Problems Reported by Prisoners 
and Jail Inmates, 2011-12

Jennifer Bronson, Ph.D., BJS Statistician
Marcus Berzofsky, Dr. P.H., RTI International

About 1 in 6 state and federal prisoners (14%) and 1 in 4 jail 
inmates (26%) reported experiences that met the threshold for 
serious psychological distress (SPD) in the 30 days prior to a 
survey that was conducted between February 2011 and May 2012 
(figure 1). Similarly, 37% of prisoners and 44% of jail inmates 
had been told in the past by a mental health professional that 
they had a mental disorder. Half of prisoners (50%) and a third 
of jail inmates (36%) either did not meet the threshold for SPD or 
had not been told they had a mental health disorder.

This report presents two prevalence estimates of mental health 
problems among state and federal prisoners and local jail 
inmates: met the threshold for SPD and told by a mental health 
professional as having a mental disorder. The Kessler 6 (K6) 
nonspecific psychological distress scale was used to assess SPD 
among prisoners and jail inmates in the 30 days prior to the 
survey. The estimates are from self-reported data and should not 
be interpreted as representing a clinical diagnosis of a mental 
disorder. The estimates are from self-reported data and should not 
be interpreted as representing a clinical diagnosis of a mental disorder. 
(See Measurement of mental health indicators text box.) 
In this report, SPD in the past 30 days prior to the interview is 
defined as a current mental health problem. In this report 
having ever been told by a mental health professional as having a 
mental disorder is defined as having a history of a mental health 
problem.

HIGHLIGHTS
***********

* More jail inmates (26%) than prisoners (14%) met the threshold 
for serious psychological distress (SPD) in the past 30 days.

* Among those who had been told they had a mental disorder, the 
largest percentage of prisoners (24%) and jail inmates (31%) 
reported they had a major depressive disorder. 

* More prisoners (14%) and jail inmates (26%) met the threshold 
for SPD in the past 30 days than the standardized general 
population (5%).

* Prescription medication was the most common treatment type for 
prisoners and jail inmates who met the threshold for SPD in the 
past 30 days.

* Fourteen percent of prisoners and 10% of jail inmates who met 
the threshold for SPD in the past 30 days were written up or 
charged with assault. 

* A larger percentage of females in prison (20%) or jail (32%) 
than males in prison (14%) or jail (26%) met the threshold for SPD 
in the past 30 days. 

* More white prisoners and jail inmates met the threshold for SPD 
in the past 30 days than black or Hispanic prisoners and jail 
inmates. 

* Prisoners incarcerated for a violent crime (17%) were as likely 
as those incarcerated for a property crime (16%) to have met the 
threshold for SPD in the past 30 days.
****************************************************************

This report examines the prevalence of the two mental health 
indicators by different time periods, demographics, criminal 
justice history, and current offenses. The percentage of inmates 
who had a mental health indicator and who received mental health 
treatment while incarcerated are also presented. Estimates are 
based on the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) 2011-12 National 
Inmate Survey (NIS-3). NIS-3 data were self-reported, and 
analyses include state and federal prisoners and local jail 
inmates. 

To facilitate comparisons to the general population, data from 
the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) were 
standardized to match the prison population and the jail 
population by age, sex, race, and Hispanic origin (see 
Methodology). In addition, the general population was divided 
into three groups based on self-reported involvement with the 
criminal justice system in the year prior to the interview: no 
involvement, under supervision (probation or parole), or 
arrested.

Measurement of mental health indicators
*******************************************

The 2011-12 National Inmate Survey (NIS-3) assessed the 
prevalence of serious psychological distress (SPD) in the 30 days 
prior to the interview and the percentage who had ever been told 
they had a mental disorder by a mental health professional. These 
two measures are used as indicators that an inmate likely has a 
current mental health problem or a history of a mental health 
problem. The estimates are from self-reported data and should not 
be interpreted as representing a clinical diagnosis of a mental 
disorder. Findings also should not be used to infer causation 
between an indicator of a mental health problem and 
incarceration, because the temporal relationship is unknown.  

SPD – The Kessler 6 (K6) nonspecific psychological distress scale 
was used to assess those who met the threshold for SPD in the 30 
days prior to the interview. The K6 is a six-question tool 
developed to screen for serious mental illness among adults age 
18 or older in the general U.S. population, with a score of 13 or 
higher indicating SPD.***Footnote 1 Kessler, R. C., Barker, P. 
R., Colpe, L. J., Epstein, J. F., Gfroerer, J. C., Hiripi, E., 
Howes, M., Zaslavsky, A. M., et al. (2003). Screening for serious 
mental illness in the general population. Archives of General 
Psychiatry, 60(2), 184–189. Kessler, R. C., Green, J. G., Gruber, 
M. J., Sampson, N. A., Bromet, E., Cuitan, M., Zaslavsky, A. M., 
et al. (2010). Screening for serious mental illness in the 
general population with the K6 screening scale: results from the 
WHO World Mental Health survey initiative. International Journal 
of Methods in Psychiatric Research, 19(Supp. 1), 4-22.*** Inmates 
were asked how often during the 30 days prior to the interview 
they felt--

* nervous

* hopeless

* restless or fidgety 

* so depressed that nothing could cheer them up 

* everything was an effort 

* worthless.

The response options were (1) all of the time, (2) most of the 
time, (3) some of the time, (4) a little of the time, and (5) 
none of the time. The responses were recoded from 4 to 0, with 4 
assigned to “all of the time” and 0 assigned to “none of the 
time.” A summary scale with a range of 0 to 24 was then produced 
by combining the responses from all six items. Inmates with a 
score of 13 or higher were considered to have SPD, inmates with a 
score of 8 to 12 were considered to have an anxiety disorder (not 
reported), and inmates with a score of 7 or fewer were considered 
to not have an indicator of a current mental health problem (see 
Methodology).

History of a mental health problem – This measure is based on the 
question, “Have you ever been told by a mental health 
professional, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, that you 
had (1) manic depression, bipolar disorder, or mania; (2) a 
depressive disorder; (3) schizophrenia or another psychotic 
disorder; (4) post-traumatic stress disorder; (5) another anxiety 
disorder, such as panic disorder or obsessive compulsive 
disorder; (6) a personality disorder, such as antisocial or 
borderline personality; or (7) a mental or emotional condition 
other than those listed above?” Inmates who answered positively 
to this question were considered to have a history of a mental 
health problem.

The time period in which an inmate was told they had a mental 
disorder is unknown (e.g., told last week or last year). This 
measure is also affected by a person’s access to professional 
mental health care. These two indicators are not mutually 
exclusive. An inmate could have met the threshold for SPD and a 
history of a mental health disorder. Relatedly, an inmate may 
have met the threshold for SPD, but not have ever been told by a 
mental health professional that they had a mental disorder. Or, 
they could have been told they had a mental disorder but did not 
meet the threshold for SPD. 

Trends are not presented because prior inmate surveys did not 
include the K6 scale. In addition, prior BJS inmate surveys were 
collected with different modes (e.g., audio computer assisted 
self-interview versus computer-assisted personal interviewing). 
This could introduce bias when comparing prevalence estimates of 
mental health indicators across survey years.
****************************************************************

************************************************
Prisoners and jail inmates were more likely to 
have ever been told they had a major depressive 
disorder than other mental disorders 
************************************************

Prisoners and jail inmates who had been told in the past by a 
mental health professional that they had a mental disorder were 
asked to specify the disorder. Nearly a quarter (24%) of the 
prisoners who had ever been told they had a mental disorder said 
they were told they had major depressive disorder, a larger 
percentage than any other mental disorder (table 1). The second 
most common disorder reported by prisoners was bipolar disorder 
(18%). An estimated 13% of prisoners reported they were told they 
had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or a personality 
disorder, such as antisocial or borderline personality disorder. 
Less than 1 in 10 (9%) prisoners said they were told they had 
schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. 

Of those jail inmates with a history of a mental health problem, 
31% had been told they had major depressive disorder, compared to 
being told they had bipolar disorder (25%), an anxiety disorder 
(18%), or PTSD (16%). With the exception of personality disorder, 
jail inmates were more likely than prisoners to have been told 
they had each type of mental disorder.

************************************************
Prisoners and jail inmates were three to five 
times as likely to have met the threshold for 
SPD as adults in the general U.S. population 
************************************************

The percentage of prisoners who met the threshold for SPD (14%) 
was more than three times that of adults in the standardized 
total U.S. general population (5%) or those in the standardized 
general U.S. population with no criminal involvement in the past 
year (4%) (figure 2). However, the percentage of prisoners who 
met the threshold for SPD was almost the same as those in the 
standardized general population who had been arrested (13%) in 
the year prior to the interview.

The percentage of jail inmates who met the threshold for SPD (26%) 
was five times higher than the percentage of adults who met the 
threshold for SPD in the total standardized general U.S. 
population (5%) or those in the standardized general population 
with no criminal involvement in the past year (4%) (figure 3). 
The percentage of jail inmates who met the threshold for SPD was 
almost double the percentage of adults in the standardized 
general population who had SPD who were on probation or parole 
(11%) or who had been arrested in the past year (14%).

***************************************************
Female prisoners and jail inmates were more likely 
to have met the threshold for SPD than males 
***************************************************

A larger percentage of female prisoners than male prisoners met 
the threshold for SPD or had been told by a mental health 
professional that they had a mental health disorder (table 2). 
Among prisoners, 20% of females and 14% of males met the threshold 
for SPD. More females (66%) than males (35%) in prison also had 
a history of a mental health problem. Like prisoners, a larger 
percentage of female jail inmates (32%) met the threshold for 
SPD than male jail inmates (26%). Females in jail (68%) were 
also more likely to have been told they had a 
mental disorder than males in jail (41%).

Seventeen percent of white prisoners met the threshold for SPD, 
which was larger than the percentage of black (12%) and Hispanic 
(12%) prisoners with SPD. Inmates of other races (20%) were more 
likely than white prisoners to have met the threshold for SPD. 
White prisoners (50%) were also more likely than black prisoners 
(30%) to have ever been told they had a mental disorder. An 
estimated 48% of prisoners of other races had ever been told they 
had a mental disorder, which did not statistically differ from 
their white counterparts. 

The pattern of SPD among jail inmates by race and Hispanic origin 
was also similar to that of prisoners. An estimated 31% of white 
jail inmates met the threshold for SPD, which was larger than the 
22% of black jail inmates and 23% of Hispanic jail inmates. White 
(57%) jail inmates were also more likely than black (36%) or 
Hispanic (31%) jail inmates to have ever been told they had a 
mental disorder.

**************************************************
Prisoners age 65 or older were less likely to have 
a mental health indicator, compared to other age 
groups
**************************************************

There was little variation in the prevalence estimates of mental 
health indicators among prisoners by age group. One in six (15%) 
prisoners ages 18 to 64 reported experiences that met the 
threshold for SPD (not shown). Prisoners age 65 or older (10%) 
were less likely than prisoners ages 18 to 24 (15%) to have met 
the threshold for SPD. Similarly, the percentage of prisoners who 
had ever been told they had a mental disorder also varied little 
across age groups. An estimated 37% of prisoners in each age 
category, from ages 18 to 64, reported ever being told they had 
a mental disorder. A smaller percentage of prisoners age 65 or 
older (31%) than prisoners ages 18 to 24 (36%) had ever been told 
they had a mental disorder. 

Prevalence estimates of SPD among jail inmates varied somewhat by 
age. An estimated 26% of jail inmates ages 18 to 44 and ages 55 
to 64 reported experiences that met the threshold for SPD. Jail 
inmates ages 45 to 54 (29%) were more likely to have met the 
threshold for SPD than those ages 18 to 24 (26%). Approximately 
42% of jail inmates ages 18 to 24 met the threshold for SPD, 
compared to those ages 35 to 44 (44%), ages 45 to 54 (48%), and 
ages 55 to 64 (50%).

**************************************************
Prisoners who were married were less likely to 
have met the threshold for SPD than prisoners 
with other marital statuses
**************************************************

Married prisoners (12%) were less likely to have met the threshold 
for SPD than prisoners who were widowed (18%), divorced (15%), 
separated (16%), or never married (15%) (table 3). Married 
prisoners (31%) were also less likely to have ever been told they 
had a mental disorder than prisoners with other marital statuses. 
An estimated 28% of married jail inmates met the threshold for 
SPD, which was similar to the percentage of widowed (31%), 
divorced (28%), or separated (29%) jail inmates who met the 
threshold for SPD. However, the percentage of never married jail 
inmates who met the threshold for SPD (25%) was less than the 
percentage of married jail inmates who had SPD (28%).

Married jail inmates were the least likely to have ever been told 
they had a mental disorder (40%) when compared to inmates with 
other marital statuses. Approximately 58% of jail inmates who 
were widowed, 51% who were divorced, 50% who were separated, and 
43% who were never married had ever been told they had a mental 
disorder. 

**************************************************
Prisoners and jail inmates with a college degree 
were more likely than high school graduates to 
have a history of a mental health problem 
**************************************************

An estimated 16% of prisoners with less than a high school 
education met the threshold for SPD. This was larger than the 
percentage who met the threshold for SPD and who were high school 
graduates (12%) or who had a college degree or more (13%). An 
estimated 38% of prisoners with less than a high school degree 
had ever been told they had a mental disorder, compared to 32% of 
those with a high school degree. However, prisoners with at least 
a college degree (41%) were more likely than those without a high 
school degree or equivalent (38%) to have been told they had a 
mental disorder.

Among jail inmates, 27% of those with less than a high school 
education met the threshold for SPD. This did not statistically 
differ from the percentage of jail inmates with some college 
education (26%). An estimated 45% of jail inmates with less than 
a high school degree had ever been told they had a mental 
disorder, compared to 39% with a high school degree or 
equivalent, 47% with some college, and 50% of those with a 
college degree or more.

**************************************************
The percentage of prisoners incarcerated for a 
violent offense who met the threshold for SPD was 
similar to those incarcerated for a property 
offense who met the threshold for SPD
**************************************************

Prisoners incarcerated for a violent offense (17%) or a property 
crime (16%) were equally likely to have met the threshold for SPD 
(table 4). Likewise, the percentage of prisoners incarcerated for 
a violent offense who had a history of a mental health disorder 
(42%) was similiar to the percentage of prisoners incarcerated 
for a property offense (41%) who had a mental health disorder. 
Prisoners incarcerated for a violent crime were more likely to 
have met the threshold for SPD than those incarcerated for a drug 
crime (10%), DWI/DUI (14%), or other public order offense (13%). 
Among prisoners with a history of a mental health problem, those 
incarcerated for a drug offense (27%), a DWI/DUI (32%), or other 
public order offense (36%) were less likely to have ever been 
told they had a mental disorder than prisoners incarcerated for 
a violent offense (42%).

An estimated 29% of jail inmates incarcerated for a violent 
offense met the threshold for SPD. This was larger than the 
percentage of jail inmates incarcerated for a property offense 
(27%), a drug offense (25%), a DWI/DUI (24%), or other public 
order offense (26%). The percentage of jail inmates incarcerated 
for a violent crime who had ever been told they had a mental 
disorder (48%) did not statistically differ from the percentage 
of jail inmates incarcerated for a property offense (50%). 
However, this was higher than the percentage incarcerated for 
a drug (40%), DWI/DUI (38%), or other public order (45%) offense. 

**************************************************
The percentage of prisoners who met the threshold 
for SPD did not differ by sentence length
**************************************************

Among sentenced prisoners, those sentenced to 1 to 4 years (13%), 
5 years or more (14%), or a life sentence (17%) were as likely to 
have met the threshold for SPD as prisoners sentenced to less than 
1 year (15%). There was no statistical difference across sentence 
length in the percentage of prisoners who reported they had ever 
been told they had a mental disorder (about 36% across sentence 
length categories).

Unsentenced jail inmates (23%) were less likely than sentenced 
jail inmates (29%) to have met the threshold for SPD. There was no 
statistical difference between the percentage of unsentenced 
(44%) and sentenced (45%) jail inmates who had ever been told 
they had a mental disorder. Compared to jail inmates with a 
sentence of less than 1 year (22%), those with a sentence of 5 
years or more (25%) were more likely to have met the threshold for 
SPD.  

**************************************************
The percentage of inmates who had ever been told 
they had a mental disorder did not differ by time 
served since admission
**************************************************

Among prisoners, 17% who had served less than 1 month since 
admission in the current facility met the threshold for SPD. This 
percentage was not statistically different than the percentage 
who had served 1 to 5 months (15%), 6 to 11 months (15%), or 5 
years or more (14%). However, prisoners who had served 1 to 4 
years (14%) were less likely to have met the threshold for SPD, 
compared to those with less than 1 month time served (17%). There 
was no difference by time served and the percentage of prisoners 
who had ever been told they had a mental disorder, averaging 37% 
across time served groups. 

Jail inmates who had served less than 1 month were more likely to 
have met the threshold for SPD (29%) than inmates who had been in 
the current facility for 1 to 5 months (26%), 6 to 11 months 
(23%), or 1 to 4 years (24%) since admission. As was the case 
with prisoners, there was no difference by time served and the 
percentage of jail inmates who reported that they had been told 
they had a mental disorder (about 43%).

**************************************************
A larger percentage of prisoners and jail inmates 
with more than one arrest than those with one 
arrest had been told they had a mental disorder
**************************************************

Prisoners with more than one arrest were more likely to have a 
mental health indicator than prisoners with one arrest (table 5). 
Twelve percent of prisoners with one arrest met the threshold for 
SPD, compared to 14% of those with 2 to 3 arrests, 15% with 4 to 
10 arrests, and 18% with 11 or more arrests. Prisoners with one 
arrest (27%) were less likely to have ever been told they had a 
mental disorder than all other prisoners. For example, among 
prisoners who reported 11 or more arrests in their lifetime, 49% 
had been told at some point that they had a mental disorder. 

Unlike prisoners, the percentage of jail inmates who met the 
threshold for SPD did not increase with number of arrests. About 
24% of jail inmates in each arrest category met the threshold for 
SPD. Like prisoners, jail inmates with multiple arrests were more 
likely to have been told they had a mental disorder. More than 
half (56%) of jail inmates who had been arrested 11 times or more 
had been told they had a mental disorder, compared to a third 
(31%) of jail inmates with one arrest. 

**************************************************
Prisoners who spent 5 years or more previously 
incarcerated were more likely to have met the 
threshold for SPD than those with no prior time 
served
**************************************************

Total time incarcerated in a correctional facility includes the 
time spent as an adult or juvenile in a prison, jail, or other 
correctional facility prior to admission to the current facility. 
Among prisoners who met the threshold for SPD, there was no 
statistical difference between those with no prior incarceration 
time (13%) and those who spent up to 5 years incarcerated (an 
average of 14%). However, prisoners who spent 5 years or more 
total time in a prior correctional facility (17%) were more 
likely than those with no prior incarceration time (13%) to have 
met the threshold for SPD. Prisoners with no prior incarceration 
time were the least likely to have been told they had a mental 
disorder (29%). An estimated 37% of prisoners who were previously 
incarcerated for 6 to 11 months, 38% of those incarcerated for 1 
to 4 years, and 43% of those incarcerated for 5 years or more had 
been told they had a mental disorder.

Twenty-five percent of jail inmates with no prior incarceration 
time met the threshold for SPD, which was more than the 22% of 
jail inmates incarcerated for 1 to 4 years. Jail inmates with no 
prior incarceration (35%) were less likely than inmates with any 
prior incarceration (41% to 54%) to have been told they had a 
mental disorder. More than half (54%) of jail inmates 
incarcerated for 5 years or more had been told they had a mental 
disorder.

**************************************************
Almost three-quarters of inmates who met the 
threshold for SPD had received mental health 
treatment in their lifetime 
**************************************************

Approximately 3 in 4 prisoners (74%) and jail inmates (73%) who 
met the threshold for SPD said they had received mental health 
treatment in their lifetime (table 6). About 42% of prisoners and 
43% of jail inmates who met the threshold for SPD said they had 
stayed overnight in a hospital, and about 62% said they had taken 
prescription medication during their lifetime for a mental health 
problem.

Of prisoners who had been told they had a mental disorder, 88% 
said they had received mental health treatment in their lifetime, 
including 45% had stayed overnight in a hospital, 76% had 
received prescription medicine, and 75% had received counseling 
or therapy. Among jail inmates, 90% of those who had ever been 
told they had a mental disorder received mental health treatment 
in their lifetimes, including 80% who had received prescription 
medication.

**************************************************
Prisoners who had a mental health indicator were 
more likely than similar jail inmates to have 
received treatment since admission to their 
current facility
**************************************************

More than half (54%) of prisoners who met the threshold for SPD 
had received mental health treatment since admission to the 
current facility, compared to a third (35%) of jail inmates. An 
estimated 46% of prisoners who met the threshold for SPD had 
received prescription medication, 42% had received counseling or 
therapy, and 34% had received prescription medication and 
counseling or therapy. Among jail inmates who met the threshold 
for SPD, 30% had received prescription medication, 18% had 
received counseling or therapy, and 13% had received prescription 
medication and counseling or therapy since admission.

Prisoners who had ever been told they had a mental disorder (63%) 
were more likely than jail inmates (44%) to have received 
treatment since admission. Among those with a mental health 
problem, a greater percentage of prisoners (49%) than jail 
inmates (24%) had received counseling or therapy. Likewise, a 
greater percentage of prisoners (39%) than jail inmates (18%) 
with a mental health problem had received a combination of 
counseling or therapy and prescription medication.

**************************************************
About a third of inmates with a mental health 
indicator were currently receiving treatment
**************************************************

Inmates who had a mental health indicator were also asked if they 
were currently receiving treatment for a mental health problem. 
An estimated 36% of prisoners and 30% jail inmates who met the 
threshold for SPD said they were receiving treatment for a mental 
health problem as of the time of the interview. There was no 
statistical difference between the percentage of prisoners and 
jail inmates who met the threshold for SPD and said they were 
currently receiving prescription medication (29% of prisoners and 
26% of jail inmates). Jail inmates who met the threshold for SPD 
were half as likely to report receiving counseling or therapy 
(13%) as prisoners who met the threshold for SPD (26%).

Among inmates who had ever been told they had a mental disorder, 
37% of prisoners and 38% of jail inmates said they were currently 
receiving treatment for a mental health problem. An estimated 30% 
of each group said they were currently taking prescription 
medication.

**************************************************
Prisoners and jail inmates who met the threshold 
for SPD were more likely than those without SPD 
to be written up or charged with an assault while 
incarcerated
**************************************************

Prisoners and jail inmates were asked if they had been written up 
or charged with assaulting an inmate, physically assaulting a 
correctional officer or staff, or verbally assaulting a 
correctional office or staff since admission to the current 
facility.***Footnote 2 Estimates derived from the 90% sample 
only. See Methodology.*** Compared to prisoners without an 
indicator of a mental health problem (4%), prisoners who met the 
threshold for SPD (14%), or who had ever been told they had a 
mental disorder (12%) were more likely to be written up or 
charged with a verbal or physical assault against a correctional 
officer, staff, or assault of another inmate (table 7). Three 
percent of prisoners with no indicator of a mental health problem 
were written up or charged with assaulting another inmate, 
compared to 9% of prisoners who met the threshold for SPD and 7% 
of those who had been told they had a mental disorder. 

Among jail inmates with no indicator of a mental health problem, 
4% were written up or charged with assault. This group was less 
likely to be written up or charged with assault than jail inmates 
who met the threshold for SPD (10%) or who had been told they had 
a mental disorder (10%).

Methodology
*************

The 2011-12 National Inmate Survey
************************************

The 2011-12 National Inmate Survey (NIS-3) was conducted in 233 
state and federal prisons, 358 jails, and 15 special facilities 
(military, Indian country, and Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) facilities) between February 2011 and May 2012. 
The data were collected by RTI International under a cooperative 
agreement with the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).

The NIS-3 administered two questionnaires to inmates: a survey 
about sexual victimization and an alternative survey about mental 
and physical health, past drug and alcohol use, and treatment for 
substance abuse. Inmates were randomly assigned to receive one of 
the two questionnaires so that, at the time of the interview, the 
content of the survey remained unknown to facility staff and the 
interviewers.

A total of 106,532 inmates participated in NIS-3, receiving 
either the sexual victimization survey or the randomly assigned 
alternative survey. Combined, the surveys were administered to 
inmates in state and federal prisons (43,721), jails (61,351), 
military facilities (605), Indian country jails (192), and ICE 
facilities (663).

The interviews, which averaged 35 minutes in length, used 
computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and audio 
computer-assisted self-interviewing (ACASI) data collection 
methods. For approximately the first 2 minutes, interviewers 
conducted a personal interview using CAPI to obtain background 
information and the date of admission to the facility. For the 
remainder of the interview, inmates interacted with a computer-
administered questionnaire using a touchscreen and synchronized 
audio instructions delivered via headphones. Respondents 
completed the ACASI portion of the interview in private, with the 
interviewer either leaving the room or moving away from the 
computer. The entire ACASI questionnaire (listed as the National 
Inmate Survey-3) is available on the BJS website.

A shorter paper questionnaire (PAPI) was made available for 
inmates who were unable to come to the private interviewing room 
or interact with the computer. The paper form was completed by 
751 prisoners (1.9% of all prisoner interviews) and 264 jail 
inmates (0.5% of all jail inmate interviews). Those who completed 
the PAPI were not asked about their physical health, mental 
health, past drug and alcohol use, or treatment for substance 
abuse.

Additional information on the methodology for sample selection of 
facilities and inmates can be found in Sexual Victimization in 
Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 2011–12 (NCJ 241399, BJS 
web, May 2013). 

Mental health module
**********************

The analysis of the mental health module was restricted to adult 
prisoners or jail inmates. Juvenile inmates who were 16 or 17 
years of age and inmates in military, Indian country, or ICE 
facilities were excluded from this report.

To determine whether inmates had an indicator of a current mental 
health problem, the NIS-3 included the Kessler 6 scale for 
nonspecific psychological distress (see Measurement of mental 
health indicators text box). The NIS-3 also included questions to 
assess whether or not an inmate had a history of a mental health 
problem, defined as having ever been told by a mental health 
professional that they had a mental disorder. The mental health 
indicator questions were contained in a mental health screener 
that was part of a mental health module. 

Among inmates who received the sexual victimization survey (90% 
of inmates surveyed), all inmates received the mental health 
screener component. Respondents who completed the core sexual 
victimization survey in less than 35 minutes were eligible to 
receive the follow-up mental health component. Respondents who 
did not indicate a mental health problem legitimately skipped the 
items in the detailed follow up. Based on these thresholds, within 
prisons 37,359 inmates received the mental health screener 
questions. Among those respondents, 84% (31,508 prisoners) were 
eligible to receive the detailed mental health follow-up items. 
Among jail respondents, 52,384 inmates received the mental health 
screener items. Among those, 92% (48,338 jail inmates) were 
eligible to receive the detailed mental health follow-up items.
  
Among inmates who received the alternative survey on mental and 
physical health, past drug and alcohol use, and treatment for 
substance abuse (10% of inmates surveyed), both mental health 
components were administered to prisoners and jail inmates. All 
4,304 prisoners and 6,704 jail inmates who were randomized to the 
alternative survey received the full mental health module.  

Nonresponse bias analysis
***************************

Bias occurs when the estimated prevalence of an outcome is 
different from the actual prevalence of the outcome for a given 
facility. One potential source of bias is nonresponse. For each 
survey in the NIS-3, a nonresponse bias analysis was conducted to 
determine whether inmates did not receive the mental health 
module due to it only being administered in ACASI. The PAPI 
respondents were found to have a higher prevalence of sexual 
victimization and more likely to reside in administrative 
segregation. These two conditions may be correlated to an 
inmate’s mental health status. Given that the PAPI respondents 
made up 1.9% of prisoners and 0.5% of jail inmates, it was 
determined that a weight adjustment could reduce the potential 
bias due to PAPI respondents not receiving the mental health 
screener items. 

Weighting and nonresponse adjustments
**************************************

Responses from interviewed inmates were weighted to produce 
national-level estimates. Each interviewed inmate was assigned an 
initial weight corresponding to the inverse of the probability of 
selection within each sampled facility. A series of adjustment 
factors was applied to the initial weight to minimize potential 
bias due to nonresponse and to provide national estimates. For 
the analysis of the mental health module, these adjustments were 
one of two types:

1. adjustments to account for survey nonresponse

2. adjustments to account for survey mode nonresponse.

Methods to adjust for survey nonresponse are described in detail 
in Sexual Victimization in Prisons and Jails Reported by Inmates, 
2011-12 (NCJ 241399, BJS web, December 2014). Bias could result 
if the PAPI respondents were different from the ACASI 
respondents. The adjustment for mode nonresponse included a 
calibration of the weights so that the weight from a PAPI 
respondent was assigned to an ACASI respondent with similar 
characteristics. Because both ACASI and PAPI respondents provided 
demographic and criminal history information, these data were 
used in weight adjustment. For each inmate, these adjustments 
were based on a generalized exponential model, developed by 
Folsom and Singh (2002), and applied to the sexual victimization 
survey respondents. ***Footnote 3 Folsom, Jr., R. E., & Singh, A. 
C. (2002). The generalized exponential model for sampling weight 
calibration for extreme values, nonresponse, and 
poststratification. Proceedings of the American Statistical 
Association, Survey Research Methods Section, 598-603.***

The mode nonresponse adjustment maintained the bench marked 
totals designed to make national-level estimates for the total 
number of inmates age 18 or older who were held in jails at 
midyear 2011 or in prison at yearend 2011. These benchmark totals 
represented the estimated number of inmates by sex, from BJS’s 
2011 Annual Survey of Jails and 2011 National Prisoner 
Statistics. The national estimates for state prisons were 
1,154,600 adult males and 83,400 adult females; for federal 
prisons, 190,600 adult males and 13,200 adult females; and for 
jails (with an average daily population of six or more inmates), 
628,620 adult males, and 91,551 adult females.

After the adjustment for potential nonresponse bias, a final 
adjustment was conducted to combine the data from the sexual 
victimization survey and the alternative survey. For this 
adjustment, the weight for each responding inmate was multiplied 
by the probability of receiving the survey type received. In 
other words, the survey nonresponse and mode nonresponse adjusted 
weight for the ACASI respondents were multiplied by 0.90 and for 
respondents to the sexual victimization survey and alternative 
survey.

Comparison of estimates by NIS-3 survey type
*********************************************

Prior to producing estimates from the combined set of sexual 
victimization and alternative survey respondents, a comparison of 
key estimates was conducted. This was done to ensure that 
questions on sexual victimization did not alter how inmates 
responded to the mental health screener items, compared to 
inmates that were not asked about their sexual victimization 
status. 

Using the analysis weights created for each survey, estimates 
were produced and tested to determine if they were significantly 
different. For all key estimates, the sexual victimization and 
alternative survey respondents had statistically similar 
estimates. Therefore, it was determined that the combined data 
could be used for all analyses.
 
Standard errors and tests of significance
*******************************************

As with any survey, the NIS-3 estimates are subject to error 
arising from their basis on a sample rather than a complete 
enumeration of the population of adult inmates in prisons and 
jails. For each mental health indicator, the estimated sampling 
error varies by the size of the estimate, number of completed 
interviews, and intra-cluster correlation of the outcome within 
facilities. 

A common way to express this sampling variability is to construct 
a 95% confidence interval around each survey estimate. Typically, 
multiplying the standard error by 1.96 and then adding or 
subtracting the result from the estimate produces the confidence 
interval. This interval expresses the range of values that could 
result among 95% of the different samples that could be drawn.

To facilitate the analysis, rather than provide the detailed 
estimates for every standard error, differences in the estimates 
of sexual victimization for subgroups in this report have been 
tested and notated for significance at the 95% confidence level. 
For example, the difference in the percentage of female jail 
inmates who met the threshold for serious psychological distress 
(SPD) (32.3%) compared to male jail inmates (26.0%) is 
statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (table 2). 
In all tables providing detailed comparisons, statistically 
significant differences at the 95% confidence level or greater 
have been designated with two asterisks (**). 

General population estimates 
******************************

In the general population, prevalence rates of SPD in the past 30 
days come from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health 
(NSDUH). The NSDUH is an annual nationwide survey that provides 
national and state-wide estimates on the use of tobacco products, 
alcohol, illicit drugs, and the prevalence of mental health 
problems among the general U.S. population. Respondents are 
randomly selected at the household level.***Footnote 4 SAMHSA. 
NSDUH - About the Survey. Retrieved on March 30, 2016 from 
https://nsduhweb.rti.org/respweb/project_description.html.*** 
This sampling method is unlikely to capture persons who are 
homeless, in temporary shelters, transient or highly mobile, or 
in hospitals or residential rehabilitation or treatment centers--
all populations who may have a higher risk for mental disorders, 
substance use disorders, or both. 

To be most comparable to the inmate population included in the 
NIS-3, the survey years 2009 through 2012 of NSDUH were used in 
this analysis. While the NIS-3 reference period does not include 
2009 or 2010, these years were included to increase the precision 
in the general population estimates. An analysis of the estimates 
of general population across the 4 years found that the mental 
health estimates did not change appreciably during this period. 
Therefore, including additional years of data to increase 
precision would not shift the study period estimates enough to 
alter any comparisons to the 2011-12 inmate population. 

The NSDUH includes indicators that measure a person’s self-
reported past year criminal justice involvement. With this 
information, the total general population was split into three 
groups: 

* persons not involved in the criminal justice system during the 
past 12 months

* those on probation or parole during the past 12 months

* those arrested in the past 12 months. 

These groups are not mutually exclusive in that a person can be 
both on probation or parole and have been arrested in the past 12 
months. It is assumed that persons in the general population on 
probation and parole or those arrested in the past 12 months are 
more similar to the inmate populations than those not involved 
with the criminal justice system during the past 12 months. 

Standardization of general 
population estimates
************************************

When comparing two populations, differences found for some 
characteristics or conditions may be statistically different as a 
result of a true difference in the populations or due to basic 
demographics differences that are associated with the outcome of 
interest. Standardizing the estimates is one method to determine 
if these demographic differences are the sole cause for 
differences found in other characteristics or conditions. 

Standardization of survey estimates consists of calibrating the 
survey weights for one population such that, for key demographic 
characteristics that are known for each population, the 
distributions are identical. This process was done using SUDAAN’s 
PROC DESCRIPT procedure. The resulting estimates are not a 
representation of the standardized population by themselves 
(i.e., generalizations about the population cannot be made from 
standardized estimates), but are appropriate estimates for 
comparison with other populations of interest. 

In this report, estimates were standardized for each of the four 
general population types (e.g., the total general population and 
three criminal justice involvement subgroups). For each general 
population type, estimates were standardized to the inmate 
populations’ distribution by sex, race, Hispanic origin, and age. 
Because the inmate populations for prisoners and jail inmates 
differed, the general population was standardized separately to 
each inmate population (see appendix tables 1 and 2). Figure 2 
includes standardized estimates to the prison population. Figure 
3 includes standardized estimates to the jail population.
