***********************************************     
From June 2010 to June 2011, the total number of persons
confined in county and city jails (735,601) declined by 1.8%
(or 13,127 inmates) (figure 1, table 1). This was the third
consecutive year of declining inmate populations. The number
confined in local jails peaked in June of 2008 at 785,533
inmates. Since then, the number has declined by about 50,000
persons (or 6.4%). The average daily count of persons in
jails also declined by about 50,000 inmates during this same
3-year period.

The jail incarceration rate--the confined population per
100,000 U.S. residents--dropped to 236 in 2011,down from 259
in 2007. The 2011 incarceration rate was the lowest jail
incarceration rate since 2002.

Males accounted for 87% of the jail population on June 30,
2011 (tables 6 and 7). Whites accounted for 45% of the total,
blacks represented 38%, and Hispanics represented 15% of
inmates. Fewer than 6,000 juveniles were held in local jails
(or less than 1% of the confined population).

At midyear 2011, about 6 in 10 inmates were not convicted,
but were in jail awaiting court action on a current charge--a
rate unchanged since 2005. About 4 in 10 inmates were
sentenced offenders or convicted offenders awaiting
sentencing.

More than half of the decline in the jail inmate population
occurred in large jails 

The decline in confined population in the largest jails--
those with an average daily population of more than 1,000
inmates--accounted for more than half (53%) of the total
decline of 13,127 inmates that occurred during 2011
(table 3). The largest jails held a disproportionately large
number of inmates, accounting for 48% of the jail population
at midyear 2011. The share of inmates in each jail size
category did not change significantly between 2010 and 2011,
indicating that all size categories of jails had somewhat
similar rates of decline in population. Across jail size
categories, the decline in confined population ranged from
about 0.8% to 2.6%.

Percentage of capacity occupied continued to decline 

The estimated rated capacity for all jail jurisdictions at
midyear 2011 reached 877,302 beds, an increase of 1.2%
(10,520 beds) from midyear 2010 (figure 2, table 2). The
increase in 2011 was less than the average annual increase
each year since 2000 (2.5% or 21,742 beds). Rated capacity is
the maximum number of beds or inmates allocated to each
jail facility by a state or local rating official. The
percentage of rated capacity occupied at midyear 2011 (84%)
was the lowest since 1984 (86%). Jail jurisdictions holding
1,000 or more inmates reported the highest percentage of
occupied bed space at midyear 2010 (91%) and 2011 (88%),
compared to jails holding fewer than 50 inmates at midyear
2010 (69%) and 2011 (66%) (table 5).

In addition to measuring the rated capacity occupied based
on the inmate count at midyear, the measurement can be
based on an average daily population in jail jurisdictions
(726,657) in the 12 months ending June 30, 2011, and by the
number of inmates on the most crowded day in jails during
June 2011. Using these two measures, the nation's jails
operated at about 83% of rated capacity on an average day
and about 88% of rated capacity on their most crowded day
in June 2011.

While the confined population and rated jail capacity both
increased at roughly comparable rates from 2000 through
2008, since that year their growth rates have diverged. The
confined population declined by about 2% per year while
rated capacity increased by about 2% per year. The increase
in capacity and decrease in confined population almost
equally contributed to the decline in the percentage of
capacity occupied from 95% in 2008 to 84% in 2011.

Jail jurisdictions holding between 100 and 249 inmates
experienced the largest difference in change rates between
rated capacity and the jail inmate population (figure 3).
Over the 4-year period these jail jurisdictions reported
a 3.8% decline in their inmate custody population and a
19.2% increase in their rated capacity. The smallest jail
jurisdictions, which held fewer than 50 inmates, reported
the smallest difference between change in their inmate
population (down 3.0%) and change in rated capacity (up
4.7%). Jail jurisdictions holding 250 to 999 inmates
reported similar patterns. Since 2008, the largest jail
jurisdictions reported a decline in their inmate population
and in their rated capacity. Jail jurisdictions holding 50 to
99 inmates reported an increase in their inmate population
andin their rated capacity.

Local jails admitted almost 11.8 million persons during
the 12 months ending June 30, 2011

Local jails admitted an estimated 11.8 million persons
during the 12 months ending midyear 2011, down from
12.9 million persons admitted during the same period in
2010 and 13.6 million in 2008. The number of persons
admitted in 2011 was about 16 times the size of the inmate
population (735,601) at midyear 2011. (See Methodology for
methods used to estimate admissions.)

Nearly 4 in 10 (39%) admissions during the last week of June
2011 were to the largest jail jurisdictions (table 4). Jail
jurisdictions holding fewer than 50 inmates accounted for
6.7% of all jail admissions, but the number of inmates
admitted was about 32 times the size of the inmate population
at midyear 2011. These small jails also experienced the
highest turnover rate (132%) compared to large jail
jurisdictions (50%). Higher turnover rates mean larger
numbers of admissions and releases relative to the size of
the average daily population.

Methodology

Annual Survey of Jails

In years between the complete census of local jails, the
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducts the Annual Survey
of Jails (ASJ). ASJ is a sample survey of local jails used to
estimate the number and characteristics of local inmates
nationwide. For the 2011 ASJ, the U.S. Census Bureau, as
the collection agent, drew a sample of 873 jail jurisdictions
represented by 930 jail facilities (also referred to as
reporting units). This sample represents approximately 2,830
jail jurisdictions nationwide. Local jail jurisdictions
include counties (parishes in Louisiana) or municipal
governments that administer one or more local jails.

The 2011 ASJ sample included all jails with certainty (67)
that were operated jointly by two or more jurisdictions
(also referred to as multi-jurisdictional jails). Other jail
jurisdictions included with certainty (268) were those that--

* held juvenile inmates at the time of the 2005 Census of
Jail Inmates and had an average daily population of 500 or
more inmates during the 12 months ending June 30, 2005

* held only adult inmates and had an average daily
population of 750 or more.

The remaining jurisdictions were stratified into two groups:
jurisdictions with jails holding at least one juvenile on
June 30, 2005, and jails holding only adults on that date.
Using stratified random sampling, 538 jurisdictions were
selected from eight strata based on the two conditions
described above, and from four strata based on the average
daily jail inmate population when the latest Census of Jail
Inmates was completed during 2005.

BJS obtained data from sampled jail jurisdictions by mailed
and web-based survey questionnaires. After follow-up phone
calls and facsimiles, the response rate for data reporters
was 100% for critical items, such as the number of inmates
confined, average daily population, and rated capacity. (See
tables 10, 11 and 12 for standard errors associated with
reported estimates from the ASJ 2011.)

Response rate, nonresponse adjustment, and out-of scope
jail facilities

The 2011 ASJ sampling frame comprised 926 reporting
units. Ninety-six percent (or 888) of the 926 individual
reporting units responded to the 2011 data collection, and
38 individual reporting units did not respond to the
survey.***Footnote *The sampling frame initially comprised
930 units. However, four units were out-of-scope for the 2011
data collection because they had closed, either permanently
or temporarily, which resulted in the sampling frame of 926
active respondents***.

BJS implemented nonresponse weight adjustment procedures to
account for missing data from survey nonrespondents, as it
did in 2010. However, prior to implementing the plan, data
were estimated for four nonrespondents. After November 2,
2011, BJS implemented the nonresponse weight adjustment
procedure to account for 34 respondents that did not
participate.

Respondent indicators

The respondent reporting unit indicator JAILRhij is set for
each individual reporting unit j in jurisdiction i in stratum
h on the file, based on the status of the individual
reporting unit.
=
{ 0 if nonrespondent, closed, or out of scope.
{ 1 if respondent or using prior year data JAILRhij

The respondent jurisdiction indicator JURISRhi is set
for each jurisdiction i in stratum h on the file, based on
the value of JAILRhij for the reporting units within the
jurisdiction.

{ 1 if JURISRhi =
{ 0 otherwise.
j=1
ni JAILRhij  1  

Active indicators

The active reporting unit indicator JAILAhij is set for each
individual reporting unit j in jurisdiction i in stratum h on
the file, based on the status of the individual reporting
unit.
=
{ 0 if closed, or out of scope.
{ 1 if respondent, using prior year data, or nonrespondent
JAILAhij

The active jurisdiction indicator JURISAhi is set for each
jurisdiction i in stratum h on the file, based on the value
of JAILAhij for the reporting units within the jurisdiction.

JURISAhi = 
{ 1 if
{ 0 otherwise.
j=1
ni JAILAhij    1

Nonresponse weighting adjustment factor

The nonresponse weighting adjustment factor is calculated
within each stratum. We use the sample weights in the
nonresponse adjustment factor. The nonresponse weighting
adjustment factor F2h is calculated as

F2h =
JURISAhi i=1nh Whi    
JURISRhi i=1
nh Whi    

where
nh = number of jurisdictions in stratum h,
whi = sample weight for jurisdiction i in stratum h.

Final weight

The final weight FWhij for each individual reporting unit on
the 2011 ASJ data file is calculated as
FWhij = F2h Whij JAILRhij    

where

Whij= sample weight for reporting unit j in jurisdiction i in
stratum h. JAILRhij is used to set the final weight to 0 for
units that are closed, out-of-scope, or nonrespondents.

Weekly admission and release estimation procedures

Based on the 2011 ASJ, 855 of the 892 (including estimates
for four nonrespondents) individual reporting units (96%)
provided valid data on weekly admissions or releases. To
calculate an overall weekly estimate, data on offender flows
through local jails were estimated for the 37 reporting units
that did not report specific data on admissions and releases.
Nonresponse weight adjustments account for the 34 survey
nonrespondents.

Estimates were calculated based on the following criteria:

* Data for 8 individual reporting units included admission
and release data based on estimates from the 2009 Annual
Survey of Jails.

* Data for 17 individual reporting units included admission
and release data based on estimates from the 2010 Annual
Survey of Jails.

* Admission and release data for 1 individual reporting unit
were based on admission data reported in 2010. 

* Admission data for 11 individual reporting units were
based on release data reported in 2011.

Calculating annual admissions

The Annual Survey of Jails collects data on weekly
admissions. BJS determined that the June admission data
from the 2004 Survey of Large Jails (SLJ) were a reliable
source to calculate a nationwide annual admission estimate.
Although the number of admissions to jails fluctuated
throughout the year, the SLJ tracked monthly movements from
January 2003 to January 2004 and showed that the June 2003
count (339,500) closely matched the annual average number of
admissions (342,956). The number of annual admissions was
calculated by multiplying the weekly admissions by 365 days
and dividing by 7 days.

Calculating weekly turnover rates

Weekly jail turnover rates were modeled after the Bureau of
Labor Statistics' Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.
Additional information on turnover rates is available at
http://www.bls.gov/jlt/. Jail turnover rates were calculated
by adding admissions and releases, and then dividing by
the average daily population. The turnover rate takes into
account jail admissions and releases and gives an indication
of the fluctuation of the jail population.

Jurisdiction size categories

BJS categorized jurisdiction sizes in tables 3, 4, and 5 and
in figure 3 of this report, based on the average daily jail
population during the 12 months ending midyear 2006 (which
was the first year in the current Annual Survey of Jails
series). For the 2010 report, comparisons of size categories
from midyear 2009 to midyear 2010 were based on the average
daily population during the 12 months ending midyear 2009. In
previous reports (2007 through 2009) the size category
comparisons were based on the 12 months ending midyear of the
specific collection year. As a result, not all data in
previous reports' tables are comparable with data in this
report's tables.

Jail functions

Jails in the ASJ include confinement facilities--usually
administered by a local law enforcement agency--that
are intended for adults but may hold juveniles before or
after adjudication. Facilities include jails and city/county
correctional centers; special jail facilities, such as
medical or treatment release centers, halfway houses, and
work farms; and temporary holding or lockup facilities that
are part of the jail's combined function. Inmates sentenced
to jail facilities usually have a sentence of 1 year or less.
Within the ASJ, jails--

* receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them
awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing

* re-admit probation, parole, and bail bond violators and
absconders 

* temporarily detain juveniles pending transfer to juvenile
authorities

* hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to
appropriate mental health facilities

* hold individuals for the military, for protective custody,
for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses

* release convicted inmates to the community upon completion
of sentence

* transfer inmates to federal, state, or other authorities

* house inmates for federal, state, or other authorities
because of crowding of their facilities

* sometimes operate community-based programs as alternatives
to incarceration

Terms and definitions used in the report

Admissions--Persons are officially booked and housed
in jails by formal legal document and the authority of the
courts or some other official agency. Jail admissions include
persons sentenced to weekend programs and who are booked into
the facility for the first time. Excluded from jail
admissions are inmates re-entering the facility after an
escape, work release, medical appointment or treatment
facility appointment, and bail and court appearances. BJS
collects jail admissions for the last 7 days in June.

Average daily population--The average is derived by the
sum of inmates in jail each day for a year, divided by the
number of days in the year (i.e., between July 1, 2010, and
June 30, 2011).

Average annual change--The mean average change across a
12-month time period.

Calculating annual admissions--BJS collects the number of
jail admissions during the last 7 days in June. Annual jail
admissions are calculated by multiplying weekly admissions
by the sum of 365 days divided by 7 days.

Calculating weekly jail turnover rate--This rate is
calculated by adding admissions and releases and dividing by
the average daily population. See Calculating weekly turnover
rates for additional information.

Inmates confined at midyear--The number of inmates held in
custody on the last weekday in June.

Jail incarceration rate--The number of inmates held in the
custody of local jails, per 100,000 U.S. residents.

Percent of capacity occupied--This percentage is calculated
by taking the number of inmates at midyear, dividing by the
rated capacity, and multiplying by 100.

Rated capacity--The number of beds or inmates assigned by a
rating official to a facility, excluding separate temporary
holding areas.

Releases--Persons released after a period of confinement
(e.g., sentence completion, bail/bond releases, other
pretrial releases, transfers to other jurisdictions, and
deaths). Releases include those persons who have completed
their weekend program and who are leaving the facility for
the last time. Excluded from jail releases are temporary
discharges including work release, medical appointment or
treatment center, court appearance, furlough, day reporting,
and transfers to other facilities within the jail's
jurisdiction.

Under jail supervision but not confined--This classification
includes all persons in community-based programs operated
by a jail facility. Programs include electronic monitoring,
house arrest, community service, day reporting, and work
programs. The classification excludes persons on pretrial
release and who are not in a community-based program run
by the jail, as well as persons under supervision of
probation, parole or other agencies, inmates on weekend
programs, and inmates who participate in work release
programs and return to the jail at night.

Weekend programs--Offenders in these programs are
allowed to serve their sentences of confinement only on
weekends (i.e., Friday-Sunday).
