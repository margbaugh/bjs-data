Highlights
             
Among injured female victims of rape or 
sexual assault, half of those indicating 
that the crime was reported to the police
received medical treatment, compared to a 
fifth of those indicating the crimes were 
unreported

*  All rapes, 39% of attempted rapes, and
17% of sexual assaults against females
resulted in injured victims, 1992-2000.
             
*  Most injured rape, attempted rape, and
sexual assault victims did not receive
treatment for their injuries.
             
*  Most rapes and sexual assaults against
females were not reported to the police. 
Thirty-six percent of rapes, 34% of
attempted rapes, and 26% of sexual assaults 
were reported to police, 1992-2000.  
             
*  When a rape or sexual assault was reported 
to the police, the victim was the most likely 
to report it. 
             
*  59% of the victims of completed rape
whose victimizations were reported to the
police were treated for their injuries,
compared to 17% of rape victims with
unreported victimizations. 
             
*  45% of injured female victims of a
reported attempted rape compared to 22%
of injured victims of an unreported
attempted rape received medical treatment, 
1992-2000.
             
*  Of all injured sexual assault victims,
37% of victims in which the violence was
reported and 18% of victims in which the
violence was unreported received medical
treatment, 1992-2000.
------------------------------------------------
             
Persons age 12 or older experienced an
average annual 140,990 completed rapes,
109,230 attempted rapes, and 152,680
completed and attempted sexual assaults
between 1992 and 2000, according to the
National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS).  Most rapes and sexual assaults
were committed against females:  Female
victims accounted for 94% of all completed
rapes, 91% of all attempted rapes, and
89% of all completed and attempted
sexual assaults, 1992-2000. 
             
Because of the small number of sample cases 
of rape and sexual assault against males, 
analysis in the remainder of this report 
relates to female victims only.  Data are 
aggregated across 9 years to produce
average annual estimates.
             
Injuries 
             
All victims of completed rape are considered 
to have been injured, by NCVS definition.  
Thirty-eight percent of female rape victims 
sustained an injury in addition to the rape. 
Thirty-nine percent of attempted rape victims 
and 17% of sexual assault victims were injured 
during their victimization, 1992-2000.  
Nonfatal injuries from any crime range from 
bruises and chipped teeth (minor) to broken 
bones and gunshot wounds (serious). (See 
Injuries from Violent Crime, 1992-98, 
NCJ 168633.)  
             
Among completed rape victims, 33% had
additional minor injuries, and 5% suffered
additional serious injuries. Two-thirds of
attempted rape victims suffered minor
injuries.  Three percent of injured victims
were seriously injured during an attempted
rape. Fifty-four percent of injured sexual
assault victims reported receiving minor
injuries, and 5% were seriously injured.  
             
Reporting to police
             
Most rapes and sexual assaults were not
reported to the police.  Sixty-three percent
of completed rapes, 65% of attempted
rapes, and 74% of completed and attempted 
sexual assaults against females were not 
reported to the police.  (See box, page 3, 
for the most common reasons for not 
reporting.)  When the police were notified 
about a rape or sexual assault, the victim 
most often made the report.  
             
Treatment of injuries
             
Most injured rape and sexual assault victims 
were not treated for their injuries.
Treatment for injuries range from receiving
care at the scene or in the victim's home to
being admitted to a hospital.  Thirty-two
percent of completed rape victims, 32% of
injured attempted rape victims, and 27% of
injured sexual assault victims were
treated. 

Forty-eight percent of female rape victims
who received treatment for their injuries
were treated at, but not admitted to, a
hospital.  An additional 24% of treated
rape victims were cared for at home or at
the scene, and 20% were treated at a
doctor's office or clinic. 
             
Injured victims of attempted rape were
equally likely to be treated at the scene/
home or at a hospital.  Of injured female
attempted rape victims, 44% were treated,
but not admitted to the hospital, and 39%
were treated at the scene or at home.
             
Injured victims of completed and attempted 
sexual assault received treatment at the 
scene or at home (20%), at a doctor's office 
or clinic (31%), or at the hospital (24%) at 
statistically similar percentages.  
             
Reporting violence to the police and 
treatment of injuries sustained
             
Between 1992 and 2000, an annual average 
of 131,950 completed rapes were
committed against females age 12 or older
in the United States.  By definition all
131,950 victimizations resulted in an
injured victim.  Though all victims were
injured, 36% (or 47,960) of these
victimizations were reported to the 
police. A greater percentage of reported
victimizations, compared to nonreported
victimizations, involved medical treatment
of the victims.  Fifty-nine percent of 
victims of a reported completed rape, 
compared to 17% of victims of an unreported 
completed rape, received medical attention.
             
U.S. females age 12 or older were victims
of an estimated 98,970 attempted rapes,
annually.  Thirty-nine percent of attempted
rape victims were injured. Among injured
victims, 42% stated the violence was
reported to police.  Among injured victims,
a higher percentage of reported attempted
rapes (45%), compared to unreported
attempted rapes (22%), received medical
treatment.

Reasons for not reporting to law
enforcement authorities
             
When victims of rape, attempted rape, and
sexual assault did not report the crime to
the police, the most often cited reason 
was that the victimization was a personal
matter: 
             
Rape:  personal matter, 23.3%; fear of 
reprisal, 16.3%; police biased, 5.8%.
             
Attempted rape: personal matter, 16.8%;
fear of reprisal, 11.3%;  protect offender,
9.9%.
             
Completed and attempted sexual assault: 
personal matter, 25.3%; reported to
different official, 12.4%;  fear of 
reprisal, 11.3%.
             
The victim-offender relationship and
informing the police
             
The closer the relationship between the
female victim and the offender, the greater
the likelihood that the police would not 
be told about the rape or sexual assault.
             
When the offender was a current or former
husband or boyfriend, about three-fourths
of all victimizations were not reported to
police (77% of completed rapes, 77% of
attempted rapes, and 75% of sexual 
assaults not reported).  
             
When the offender was a friend or 
acquaintance, 61% of completed rapes,
71% of attempted rapes, and 82% of
sexual assaults were not reported.
             
When the offender was a stranger, 54% of
completed rapes, 44% of attempted rapes,
and 34% of sexual assaults were not
reported to the police.
-----------------------------------------------
             
Seventeen percent (or 23,020) of the
135,550 completed or attempted sexual
assaults annually against females age 12
or older resulted in an injury.  Most 
sexual assault victims were not injured 
(83%).  Most uninjured sexual assault 
victims stated that the violence went 
unreported to the police (77%).  
             
Of those victims injured during a sexual
assault, 41% of the violence was reported
to police, and 57% went unreported.  Among 
injured sexual assault victims, a higher 
percentage of those whose assault was 
reported (37%), compared to victims of 
unreported crimes (18%), received
treatment.
