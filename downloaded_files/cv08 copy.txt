BJS Statistician

Violent and property crime rates in 2008 were at or near their 
lowest levels in over three decades, according to findings from the 
National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The violent crime 
rate in 2008—19.3 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or 
over—was statistically unchanged from the previous year’s 
estimate of 20.7 per 1,000 persons. The property crime rate of 135 
victimizations per 1,000 households was lower than the rate of 147 
per 1,000 households in 2007. 

There was no statistical difference between the 2007 and 2008 
crime rates for any crime of violence. Overall in 2008, U.S. 
residents experienced 4.9 million violent crimes (rape/sexual 
assault, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault) and 16.3 
million property crimes (household burglary, theft, and motor 
vehicle theft) (table 1). Declines in both motor vehicle theft (-20%) 
and theft (-9%) contributed to the overall decline in the property 
crime rate between 2007 and 2008.    

Violent and property crime rates, including the rate of every type 
of violent and property crime measured by the NCVS, declined 
from 1999 to 2008. The violent crime rate declined by 41% and the 
property crime rate fell by 32% over the 10-year period. Declines 
ranged from 23% for household burglary to 53% for rape or sexual 
assault. 

NCVS year-to-year findings between 2007 and 2008 are consistent 
with the preliminary findings from the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation's (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program. 
NCVS findings show a nominal, but not statistically significant, 
decline in the number of violent crimes and a significant decline in 
the number of property crimes. Findings from the UCR program 
show small declines in the numbers of violent (-2.5%) and property 
(-1.6%) crimes. Because both programs measure an overlapping but 
not an identical set of offenses and use different methodologies, 
exact congruity between NCVS and UCR estimates is not to be 
expected. Throughout the 37-year history of the NCVS, the 
programs have generally demonstrated a similar direction in the rise 
or fall in the year-to-year changes in the levels of violent and 
property crimes. 

A major difference between the programs is that the NCVS obtains 
estimates of both crimes not reported and those reported to the 
police. The UCR collects data on reported crimes. According to the 
NCVS, victims reported 47% of violent crimes and 40% of 
property crimes to the police in 2008.

The NCVS collects information from victims of nonfatal violent 
crimes and property crimes 

The NCVS collects information on nonfatal crimes, reported and not 
reported to the police, against persons age 12 or older from a nationally 
representative sample of U.S. households. It produces national rates 
and levels of personal and property victimization, as well as information 
on the characteristics of crimes and victims and the consequences of 
victimization to victims.  

Violent crimes measured by the NCVS include rape, sexual assault, 
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault. Property crimes 
include household burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft. The survey 
also measures personal theft, including pocket picking and purse 
snatching. 

In 2008, 42,093 households and 77,852 individuals age 12 and older 
were interviewed for the NCVS. Each household was interviewed twice 
during the year. The response rate was 90.4% of households and 86.2% 
of eligible individuals.

Violent and property crime rates remain at historic lows in 2008 

The violent crime rate has experienced a number of distinct trends 
throughout the history of the NCVS. Initially, the rate rose somewhat 
from 1973 to 1981 and declined until 1986. The rate reached a high in 
1994, followed by an extended, sharp decline lasting until 2002. The 
violent crime rate has remained generally stable since 2004.(Footnote 1:  
1Trends in victimization rates exclude NCVS estimates for 2006 because 
of the methodological inconsistencies between the data for 2006 and 
other years. See NCVS Methodological Changes in 2006 on page 2 
(below) and Criminal Victimization, 2006 Technical Notes at 
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cv06tn.pdf>. Trend data for 
violent crime are available at <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/ 
tables/viortrdtab.htm> (last accessed August 17, 2009).) The rate in 
2008 was 41% lower than it was 10 years earlier, and 63% below the
peak of 51.8 violent crimes per 1,000 persons age 12 or older in 1994 
(table 2, figure 1). 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
NCVS Methodological Changes in 2006
A number of methodological changes were implemented in the NCVS in 2006 
that impacted the victimization rate estimates for that year. The changes
and their impact upon the survey’s estimates are described in Criminal 
Victimization 2006 Technical Notes, available online at <http://www.
ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cv06.pdf>. 

Analyses of the 2007 data by BJS and the Census Bureau found that the 
effects were reversed in 2007, suggesting that the 2006 findings 
represented a temporary anomaly in the data. For this reason, 
discussion of trends in this report excludes the estimates for 2006. 
See Criminal Victimization, 2007 at <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/
pub/pdf/cv07.pdf> for a fuller discussion of 2007 estimates. NCVS 
estimates for 2008 are consistent with and comparable to estimates
for 2007, 2005, and previous years.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Trends for individual types of violent crime varied from 1999 to 2008. 
Crime rates for simple assault—the least serious but most prevalent 
violent crime—and robbery declined in the early part of the 10-year 
period and remained generally unchanged in the latter part. Rates of 
aggravated assault declined from 1999 through 2002 and remained 
stable until 2005. Aggravated assault rates for 2007 and 2008 represent 
new lows for this type of crime (table 3). The rate of rape committed in 
the U.S. declined from 1999 to 2000 and has remained stable since 
2000.

Property crime rates, including the rate for each type of property crime 
measured by the NCVS, have fallen throughout most of the survey's 
existence. Overall rates fell from 1999 to 2002 and remained stable until 
2004 before declining in 2005. The property crime rate per 1,000 
households in 2008 was 76% lower than in 1974—the peak year for the 
rate of this crime—and 32% lower than in 1999 (figure 2). 
The rate of burglary declined from 1999 to 2000, remained stable until 
2005, and fell in 2007. The rate was unchanged from 2007 to 2008. 
NCVS findings show that rates of property theft declined in increments 
during the 10-year period. Property theft decreased from 1999 to 2002, 
stabilized until 2004, and decreased from 2004 to 2008. 
Motor vehicle theft remained stable throughout most of the period 
despite some fluctuation after its initial decline from 1999 to 2000. The 
motor vehicle theft rate was at its lowest level in 2008.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Federal Bureau of Investigation, Uniform Crime Reports, 2007-2008
Violent crime as measured by the FBI through the UCR includes murder 
and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated 
assault. Property crimes include burglary, larceny theft, and motor 
vehicle theft. The UCR program measures crimes against both persons 
and businesses reported to the police. For information about the 
differences and similarities of the NCVS and UCR, see The Nation’s Two 
Crime Measures at <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/ntcm.pdf>. 
According to the preliminary UCR results released by the FBI, the 
number of violent crimes reported to law enforcement declined by 2.5% 
between 2007 and 2008. UCR data showed a decline in the number of 
every crime measured with one exception: burglary increased by 1.3% 
(text table 1).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Victims of violent crimes in 2008 were similar to those in previous 
years

Characteristics of victims of violent crimes measured by the NCVS in 
2008 were similar to previous years. Males, blacks, and persons age 24 
or younger experienced violent victimizations at higher or somewhat 
higher rates than females, whites, and persons age 25 or older (table 4).

Gender 

Females were more likely than males to be victims of rape or sexual 
assault. Males experienced higher rates of victimization than females in 
all other violent crimes measured by the NCVS.

Race 

With the exception of simple assault, blacks experienced higher rates 
than whites for every violent crime measured by the NCVS. Blacks also 
had higher rates than persons of other races (American Indian, Alaska 
Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander) of overall 
violence and simple assault, and marginally higher rates of robbery and 
aggravated assault. 

In 2008, 1% of the U.S. population self-identified as being of more than 
one race. Individuals of more than one race experienced violent crime at 
rates 2 to 3 times higher than whites, blacks, or persons of other races. 

Hispanic origin 

Non-Hispanics experienced overall violent crime at a rate somewhat 
higher than Hispanics in 2008. A higher rate of simple assault for non-
Hispanics contributed to this finding. Hispanics were more likely than 
non-Hispanics to be victims of robbery in 2008, a finding consistent with 
previous years.

Age 

Victimization rates in 2008 for violent crime decreased with age. 
Generally, for every crime measured by the NCVS, persons age 12 to 24 
had the highest rates of victimization; persons age 50 or older had the 
lowest rates. Juveniles age 12 to 15 experienced higher rates of simple 
assault than persons age 25 or older, and marginally higher rates than 
persons age 20 to 24. 

Lower income households and larger households experienced higher 
property crime rates  

In general, an inverse relationship between property crime rates and 
annual household incomes exists. Lower income households had higher 
rates of overall property crime, household burglary, and property theft, 
compared to higher income households in 2008 (table 5). 

Differences between the property crime rates for households in the 
lowest and highest income groups were smaller for theft than for 
burglary. Households in the lowest income group—less than $7,500 per 
year—experienced property crime rates that were about 1.5 times higher 
than the rates for households earning $75,000 or more per year; burglary 
rates were more than 3 times higher. There were no differences between 
income groups in the rates of motor vehicle theft.  

In general, property crime rates were directly related to household size in 
2008. With three exceptions, larger households experienced higher rates 
of property crime per 1,000 households than smaller households. 
Apparent differences in the rates of burglary and motor vehicle theft for 
households with four or five persons and for those with six persons or 
more were not statistically significant. In addition, no statistically 
significant differences were found in the rates of motor vehicle theft 
between single person households and those with two or three persons. 
For every type of property crime, households with six persons or more 
experienced higher victimization rates than smaller households.
Victims knew the offenders in about 5 in 10 violent crimes against 
men and 7 in 10 violent crimes against women 

The percentage of violent crime committed against males and females 
by someone they knew (i.e., nonstranger) is driven by assault (table 6). 
Male victims knew the offenders in half of all aggravated and simple 
assaults against them. Female victims knew the offenders in 
approximately 70% of assaults against them. Offenders known to the 
victims were most often identified as friends or acquaintances, 
accounting for a similar percentage of violence against male (42%) and 
female (38%) victims. 

Strangers were responsible for about a third (36%) of all violent crimes 
measured by the NCVS in 2008 (not shown in table). The percentages of 
overall violence, robbery, and aggravated and simple assault committed 
by strangers were higher for males than for females. Robbery was the 
crime most likely to be committed by a stranger. Strangers committed 
61% of robberies against men and 45% of robberies against women. 

The greatest disparity between violent crimes committed against males 
and females in 2008 was in the percentage committed by intimate 
partners. The NCVS defines intimate partners as current or former 
spouses, boyfriends, or girlfriends. Intimate partners were responsible 
for 3% of all violence against males and 23% of all violence against 
females in 2008. From 2007 to 2008, there was no significant difference 
in the numbers and rates of intimate partner victimizations for males and 
females (text table 2). 

Text table 2. Number and rate of intimate partner 
violence,  by victims' gender, 2007 and 2008


			2007				2008
		Number		Rate		Number 		Rate
Male		69,100		0.6		88,120		0.7
Female		554,260		4.3		504,980		3.9


Firearms were used in 7% of all violent crimes in 2007 and 2008
An offender was armed with a gun, knife, or other object used as a 
weapon in an estimated 20% of all incidents of violent crime in 2008 
(table 7). By specific weapon type, offenders used about equal 
percentages of firearms, knives, and other weapons to commit violent 
crimes overall. Robberies (40%) were the most likely crime to involve an 
armed offender. Firearms (24%) were the most common weapon used in 
robberies. 

Offenders used firearms to commit 7% of all violent crimes in both 1999 
and 2008 (text table 3). The rate of firearm violence declined from 2.5 
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older in 1999 to 1.4 per 1,000 
persons age 12 or older in 2008. The percentage of all incidents of 
violent crime committed with firearms fluctuated between 6% and 9% 
during the 10-year period. (See <http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/glance/
firearmnonfatalno.htm>. Last accessed August 17, 2009).).

Nearly half of all violent crimes and 40% of all property crimes were 
reported to police in 2008

Of the violent offenses measured by the NCVS, robbery (61%) and 
aggravated assault (62%) were more likely than rape/sexual assault and 
simple assault (each 41%) to be reported to the police (text table 4). Of 
the property crimes measured, motor vehicle theft (80%) was the crime 
most frequently reported to the police in 2008.

  Rape/sexual assault					41.4
  Robbery						60.5
  Aggravated assault					62.0
  Simple assault					41.3

Property crime						40.3%
  Burglary						56.2
  Motor vehicle theft					79.6
  Theft							33.6

The percentage of violent crime reported to the police fluctuated during 
the 10-year period from 1999 to 2008 (figure 3). The percentage of 
violent crime reported in 2008 (47%) was not significantly different from 
the percentage reported in 1999 (44%). The percentage of property 
crimes reported to police in 2008 was higher than from 1999 to 2001, 
and not significantly different from the percentages reported from 2002 
to 2005. Percentages reported for 2008 were also higher than those 
reported in 2007. 

Violent crimes against females were somewhat more likely to be 
reported to the police in 2008 than violent crimes against males (table 8). 
Violent crimes against black females were reported to a greater extent 
than those against white females or against males of any race, and to a 
slightly greater extent than those against females of other races. There 
were no differences in the likelihood of violent crimes against male and 
female Hispanics or non-Hispanics being reported to the police. 

Property crimes against households were equally likely to be reported to 
the police whether the head of household was male or female. For 
households with a black female head of household, property crimes 
were more likely or somewhat more likely to be reported than property 
crimes against all other households. For households with a male head of 
household, property offenses against non-Hispanics were reported at a 
somewhat higher rate than those against Hispanics. No differences 
emerged in the likelihood of property crime being reported between 
female Hispanic and non-Hispanic heads of households.

Methodology

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an annual data 
collection conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of 
Justice Statistics (BJS). The NCVS collects information on nonfatal 
crimes, reported and not reported to the police, against persons age 12 
or older from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households.| 

Violent crimes measured by the NCVS include rape or sexual assault, 
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault. Property crimes 
include household burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft. 

Survey results are based on the data gathered from residents living 
throughout the United States, including persons living in group quarters, 
such as dormitories, rooming houses, and religious group dwellings. The 
scope of the survey excluded Armed Forces personnel living in military 
barracks and persons living in an institutional setting, such as a 
correctional facility. 

Each housing unit selected for the National Crime Victimization Survey 
(NCVS) remains in the sample for 3 years, with each of seven interviews 
taking place at 6-month intervals. An NCVS field representative’s first 
contact with a household selected for the survey is in person. The field 
representative may conduct subsequent interviews by telephone. To 
elicit more accurate reporting of incidents, the NCVS uses a self-
respondent method that requires a direct interview with each person 12 
years or older in the household. 

Annual collection year estimates of the levels and rates of victimization 
are derived by accumulating estimates quarterly. The weights of all 
crimes reported during the interviews in that year are summed, 
regardless of when the crime occurred. The base for the collection year 
rate for personal crimes is the sum of all person weights. The base for 
the property crime rates is the sum of all household weights. For more 
detail, see the Methodology for Criminal  
Victimization in the United States, Statistical Tables, at 
<http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cvusst.htm>. 

As discussed in Criminal Victimization, 2006 and Criminal Victimization, 
2007, methodological changes implemented in 2006 impacted the 
estimates for that year to an extent that the estimates were not 
comparable to those of previous years. An evaluation of 2007 and 2008 
data from the NCVS conducted by BJS and the Census Bureau found a 
high degree of confidence that estimates for 2007 and 2008 are 
consistent with and comparable to those for 2005 and previous years. 
For this reason, discussion of trends in the rates of crime excludes the 
2006 data.  

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data from 2006 are included in the discussion of trends in firearms and police 
reporting because the effects on the 2006 estimates were on the levels 
and rates of crime and did not impact the distributions across the 
variables describing the characteristics and consequences of crime. BJS 
and the Census Bureau continue to examine the impact of the 
methodological changes on the survey estimates. The reports, Criminal 
Victimization, 2006 and Criminal Victimization, 2007, are available at 
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cv06.pdf> and <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/pub/pdf/cv07.pdf>.
BJS tested the comparisons between the percentages and rates for 
Criminal Victimization, 2008, to determine the statistical significance of 
observed differences. Differences described as higher, lower, or 
different passed a test at the 0.05 level of statistical significance (95%-
confidence level). Differences described as somewhat, slightly, 
marginally, or some indication passed a test at the 0.10 level of 
statistical significance (90%-confidence level). Caution is required when 
comparing estimates not explicitly discussed in this bulletin.
