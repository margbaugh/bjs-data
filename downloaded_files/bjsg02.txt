About the Bureau of Justice
Statistics

The Bureau of Justice Statistics collects,
analyzes, publishes, and disseminates
information on crime, criminal offenders,
victims of crime, and the operation of 
justice systems at all levels of government. 
These data are critical to Federal, State, 
and local policymakers in combating crime 
and ensuring that administration of justice 
is both efficient and evenhanded. 

This year BJS will  --

*  Conduct interviews among a nationally
representative sample of 45,000 households
comprising nearly 80,000 U.S. residents
about any experiences they may have had
as crime victims during the year.

*  Describe the characteristics and
consequences of nearly 26 million criminal
victimizations. 

*  Analyze the operations of the 50,000
agencies, offices, courts, and institutions
that comprise the justice system.

*  Count populations and conduct sample
surveys among the more than 6.5 million
adults who during an average day are
subject to the care, custody, or control 
of Federal, State, and local criminal 
justice authorities. 

*  Maintain more than two dozen major
data collection series from which it
publishes and distributes reports
nationwide. 

*  Undertake special data collections and
analyses to respond to programmatic,
policy, and legislative needs of the
Department, the Administration, Congress,
and the criminal justice community.

*  Maintain a website and data archive that
has up to 12,000 visitors a day, including
scholars, students, policymakers, the
media, and others around the world.

*  Provide assistance to users in identifying
sources of BJS information, interpreting
statistical data from BJS series and data
collections, and understanding the
methodologies of BJS surveys.

BJS annually publishes data on --

*  Criminal victimization 
*  Populations under correctional
supervision 
*  Federal criminal offenders and case
processing. 

BJS' periodic data series gather 
information on --

*  Administration of law enforcement
agencies and correctional facilities 
*  Prosecutorial practices and policies 
*  State court case processing 
*  Felony convictions

A description of the various BJS data series
can be found under the topical sections of
this report. 

The U.S. Census Bureau carries out many
of BJS' data collection activities.  BJS 
staff also coordinate with other Department 
of Justice statistical programs, such as the
FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program and
National Incident-Based Reporting System. 
The BJS Federal Justice Statistics Program
collects data from other Federal agencies,
including the Executive Office for U.S.
Attorneys, the Administrative Office of the
U.S. Courts, the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 
and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. 

BJS provides financial and technical 
support to State and local governments 
in -- 

*  developing capabilities in criminal
justice statistics
*  implementing the National Incident-
Based Reporting System
*  improving the accuracy, utility, and
interstate accessibility of criminal history
records
*  enhancing records of protective orders
involving domestic violence and stalking,
sex offender records, automated
identification systems, and other State
systems supporting national records
systems and their use for background
checks.  

BJS also supports surveys, conferences,
and technical assistance on issues that
relate to criminal records policy, covering
topics such as State criminal history record
procedures and systems, privacy and security 
standards, and interstate exchange of 
criminal history records for noncriminal
justice purposes.
 
Crimes and victims

Victimization surveys

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) 
is the Nation's primary source of information 
on criminal victimization.  The NCVS provides 
data on the number of rapes, sexual assaults, 
robberies, assaults, thefts, household  
burglaries, and motor vehicle thefts 
experienced by U.S. residents age 12 or older 
and their households each year.  

*  In 2000 U.S. residents age 12 or older
experienced approximately 25.9 million
crimes. Just over 19 million (75%) were
property crimes, 6.3 million (24%) were
crimes of violence, and 1% were personal
thefts. 

*  Murders, as measured by law enforcement 
data provided to the FBI's Uniform Crime 
Reports, were the least frequent violent 
victimization.  There were about 6 murder 
victims per 100,000 persons in 1999.
 
*  In 2000 for every 1,000 persons age 12 or
older, there occurred --
--1 rape or sexual assault        
--2 assaults with injury 
--3 robberies.

Initiated in 1972 and redesigned in 1992,
the NCVS is the only national crime
measure that includes both those crimes
that people experience but do not report to
law enforcement authorities and those that
they do report.  During a collection year,
data are obtained at 6-month intervals from
a nationally representative sample of
roughly 45,000 households, comprising
nearly 80,000 persons, on the impact,
frequency, and consequences of criminal
victimization in the United States.  

The survey enables BJS to estimate
victimization of specific segments of the
population such as the elderly or city
dwellers.  The NCVS is the only national
forum for victims to describe the
consequences of crime and the
characteristics of violent offenders.

Crime Victimization Survey software is
available to help communities conduct 
local crime and attitudinal surveys.  
The Crime Victimization Survey (CVS) 
software package, designed by BJS and the 
Office of Community Oriented Policing 
Services (COPS), allows communities to 
conduct their own telephone surveys of 
residents to collect data on crime 
victimization, attitudes toward policing, 
and other community issues.  

Using the established methods and questions 
of the National Crime Victimization Survey, 
this software allows communities to generate
crime and victimization estimates that
facilitate comparisons among similar
jurisdictions. The software is available free 
of charge from the BJS website at <www.ojp.
usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cvs.htm> or from NCJRS 
for a small shipping and handling fee by 
calling 1-800-851-3420.  

In addition to the software, both the online
file and the CD-ROM include the CVS Software 
User's Manual (NCJ 176361) and Conducting 
Community Surveys: A Practical Guide for Law 
Enforcement Agencies (NCJ 178246), which is a 
brief overview of the issues related to 
conducting local surveys.  The CD-ROM version 
comes with printed copies of both documents.  
Agencies or communities that are interested in
conducting local victimization surveys are
encouraged to contact local universities or
research organizations.  BJS will also assist
researchers and statisticians with specific
software support and sampling issues.  

School crime 

BJS, in collaboration with the National
Center for Education Statistics (NCES),
periodically collects data on aspects of
school crime through a supplement to the
NCVS.  From January 1, 2001, to July 31,
2001, household members age 12 or older
who attended school were asked questions 
about their school environment. These data 
represent about 27 million students.  

Information was obtained on the availability
of drugs at school, existence of street
gangs, prevalence of gang fights, presence
of guns at school, victimizations, and fear 
of being attacked or harmed.  The results 
of the 2001 School Crime Supplement will be
included in the joint BJS/NCES publication,
Indicators of School Crime and Safety, 2002, 
which is expected to be released in fall 
2002.  Latest data are available in
Indicators of School Crime and Safety,
2001, released 10/01 (NCJ 190075).

Victimization of the disabled

Workplace violence 

BJS, in collaboration with the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health, is currently collecting data to
measure the circumstances surrounding
incidents involving violence in the
workplace.  The survey, through an NCVS
supplement, provides a detailed
description and assessment of workplace
incidents and work-related risk factors,
including the work tasks being performed
at the time of victimization, the specific
location within the workplace where the
victimization occurred, the specific work
relationship of the victim to the offender,
the presence/use About half the violent 
victimizations that American Indians
experienced involved victims and offenders 
who had a prior relationship, about the 
same percentage as for all violent
victimizations.of work-place violence
prevention strategies, or the actions of 
the victim and their impact on the outcome 
or severity of the attack.  

Latest data on the extent of workplace
crime in the United States are available 
in Workplace Violence, 1993-99, released 
12/01 (NCJ 190076).

Cybercrime statistics

Cybercrime Statistics Program, initiated in
2001,is designed to measure changes in the
incidence, magnitude, and consequences
of electronic or cybercrime. Cybercrime
statistics will include data on both
personal and property crimes, ranging from
e-mail threats and harassment to illegal use
of or access to networks to commit fraud or
theft.  In July 2001 BJS added items to the
National Crime Victimization Survey to learn
about frauds, identify thefts, and stalking
experienced as a consequence of use of the
Internet.  

In FY 2002 BJS has initiated its first 
pretest of a commercial victimization 
survey in nearly 30 years, focusing on 
the exposure to computer crime among 
businesses engaging in e-commerce.  In FY 
2003 BJS will carry out the full survey 
entailing data collection from a 
representative sample of approximately 
36,000 businesses nationwide.

In addition, a series of questions relat-
ing to computer crime were added to the 
2001 National Survey of Prosecutors, which
collected data from 2,355 State court
prosecutors who handle felony cases in
State courts of general jurisdiction. The 
BJS Bulletin Prosecutors in State Courts, 
2001 (NCJ 193441) was released 5/02. BJS 
will also collect information on cybercrime
offenses on its 2003 Survey of Inmates in
State and Federal Correctional Facilities,
and on its next Law Enforcement Management 
Survey, also scheduled for FY 2003. 

Intimate partner victimization

Summary findings --

*  In 1999 females experienced an estimated 
671,110 rape, sexual assault, robbery, 
aggravated assault, and simple assault 
victimizations at the hands of an intimate, 
down from 1.1 million in 1993. Women were
victimized in 85% of the intimate partner
violent crimes in 1999.

*  Between 1993 and 1999, the overall 
rate of intimate partner violence
against all females decreased 41% from 
10 to 6 victimizations per 1,000 females 
age 12 or older. 

*  Females were more likely than males 
to be murdered by an intimate partner 
in 1999.  

*  Between 1993 and 1999 women age 16 to
24 experienced the highest per capita 
rates of intimate  violence.

Data and trends in intimate partner
victimization are collected as part of the
NCVS, which asks victims of violence about
the offender, their relationship to the
offender, and characteristics of the
victimization incidents.  Asking the victim
about his/her relationship to the offender 
is critical to determining whether the crime
occurred between intimates (current or
former spouses, girlfriends, or boyfriends).  

Using data from the NCVS and the FBI's
Supplementary Homicide Reports, BJS
published Intimate Partner Violence and
Age of Victim, 1993-99 in October 2001
(NCJ 187635).  The report presents trends
in intimate violence, characteristics of
victims (race, gender, age, income,
ethnicity, and whether the victims live in
urban, suburban, or rural areas), type of
crime (physical assault or verbal threats),
and trends for reporting to police with a
focus on the victims' age.  Intimate
victimizations measured include murder,
rape, sexual assault, robbery, aggravated
assault, and simple assault.  

Justice system response to 
domestic violence cases

In 2002 BJS will conduct a study of case-
processing flows through the criminal
justice system for domestic violence
offenses.  Representative data from the 
75 largest counties will be collected in 
which an estimated 16,000 domestic violence
cases will be tracked from time of arrest,
through prosecution, to conviction and
sentencing. Information will be obtained 
on the types of sentences imposed for
domestic violence, including contingencies
associated with supervision in the
community under sentences to probation. 

Factors that increase or decrease the
likelihood of conviction will be carefully
documented. Apart from varying legal
provisions, these factors may include the
following:  the victim-offender relationship,
criminal histories of victim and offender,
policies regarding issuance and enforcement 
of restraining orders, prosecutorial policies 
regarding domestic violence cases, and 
pretrial release and sentencing practices in 
the jurisdiction. 

Homicide trends 

Summary findings --

*  The homicide rate doubled from the mid
1960's to the late 1970's.  In 1980 it peaked
at 10.2 per 100,000 population and
subsequently fell off to 7.9 per 100,000 in
1985.  It rose again in the late 1980's and
early 1990's to another peak in 1991 of 9.8
per 100,000.  Afterwards the rate declined
sharply, reaching 5.7 per 100,000 by 1999.

Based on data for 1976-99 -- 

*  Blacks are disproportionately represented 
as both homicide victims and offenders. In 
terms of rates per 100,000, blacks are 6 times 
more likely to be victimized and 8 times more 
likely to commit homicide than are whites. 
 
*  Males represent three-quarters of homicide
victims and nearly 90% of offenders. In terms 
of rates per 100,000, males are 3 times more 
likely than females to be killed and 8 times 
more likely to kill. 

*  Approximately a third of murder victims 
and almost half the offenders are under age 25. 
For both victims and offenders, the rate per 
100,000 peaks in the 18-to-24 age group.

Homicide trend data are updated annually
on the BJS website.  Homicide is of interest
not only because of its severity but also
because it is a reliable barometer of trends
in violence.  Among the most important
and well-recorded data on crime are the
incident-level Supplementary Homicide
Reports (SHR) collected by the FBI on each
recorded homicide.  

State and local law enforcement agencies
submit data about each homicide to the FBI. 
These data include detail on the jurisdictional 
location, victim and offender characteristics 
(age, race, and gender), and the relationship 
of the victim to the offender. Topics covered 
on the BJS website include long-term trends, 
demographic trends, multiple victims and 
offenders, infanticide, eldercide, homicides 
by intimates, law enforcement officers killed, 
weapons trends, regional trends, and trends by 
city size.
  
Data from the 2000 trends will be available
in summer 2002.  The BJS site on homicide
trends is located at <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/
bjs/homicide/homtrnd.htm>.

The justice system

Law enforcement

BJS collects data about Federal, State, and
local law enforcement agencies and their
activities.  

Recent findings include --

*  As of June 2000, Federal agencies employed 
about 88,496 full-time personnel authorized to 
make arrests and carry firearms.  Of all 
Federal officers, 14.4% were women, and 30.5% 
were members of a racial or ethnic minority. 

*  As of June 1999, local police departments 
had an estimated 556,631 full-time employees, 
including about 436,000 sworn personnel. 
Sheriffs' departments had 290,707 full-time
employees, including about 186,000 sworn
personnel.  
 
*  From 1987 to 1997 minority representation 
among local police officers increased from 
14.6% to 21.5%. In sheriffs' departments, 
minorities accounted for 19% of sworn 
personnel in 1997 compared to 13.4% 10 
years earlier.   
 
Census of State and Local Law
Enforcement Agencies collects data from
all State and local law enforcement
agencies employing one or more persons
with general arrest powers.  This data
collection provides the Nation's most
complete enumeration of police agencies,
including information about community
policing, personnel, operations, and 
the use of information systems.  Detailed 
findings from the 2000 data collection will 
be available in summer 2002.

Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) Survey
collects data from over 3,000 State and 
local law enforcement agencies, including 
all those that employ 100 or more sworn
officers and a nationally representative
sample of smaller agencies.  Data are
obtained on the organization and
administration of police and sheriffs'
departments, including agency responsibilities, 
operating expenditures, job functions of sworn 
and civilian employees, and officer salaries 
and special pay.  Also collected is information 
on demographic characteristics of officers, 
sidearms and nonlethal weapons, education and 
training requirements, computers and information
systems, vehicles, special units, community
policing activities, and agencies’ written
policies.

Recent findings are available in --

*  Police Departments in Large Cities,
1990-2000, released 5/02 (NCJ 175703) 
*  Local Police Departments, 1999, released

Survey of Campus Law Enforcement Agencies 
provides data describing nearly 600 campus 
law enforcement agencies serving 4-year 
universities or colleges with 2,500 or more 
students.  Data are collected on agency 
personnel, expenditures and pay, operations, 
equipment, computers and information systems, 
policies, and special programs.  

Federal Law Enforcement Agency
Census provides national data on Federal
law enforcement agencies with arrest and
firearms authority.  Data collected include
the number of officers working in the areas
of criminal investigation and enforcement,
police patrol and response, security and
protection, court operations, and
corrections, by agency and State.  Latest
data are available in Federal Law
Enforcement Officers, 2000, released 7/01
(NCJ 187231).

Police Public Contact Survey collects data
on police and citizen contacts including the
nature of the police-citizen contact,
respondent perceptions as to whether any
force encountered was excessive, and any
provocative actions that the respondent may
have initiated during the encounter.  In
addition, the questionnaire included a new
section to gather information on
police-initiated stops for routine traffic
violations. This supplemental survey to the
NCVS addresses the mandate set forth by
the Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Act of 1994 to collect,
evaluate, and publish data on the use of
excessive force by law enforcement
personnel. The survey will be fielded during
the last 6 months of 2002.  Latest findings
can be found in Characteristics of Drivers
Stopped by Police, 1999, released 3/02
(NCJ 191548) and Contacts Between Police
and Public: Findings from the 1999 National
Survey, released 2/01 (NCJ 184957).

Traffic stop statistics come from the Police
Public Contact Survey, summarizing the
frequency and nature of traffic stops, with
specific focus on interactions between police
and citizens, as well as incidents in which
officers used or threatened to use force
against a respondent.  Questions regarding
police-public contacts during traffic stops
focus on four main areas: 1) reason for the
traffic stop; 2) vehicle and/or personal
searches conducted; 3) outcome of the
traffic stop; and 4) use or threat of force
during the contact.  In addition, this year 
the survey has been expanded to include
questions regarding respondents’ usual
driving behavior, as well as driver behavior
during the traffic stop. The next data 
collection will be conducted during the 
last 6 months of 2002.

Survey of State Police Traffic Stop Data
Collection Procedures collects data on
State police agency policies for recording
demographic information on traffic-related
contacts and violations. The questionnaire,
first fielded in March 1999, obtained basic
information from State law enforcement
agencies on the circumstances under which
demographic data were collected for
traffic-related stops and whether this
information was stored in an electronically
accessible format.  

Latest findings are reported in Traffic 
Stop and Data Collection Policies for State 
Police, 2001, released 12/01 (NCJ 191158).

Policing and homicide study provides
data on justifiable homicides by police
reported under the FBI’s Supplementary
Homicide Reporting Program, including
annual trends from 1976 to 1996 in two
types of homicide:  justifiable homicides 
of felons by police and murders of police
officers by felons.  Findings include the
number and rate of justifiable homicides by
police, demographic characteristics of
officers who justifiably kill, characteristics 
of felons who are justifiably killed (gender,
race, and age), the number and rate of
murders of police officers, demographic
characteristics of the murdered officers, 
and characteristics of felons who murdered
officers (gender, race, and age). Also
included are descriptions of actual cases 
of justifiable homicides by police in 1996 
and descriptions of actual cases of murders 
of police officers in 1996.  Findings are 
reported in Policing and Homicide, 1976-96: 
Justifiable Homicide of Felons by Police and 
Murder of Police by Felons, released 3/01 
(NCJ 180987).

Survey of DNA Crime Laboratories, collects 
data from all public and private DNA
laboratories on management and administrative 
statistics, including staff size and 
characteristics, staff training, budgets,
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing
procedures, processing policies, and
archival capacity.  The survey also obtains
information on the degree of laboratory
compliance with national standards and
participation in the national database of
DNA samples. 
 
Findings are useful to crime laboratory
directors to compare procedures and
capacities among laboratories, as well as 
to measure compatibility between the 
national DNA database, referred to as CODIS, 
and State DNA databases.  Latest data are
available in Survey of DNA Crime
Laboratories, 2001, released 1/02 (NCJ
191191).

Survey of Forensic Crime Laboratories,
to be conducted for the first time in 2002,
will provide a national assessment of the
workloads of the State and local crime labs
and variations in laboratory policies,
practices, and procedures.  Data will be
collected on organizational issues such as
staffing and budget; policies and procedures, 
including chain-of-custody; the number and 
sources of cases/ evidence received; backlogs 
in processing of cases; and contracting of 
work to private laboratories.  Additional 
information will be collected on technology, 
equipment, and processes used for interaction 
with other criminal justice agencies.  The 
survey will involve all of the approximately 
400 publicly funded crime labs in the Nation.

Census of Law Enforcement Training Academies,
to be conducted in 2002, will for the first time 
obtain information on the number and types of 
staff employed at the training facilities, budget, 
sources of funds, number of officers trained, and
policies and practices. In addition to basic
organizational data, the survey will gather
data on training issues which are critical to
current law enforcement policy
development.

Prosecution

BJS collects data on State and Federal
prosecutors and the cases they prosecute. 

Summary findings  --

*  Over the past decade prosecutors'
offices nationwide, on average, experienced 
increases in their staff size, budget for 
prosecutorial functions, and population 
served.
  
*  In 2001 chief prosecutors were much
more likely to serve in a full-time 
capacity than 10 years ago.
  
*  The percentage of prosecutors' offices
prosecuting felonies related to domestic
violence, child abuse, and bank or thrift
fraud increased in 2001 compared to 1993,
when similar data were collected.
  
*  Over the 12 months preceding the 2001
survey, 42% of prosecutors' offices reported
prosecuting either felony or misdemeanor
computer-related crimes under their State's
computer crime statutes.
  
*  Two-thirds of prosecutors' offices used
DNA evidence during plea negotiations or
felony trials in 2001, compared to about 
half of the offices in 1996.

*  In 2001 about 23% of offices assigned
prosecutors to handle community-related
activities.

National Survey of Prosecutors collects
data on resources, policies, and practices 
of local prosecutors from a nationally
representative sample of chief litigating
prosecutors in State court systems.  The
survey obtains basic information on staffing
and operations and collects data on current
topics such as the use of innovative
prosecution techniques, intermediate
sanctions, juvenile cases transferred to
criminal court, and work-related assaults
and threats.  Findings from the 2001 survey
were released in May 2002.

Courts and sentencing

BJS collects data about the Nation's court
systems, including information about both
civil and criminal courts, the cases brought,
and their outcomes.  

Summary findings --

Pretrial release and detention
*  An estimated 64% of defendants charged
with a felony in the 75 most populated
counties in May 1998 were released from
jail pending disposition of their case.   

*  About a third of released defendants
were either rearrested for a new offense,
failed to appear in court as scheduled, or
committed some other violation that 
resulted in the revocation of their pretrial
release.

Criminal case processing and 
sentencing
*  In 1998 State and Federal Courts
convicted a combined total of nearly
980,000 adults of felonies.

*  State courts convicted almost
928,000 adults of a felony in 1998. 

*  From 1988 to 1998 the number of
felony convictions increased faster
than the number of arrests. Sixty-eight
percent of those convicted in 1998 were 
sentenced to incarceration.
 
*  Just over 50% of felony defendants 
were convicted of a felony, and 15% were 
convicted of a misdeamnor.  Among those 
convicted, 96% were by a plea.

Civil justice
*  In 1996 in the 75 largest counties in 
the United States, an estimated 15,638 
tort, contract, and real property cases 
were disposed by trial. About 70% of 
these cases were decided by a jury.
 
*  Individuals were plaintiffs in 82% of 
all trial cases disposed of during 1996.  
Individuals sued businesses in 37% and 
other individuals in an additional
34% of all trial cases.

*  Overall, plaintiffs won in 52% of trial
cases.  An estimated $3 billion in
compensatory and punitive damages were
awarded to plaintiff winners in trial cases.

National Judicial Reporting Program (NJRP), 
conducted every 2 years, surveys a nationwide 
sample of felony trial courts and
collects detailed information on
demographic characteristics of felons,
conviction offenses, type of sentences,
sentence lengths, and amount of time from
arrest to conviction and sentencing. 
Findings from the 1998 data collection can
be found in State Court Sentencing of
Convicted Felons, 1998, released 12/01
(NCJ 190637); and Felony Sentences in
State Courts, 1998, released 10/01 (NCJ
190103).  Forthcoming reports include
Felony Sentences in State Courts, 2000,
which is expected to be released in late
2002.

State Court Processing Statistics (SCPS)
provides data on the criminal justice
processing of persons charged with felonies
in a representative sample of felony
defendants in the 75 largest counties. 
These counties account for about half of
serious crime nationwide.  The program
tracks felony defendants from charging by
the prosecutor until disposition in their 
cases or for a maximum of 12 months.  

Data are obtained on demographic characteristics, 
arrest offense(s), criminal justice status at 
time of arrest, prior arrests and convictions, 
bail and pretrial release decisions, court 
appearance record, re-arrest while on pretrial 
release, type and outcome of adjudication, and 
type and length of sentence if convicted. Recent 
data are included in Felony Defendants in Large
Urban Counties, 1998, released 11/01 (NCJ
187232). The 2000 data are expected to be
released in fall 2002.

State Court Statistics Project, conducted
in collaboration with the National Center for
State Courts, provides data on State
appellate and trial court caseloads for the 
50 States, the District of Columbia, and 
Puerto Rico.  Information is reported on case 
type, case filings, case processing, 
disposition, and appellate opinions.  Data 
on State appellate caseloads are divided into
mandatory and discretionary cases.

Data on trial court caseloads include
information about criminal cases,
nondomestic civil cases, domestic cases,
juvenile cases, and cases involving traffic
and other violations of local ordinance.  
Data will be collected for reference year 
2001 in summer 2002.  Latest data are available 
in State Court Caseload Statistics, 2001,
(National Center for State Courts, 2001) and
Examining the Work of State Courts, 2001.

Survey of State Court Organization, conducted 
by the National Center for State Courts, 
provides basic descriptive information relating 
to the Nation's State court systems. Information 
is collected on the following characteristics --

*  trial courts -- the role of grand juries,
peremptory jury challenges, jury verdict
rules 
*  appellate courts -- case selection,
expedited procedures 
*  governance of court systems -- 
budgets, administration 
*  judges and judicial selection -- 
numbers of judges, mandatory judicial 
education 
*  processing of criminal cases  -
felony definition, mandatory minimum 
sentences, habitual offender sentencing 
provisions. 
 
Latest data are available in State Court
Organization, 1998 (NCJ 178932).  

Civil Justice Survey of State Courts
collects information for a 1-year period 
on tort, contract, and real property rights 
cases disposed by jury or bench trial in 
State courts of general jurisdiction in 46 
counties chosen to represent the Nation's 
75 most populous counties.  Data collected 
include trial type, case type, plaintiff 
and defendant types, economic and noneconomic
damages awarded, punitive damages awarded, 
and dates of filing and disposition. Data for 
the 2001 Civil Justice Survey are currently 
being collected.

Tribal criminal justice statistics

Tribal Justice Statistics Assistance
Center (TJSAC), funded by BJS and
administered by the Justice Research and
Statistics Association, provides technical
assistance and training to American Indian
and Native Alaska jurisdictions to improve
their criminal justice statistical systems.  
The Center delivers assistance via a toll free
number, a website, statistical training
sessions, and a variety of publications about
collecting, reporting, and utilizing crime
statistics in Indian Country.

Criminal Victimization Studies in Indian
Country are projected for the reservations
of the Zuni, Umatilla, and Southern Ute
people.  BJS is currently working with the
American Indian Development Associates,
National Indian Justice Center, and the
University of California at Irvine to conduct
these studies.  The studies will measure the
incidence and rates of crime on the
reservations and examine the role of alcohol
in violent crime victimizations and the
characteristics of domestic violence
incidents.

Census of Tribal Justice Agencies in
American Indian and Alaska Native Tribal
Jurisdictions, to be conducted in 2002, will
obtain baseline information about tribal
justice institutions including prosecution,
court systems, and other forms of dispute
resolution.  Data also will be collected on
information/case management systems and
statistical reporting capabilities.

Annual Survey of Jails in Indian Country
collects data from all 69 confinement
facilities, detention centers, jails, and 
other facilities operated by tribal 
authorities or the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  
The survey covers rated capacity, facility 
crowding, plans for renovation and building, 
inmate characteristics, and numbers of the 
following -- adults and juveniles held, 
persons under community supervision, admissions 
and discharges in the last 30 days, and inmate
deaths.  The annual report, Jails in Indian
Country, 2001, released 5/02 (NCJ 193400), 
presents the latest data.
 
Federal justice statistics 

BJS collects annual data on workload,
activities, and case outcomes in the
Federal justice system. 

Summary findings --

Prosecution 
*  U.S. attorneys opened matters for
investigation against 123,559 suspects
during fiscal year 2000.

*  Of the 117,450 suspects in matters
concluded during 2000, 74% were referred
for prosecution either before a U.S. district
court judge (62%) or a U.S. magistrate
(12%).  Nearly all (97%) of those
investigated for immigration offenses were
referred for prosecution. 

Pretrial 
*  More than half (53.7%) of defendants
charged with a Federal offense were
released following the initial court
appearance, provided that any
court-imposed conditions were satisfied.

*  Most (81.7%) defendants released
before trial completed their pretrial release
without violating the release conditions;
6.7% had their release revoked. 

*  Defendants charged with violent or drug
offenses were less likely to satisfactorily
complete the period of pretrial release
without a violation (77% and 72%,
respectively) than other defendants. 

Adjudication 
*  During 2000, criminal cases were
commenced against 83,251 defendants in
U.S. district court.  Most (85%) were
charged with a felony offense.  Cases 
were terminated against 76,952 defendants
during 2000.  Most (89%)defendants were
convicted.

Sentencing 
*  Of the 68,156 defendants convicted and
sentenced during 2000, 73% were sentenced 
to a term of imprisonment (either alone or 
in conjunction with probation), 18% were 
sentenced to probation (either alone or
with incarceration), and 4% were sentenced
to pay a fine alone. 
 
*  The mean prison sentence imposed
during 2000 was 57 months. Defendants
convicted of weapons felonies (92 months),
violent felo- nies (87 months), and drug
felonies (76 months), received the longest
prison terms on average.
 
Corrections 
*  During 2000 the Federal Bureau of
Prisons received 49,678 inmates from
U.S. district courts; an additional
15,240 inmates were received from other
sources such as community supervision
violations; 55,876 inmates were released 
during the year.  As of September 30, 
2000, 129,329 sentenced offenders were 
under the jurisdiction of the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons. 

Federal Justice Statistics Program
reports on all aspects of processing in 
the Federal justice system, including the
number of persons investigated, prosecuted,
convicted, incarcerated, sentenced to
probation, released pretrial, and under
parole or other supervision; initial
prosecution decisions; referrals to
magistrates; court dispositions; sentencing
outcomes; sentence length; and time served.  
The data are available for online analysis at 
<www.fjsrc.urban. org>.  The series also

Corrections

BJS collects data about the Nation's
correctional system from over 1,500 Federal
and State adult correctional facilities, 
3,300 local jails, and 5,800 probation and 
parole agencies and offices.  By extracting
comparable data over time, these programs
provide measures of how these correctional
populations and agencies have changed. 

Summary findings  --

*  6.5 million adults were on probation, in 
jail or prison, or on parole at yearend 
2000   3.1% of all U.S. adult residents.
 
*  Two-thirds of the 6.5 million were under
supervision in the community.
 
*  State and Federal prison authorities had
1,381,892 inmates under their jurisdiction
at yearend 2000.

*  Local jails held or supervised 621,149
adults awaiting trial or serving a sentence
at midyear 2000.

*  Between 1995 and midyear 2001, the
jail and prison population nationwide grew
an average 4.0% annually.  The number
under State jurisdiction rose 0.3% during
the 12-month period ending June 30, 2001
-- the smallest annual growth rate in 28
years.  The number of inmates under
Federal jurisdiction rose 7.2%.
 
Quarterly Data Collection on Deaths in
Custody currently implements provisions of
the Deaths in Custody Reporting Act of
2000 (PL 106-297), which requires a
collection of data on all deaths of persons
held in local jails, State prisons, and juvenile
correctional facilities, and of those persons
"in the process of arrest.”  Since October
2001 BJS has received quarterly reports on
inmate deaths in both local jails and State
prisons.  In July 2002 BJS will add juvenile
correctional facilities to these collections.  

Data elements cover the personal background 
of the deceased inmate (date of birth, gender, 
race, ethnic origin, admission date, and 
current offenses), as well as the date, time, 
location, and cause of death. BJS is also 
exploring methods to collect data on deaths 
occurring during the "process of arrest."  
BJS is currently working with the FBI to 
establish the best means of collecting these 
data nationwide.

National Prisoner Statistics Program
produces yearend and midyear National-
and State-level data on the numbers of
prisoners in State and Federal prison
facilities.  It also provides data on the
number of admissions and releases during
the year, the race and Hispanic origin of 
inmates, the number of inmate deaths by
cause, and the number known to be HIV 
positive. Recent data are reported in
Prisoners in 2000, released 8/01 (NCJ 
188207). 

Capital punishment series yields annual 
National- and State-level data on persons
sentenced to death and those executed. Data
collected include offender demographic 
characteristics, prior criminal history, 
criminal justice system status at the time 
of the capital offense, and date of sentence.  
Data are available on executions since 1930 
and on sentencing since 1973. The data series 
also includes annual information from each 
jurisdiction on statutory changes relating to 
the death penalty, including changes involving
additional aggravating or mitigating
circumstances, procedural amendments, and 
revisions to capital offenses.  Recent data 
are reported in Capital Punishment 2000, 
released 12/01 (NCJ 190598).

National Corrections Reporting Program
annually collects individual-level data on
prison admissions and releases and on
parole entries and discharges in
participating jurisdictions.  Demographic
information, conviction offense, sentence
length, type of admission, method of
release, and actual time served of inmates
exiting prison and parole are collected 
from individual records.  The latest data 
will be available on CD-ROM:  National 
Corrections Reporting Program, 1999 (NCJ 
192868), expected release 6/02.

and local probation or parole supervision.  
Key data elements include the number on 
probation and parole at yearend, number of 
entries and exits (by type), offender demo- 
graphic characteristics, severity of offense, 
type of supervision, and special programs.  
Latest data are available in the release 
for probation and parole, 2000, on 8/01 
(NCJ 188208).

Annual Survey of Jails provides estimates
of the number of inmates by gender, race,
Hispanic origin, conviction status, and
juvenile/adult status.  It also collects
information on the rated capacity of 
facilities in each jurisdiction, and 
separate counts of offenders under community 
supervision by jail staff, including those 
under electronic monitoring and home detention, 
in alternative work programs, day-reporting
programs, community service or weekender
programs, or other alternative programs. 
The latest data are available in Prison and
Jail Inmates at Midyear 2001, released 4/02
(NCJ 191702).

Surveys of Inmates in State and Federal
Correctional Facilities provide detailed
data on individual characteristics of 
prison inmates, current offenses and 
sentences, characteristics of victims, 
criminal histories, family background, gun 
possession and use, prior drug and alcohol 
use and treatment, and educational programs 
and other services provided while in prison. 

Last conducted in 1997, the surveys
obtained data from personal interviews with
a nationally representative sample of about
14,300 State prison inmates and 4,000
Federal inmates in 275 State prisons and 40
Federal prisons.  Numerous reports
presenting the 1997 data have been released. 
The next survey will be conducted in 2003. 

Survey of Inmates in Local Jails collects
data on the local jail population, including
the personal and family characteristics of 
jail inmates, current offenses, sentences and
time served, criminal histories, jail 
activities, conditions and programs, prior 
drug and alcohol use and treatment, and health 
care services provided while in jail. The latest
survey was conducted in early 2002. Findings 
are expected for release in 2003.

Survey of Adults on Probation provides
detailed information on the background and
characteristics of a representative national
sample of probationers under supervision in
the community.  Specific areas of inquiry
include criminal history, prior drug and
alcohol use, participation in drug and
alcohol treatment programs, use of firearms,
the conditions of supervision, and the extent
of contact with probation authorities.

Census of Jails obtains information on the
inmate population, including inmates
supervised in the community, persons held
for other authorities, admissions and
discharges, and inmate programs, health
services, and screening for HIV and
tuberculosis infection, and inmate deaths;
staff characteristics and reports of inmate
assaults on staff; and facility character-
istics, including function and construction 
and renovation data.  The latest data can be
found in Census of Jails 1999, released 9/01
(NCJ 186633); and Prison and Jail Inmates
at Midyear 2001, released 4/02 (NCJ
191702).

Census of State and Local Probation and
Parole Agencies is a complete census of
Federal, State, and locally operated
probation and parole agencies. The census
gathers data on staffing, expenditures,
program operation and participation levels,
and drug and HIV-testing policies and
programs.  The census serves as the
sampling frame for the national Survey of
Adults on Probation. The next survey will 
be conducted in 2003.

Census of State and Federal Correctional
Facilities provides detailed information 
on facility characteristics, including 
design and rated capacity, construction 
and renovation, and facilities under court 
order for conditions of confinement; inmate 
counts, persons under age 18 and over age 
55,inmate housing arrangements, and inmates

and screening for HIV and tuberculosis; 
facility programs, such as work, education, 
and counseling; and staff characteristics,
including occupation and ethnicity. Data
from the 2000 census is expected to be
released in fall 2002.

Association of State Corrections
Administrators (ASCA) Performance
Measures Project, sponsored by BJS, 
National Institute of Justice, and 
the OJP Corrections Program Office, 
is undertaking a 21/2-year effort to 
improve correctional information systems.  
The project is building upon findings 
from the report State and Federal 
Corrections Information Systems (NCJ 
170016).  This report provided a baseline 
for developing outcome measures and an 
assessment of the capacity of existing 
systems to produce accurate, comparable 
data.  As a followup, this project has 
identified eight correctional performance 
measures and selected a subset of four
measures for development and improvement.  
A project consultant and advisory panel 
have assisted ASCA members in reaching 
common definitions and counting rules for 
the categories being measured.  The next 
phase of the project will involve the 
project consultant working with ASCA 
members to determine the capability of 
capturing performance measures data 
electronically.  

Recidivism Survey of Released Prisoners
provides national estimates of the recidivism
rate of prisoners released in selected years. 
In the survey, samples of released prisoners
are tracked for 3 years, and data are
compiled on the percentage of them that are
rearrested, reconvicted, or reimprisoned for
new crimes within the three-year follow-up
period. The various recidivism measures are
based on official criminal history records
maintained by each State and the FBI. BJS
is currently analyzing a sample of State
prison releases from 15 States with
oversampling of violent offenders,
particularly those convicted of sexual
assault and crimes against children.  These
15 States collectively accounted for
two-thirds of all releases from prisons
throughout the Nation in 1994.  An initial
report is expected in summer 2002.

State Prison Expenditures, 2001 will
analyze data supplied by State finance
officers to the U.S. Census Bureau in its
annual Census of Government Finances. 
The report will summarize data on State
outlays for prison salaries, wages and
employee benefits; capital expenditures;
and costs of utilities, medical care, food
service, and contractual housing of inmates. 
Data are currently being collected for 2001. 
An earlier BJS report, State Prison
Expenditures, 1996, was released in August
1999 (NCJ 172211).

Expenditure and employment

BJS provides expenditure and employment
data from Federal, State, and local criminal
justice agencies nationwide.  These data
provide critical information to the
formula-based programs within OJP that
allocate funds based on State and local
criminal justice spending.

Summary findings --

*  States now spend more on criminal justice
than municipalities, counties, or the Federal
Government.  Direct expenditures for each
of the major criminal justice functions
(police, corrections, judicial) are increasing. 

*  In fiscal year 1999 Federal, State, and
local governments spent more than $146
billion for civil and criminal justice, an 8%
increase over 1998. The three levels of
government together spent a total of $521
per resident. 

*  In fiscal year 1999 State and local
governments combined spent 85% of all
justice dollars; the Federal government
spent the rest. 

*  The Federal Government alone spent
more than $22 billion on criminal and civil
justice in 1999, compared to almost $50
billion by State governments, $35 billion by
counties, and $39 billion by municipalities. 

Justice Expenditure and Employment
Extracts series obtains data extracted 
from the Census Bureau's Annual Government
Finance Survey and Annual Survey of
Public Employment.  This series includes
National and State-by-State estimates of
government expenditures and employment
for the following justice categories: 
police protection, all judicial (including 
prosecution, courts, and public defense), 
and corrections. Federal data for the same 
categories are also included, as are data 
for the largest local governments (counties 
with populations of 500,000 or more and 
cities with populations of 300,000 or more).  
The latest data are available in Justice
Expenditure and Employment in the United
States, 1999, released 2/02 (NCJ 191746).

Justice Expenditure and Employment
Survey (also referred to as Justice
Assistance Data Survey) collects detailed
information on the costs of the justice
system, including police protection, 
courts, prosecution, public defense, and
corrections. This survey, funded by the
Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), is the
only source of the variable passthrough data
(VPT) required by the States for their
allocation to local governments of the BJA
Edward Byrne Memorial State and Local Law 
Enforcement Grant Program. 

These VPT data prescribe the minimum
amount of each State’s block grants that,
under law, are to be “passed through” to
local governments in the State. The VPT 
is based on the ratio of State to local 
spending for criminal justice from "own 
revenue sources;" that is, expenditures 
from tax receipts, user fees, bond 
distributions, and so on, are included, 
but expenditures from funds received from 
other governments such as Federal grant 
programs are excluded.  The latest data 
are available in Justice Variable Pass 
through Data,1997, released 11/01 (NCJ 
190359).

Expenditure and employment data from
other BJS sources include those BJS
series that collect agency-based
employment and expenditure data to
develop workload measures, ratios of
employees to clients, and ratios of 
dollars per service delivered. These 
include Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics, National 
Survey of Prosecutors, various court 
statistics series, the Census of Local 
Jails, and the Census of State and Federal 
Correctional Facilities. The estimates 
produced from these sources may differ 
from those produced by the CJEE because 
of distinct collection methods, units
of analysis, and data collection purposes.

Drugs, alcohol, and crime

Many of BJS's ongoing statistical data
series collect drug- and alcohol-related
information. 

Summary findings --

*  Based on victim perceptions, about 1.2
million violent crimes occurred each year
in which victims reported that the offender
had been drinking.  For about 1 in 4 of
these violent victimizations involving
alcohol use by the offender, victims
believed the offender was also using 
drugs at the time of the offense. 

*  Among probationers surveyed in 1995,
14% reported they were on drugs when
they committed their offense. 

*  33% of State prisoners and 22% of
Federal prisoners said they had committed
their current offense while under the
influence of drugs, as reported in 1997. 
Drug offenders (42%) and property
offenders (37%) reported the highest
incidence of drug use at the time of the
offense. 

*  36% of convicted jail inmates said they
were using drugs at the time of their
offense in 1998.  Those jail inmates
convicted of drug trafficking (60%), drug
possession (57%), fraud (45%), or robbery
(44%) were most likely to have reported to
be using drugs at the time of the offense. 

*  In 1996, 16% of convicted jail inmates
said they had committed their offense to
get money for drugs. Of convicted property
and drug offenders, about 1 in 4 had
committed their crimes to get money for
drugs.

*  In 1997, 19% of State prisoners and
16% of Federal inmates said they
committed their current offense to obtain
money for drugs.  

*  Drug prosecutions comprised an
increasing proportion of the Federal
criminal caseload C from 21% of
defendants during 1982 to 36% during
1999. In 1998 drug offenders comprised a
third of all persons convicted of a 
felony in State courts. Drug traffickers 
accounted for 21% of all convicted felons; 
drug possessors also accounted for 13% 
of all convicted felons. 

International statistics

Through the International Statistics Program
BJS cooperates with other countries and the
United Nations to improve the collection of
statistics on crime and criminal justice
systems.  A long-term goal is to enable
cross-national comparisons and examination 
of the relationship between crime trends in 
the United States and those in other countries.  

World Factbook of Criminal Justice Systems 
at <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/wfcj.htm> 
provides narrative descriptions of the criminal 
justice systems of more than 40 countries. These
descriptions, available electronically through
the BJS Internet site, are written to a
common template to facilitate comparisons. 
In 2002 BJS will expand the World Factbook
with justice system profiles of four additional
Latin American countries.

Methodological research and studies

BJS conducts, supports, and implements
methodological research and initiatives
designed to improve the quality of justice
statistics, records, and information 
systems. 

Improving measurement methods

Under the aegis of the American Statistical
Association (ASA), BJS has launched a
methodological research program designed 
to foster improvements in the methods used 
to obtain, analyze, and report national level 
data on crime and criminal justice. In 2002 
BJS is supporting or will support the 
following studies designed to yield new 
insights to affect current practice.  

Methodological and research issues related
to developing a National Computer Crime
Estimate. BJS plans to initiate and 
maintain an ongoing national statistical 
program in 2002 focused on measuring the 
magnitude and consequences of computer 
crime. Researchers will be encouraged to 
explore the issues in developing the 
methods, definitions, and protocols to 
obtain nationally representative data. The
program will encompass criminal activities
involving computers or computer networks
and the response of the criminal justice
system to violations of computer crime
statutes.  

Variation in victim reporting of crimes to
the police.  This methodological research
addresses respondent memory and willingness 
to report victimization experiences to 
interviewers for the NCVS. The researchers 
will use the longitudinal features of the NCVS 
to examine reporting of victimization 
experiences as well as examining small area 
variations with regards to the respondent's 
place of residence. Examining characteristics 
of the respondent's residential area may yield
insights into reporting variations. Accounting 
for these variations and their effects on 
estimates of national victimization rates is 
the first step toward better understanding the
nature of victims' reluctance to notify the 
police when a crime occurs.

Improvements to the FBI's UCR Program. 
A challenging problem faced by users of
summary crime data compiled under the
FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Program is
that not all jurisdictions fully report 
their crime data.  As a result, the FBI 
must estimate the volume of crime occurring 
in those cities and counties to produce a
national crime rate.  This research will
examine alternative ways to improve crime
estimates for those jurisdictions with
missing data.  

Specifically, the researchers will explore
such concerns as seasonality, techniques
for multi-year estimates, and patterns of
stability in the prior reports of "missing-
data" jurisdictions.  The research should be 
of significant benefit to the FBI in 
considering new ways of addressing missing and 
incomplete data from law enforcement agencies.

Police agency under-reporting of bias crimes. 
BJS has sponsored a project with Northeastern
University to better understand the decisions 
to categorize bias crime for the FBI reporting
program.  In some cases hate crimes are reported
to the police but are not recorded as such by 
local police statistics or by the UCR. The 
project focuses on quantifying the under-and
over-reporting of bias crimes in selected law
enforcement agencies.  Archival data analyses
and field interviews are used to help identify
both internal and external sources of reporting
error.

Visiting Research Fellowship Program

Under BJS sponsorship, researchers
selected as BJS Visiting Fellows come to
Washington, D.C., to conduct studies on
topics of their own choosing.  Fellows 
have access to the agency's rich array of 
datasets and software.  They interact with 
BJS staff and gain first-hand knowledge 
of some of the most recent developments in 
the field of criminal justice research. In 
addition to carrying out their research, 
fellows also have opportunities to contribute 
in other significant ways. 

For example, recent fellows have --

*  Briefed the Attorney General on latest
trends in youth violence
*  Collaborated on the creation of a BJS
homicide statistics website
*  Helped design a BJS survey on police use
of force
*  Explored new methods for visualizing BJS
data 
*  Compared crime rates between the U.S.
and England. 

The BJS Visiting Fellowship Program is
open to senior-level social science
researchers whose work on crime-related
subjects has been extensively published. 
Some fellows remain on-site at BJS for 
the entire duration of their project. Others 
make only occasional visits to accommodate 
their schedules. At the close of their visit, 
fellows prepare a research report summarizing
results and policy implications of their
project.


Support to State and local
governments

State Justice Statistics Program for
Statistical Analysis Centers

The State Justice Statistics Program
provides support to State Statistical 
Analysis Centers (SAC's) to collect, 
analyze, and report statistics on crime 
and justice to Federal, State, and local 
levels of government.  BJS works in 
conjunction with the Justice Research 
and Statistics Association (JRSA) and 
selected SAC directors to identify 
particular criminal justice topics of 
concern and significance to criminal 
justice practitioners.  SAC's are
encouraged to conduct statistical research
and in-depth analysis and to publish 
findings on these issues. 
 
In fiscal year 2002, BJS is 
encouraging SAC's to -- 

*  Establish a data collection mechanism to
gather information about deaths in police
custody
 
*  Conduct local crime victimization surveys
using software developed by BJS and COPS for 
local law enforcement organizations

*  Carry out special analyses utilizing
criminal history records to better
understand certain types of criminal
behavior or to evaluate the State’s use 
of such record systems

*  Undertake comprehensive studies of
domestic and sexual violence and the
response of the criminal justice system 

*  Examine the relationship between drugs
and crime and the management of drug
offenders by the justice system

*  Carry out data collection and analysis
involving cybercrime
 
*  Conduct studies and collect data relevant
to anti-terrorism initiatives at the local and
State level
 
*  Maximize access to reports and other
criminal justice information via the Internet 

*  Conduct research using incident-based
data obtained from local law enforcement
agencies
*  Promote research to better understand
the impact of corrections policies and
practices

*  Foster new research examining juvenile
violence and trends in juvenile offending.  

Further information on the fiscal year 2002
program are announced in the publication
State Justice Statistics Program for
Statistical Analysis Centers: Program
Application Guidelines, Fiscal Year 2002,
released 6/02.

Through the JRSA, BJS offers technical
assistance to the State SAC's in the
development, collection, analysis, use, 
and dissemination of criminal justice 
statistics. JRSA, formerly the Criminal 
Justice Statistics Association, was organized 
in 1974 by the directors of the State SAC's.  
It was formed to promote cooperation among
States and the exchange of information,
statistics, and technology.  

In providing technical services and liaison 
to the SAC's for BJS, JRSA maintains a
criminal justice information clearinghouse;
provides online access to the Database of
State Activities and Research and the
Firearms Research Information System
(FARIS); and holds an annual conference
on justice statistics, research, and 
policy analysis. 

Criminal records systems 
improvement and policy 

BJS supports several programs aimed at
improving criminal records. Criminal 
history records are fingerprint cards or 
their electronic counterparts, linked with
information about arrests, convictions, 
and sentences when available.  Records are
inaccessible electronically to other States 
if they are not automated or if a State 
does not participate in the national system
referred to as the Interstate Identification
Index.  

Records without dispositions delay inquiries
and handicap law enforcement.  The records 
are used in identifying individuals with a 
prior conviction and those who are
prohibited from purchasing a firearm, are
subject to domestic violence protection
orders,  or are ineligible to hold positions 
of responsibility involving children, the 
elderly, or the disabled.  Records are also 
used to support background checks on persons
employed or licensed for sensitive positions
such as at airports, government facilities,
and law enforcement agencies.

National Criminal History Improvement
Program (NCHIP), since 1995, has helped
States join with the FBI to build an 
accurate and useful national system of 
criminal records for improved identification 
of the criminal background of individuals. 
Interstate availability of complete
computerized criminal records is
increasingly vital for criminal 
investigations, prosecutorial charging, 
sentencing decisions, correctional 
supervision and release, community 
notification, and back-ground checks for 
those applying for licenses, firearm 
purchases, and work involving the safety 
and well-being of children, the elderly, 
and the disabled. NCHIP is an umbrella program 
that assists States in addressing the 
expanding range of technology-based criminal 
justice information, identification, and
communications needs.

NCHIP is funded under the Crime
Identification Technology Act of 1998
(CITA).  All States have received funds
under NCHIP totaling over $354 million from
1995 through 2001.  The BJS website
provides information on State NCHIP
awards and activities at
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/ nchip.htm#F&A>. 

Program priorities for 2002 include the
following:

*  Establishing the infrastructure to support
full implementation of the National Instant
Criminal Back-ground Check System (NICS), 
including full participation in the
Interstate Identification Index (III)

*  Supporting efforts to develop court
record systems

*  Supporting efforts relating to improvement
of National security standards and improving
records to avert terrorism

*  Encouraging States to focus on
upgrading the quality of State and local
protection order systems, ensuring that
such systems are capable of supplying
data on a real time basis to the FBI's
Protection Order File, and ensuring that
States have the capacity to initiate or
enhance efforts to collect and flag
misdemeanor records that involve domestic 
violence

*  Supporting State efforts to enhance
access to criminal records for noncriminal
justice purposes, including implementation
of the Interstate Crime Prevention and
Privacy Compact. 
 
For further details, refer to the National
Criminal History Improvement Program:
Fiscal Year 2002 Program Announcement,
released 2/02 (NCJ 192811).

Criminal Records Policy Program supports 
surveys, studies, conferences, and
technical assistance on issues relating to
criminal justice records.  Primary emphasis
is on accuracy and completeness of
records, limitations on dissemination,
commingling of juvenile and adult records,
data auditing techniques, and the interstate
exchange of records. Under this program,
the 50-State Survey of Criminal History
Information Systems is conducted, providing
information on the technology, policy, and
legislative status of criminal history 
records.

(NCJ 186766)
 
Firearm Inquiry Statistics Project (FIST) 
is designed to collect annual data describing
the number of inquiries made in connection
with presale firearm checks and the number
and basis for rejection of such applicants. 

Data collection procedures are adjusted to
reflect the differing presale check
procedures under the permanent system
(which became effective on 11/30/98) and
the interim period (02/28/94 - 11/29/98).  
As the permanent system requires a check 
on all firearms (including handguns),
subsequent annual releases include data on
both long guns and handguns. 

Findings describing background checks for
firearm transfers conducted in 2000 were
published in Background Checks for
Firearms Transfers, 2000, released 6/01
(NCJ 187985).  The annual report
presenting 2001 data is expected in summer
2002.
  
National Technical Assistance and Evaluation 
Program, directly assists States to implement 
programs, policies, and technologies to 
upgrade criminal records and improve 
interface with the FBI’s national
systems.  TA is provided through onsite
visits, web training, telephone, training
classes, and workshops and conferences. 
Since its inception, the technical 
assistance program has been managed by 
SEARCH, The National Consortium for Justice
Information and Statistics, under a grant
from BJS. 

Onsite TA visits are coordinated with the 
FBI to facilitate participation in FBI 
programs such as the Interstate Identification 
Index (III).  To date, almost all States have
received some assistance under this
component of NCHIP, and over 30 onsite
visits have been made. Requests for
assistance must be originated by the NCHIP
grantee agency, although the assistance
may be provided to any agency designated
by the grant recipient.

Justice Information Policy Assistance 
Technological development has raised new
questions about privacy policy relevant to
criminal record systems. To meet these
needs, BJS has for over 20 years supported
a privacy program under an award to
SEARCH.  The goal of the NCHIP privacy
program is to identify and analyze the
privacy impact of changes in the systems
environment, to provide a forum for the
discussion of these issues, and to develop
standards which may be applicable to the
collection, maintenance, and dissemination
of criminal record data.

National Conferences and Workshops 
are supported under NCHIP to convene
meetings and training sessions on regional
and national issues of concern.  The goals
of these conferences and workshops are to
provide information to practitioners and
policymakers, to permit exchange of
information among representatives of
various agencies across the 50 States, to
respond to the needs of grantees receiving
NCHIP funds, and to coordinate with other
units of State and Federal Government that
are involved in record improvement activities
and the operation of the national record
systems.  Recently emphasis has shifted to
include anti-terrorism and homeland security
issues related to the use of criminal history
records. 

Continuing National Evaluation  efforts
are supported by BJS on activities being
undertaken by States with NCHIP funds, as
well as with funds received from other
Federal and State sources.  The evaluation
program is supported under a grant to
Structured Decisions Corporation (SDC).
National Incident-Based Reporting System 
(NIBRS)

The FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR)
program, which began in 1929, collects
information about crimes reported to the
police.  In 1982 BJS and the FBI sponsored
a study of the UCR Program with the
objective of revising it to meet law
enforcement needs into the 21st century. A
5-year redesign effort to provide more com-
prehensive and detailed crime statistics
resulted in the National Incident-Based
Reporting System (NIBRS), which collects
data on each reported crime incident.  The
UCR Program is currently being converted
to NIBRS.
 
Under NIBRS, law enforcement authorities
will provide information to the FBI on each
criminal incident in 22 broad categories of
offenses that occur in their jurisdiction. 
NIBRS includes details about each incident,
including information about multiple victims
and offenders.  The requirements for
compatibility with NIBRS and the relaxed
standards for NIBRS compliance can be
found at the FBI website
<www.fbi.gov/publish/nibrs/nibrs.htm>.

BJS has participated in the design and
development of NIBRS and supports several
related efforts to encourage the use of
incident-based data.

NIBRS Implementation Program is designed 
to improve the quality of crime statistics 
in the United States. Under this program, 
BJS provided funding to 26 States in FY 
2001 to participate in the FBI's new
approach to uniform crime reporting. 

The BJS website provides information on
State awards and activities for the 
NIBRS Implementation Program
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/nibrs.htm>. 

NIBRS technical assistance and research
for systems implementation and data
analysis, is provided by SEARCH under 
a grant from BJS. Assistance includes 
onsite visits, web assistance, guidance 
via telephone and email, and training 
seminars. A website has been created and 
will be enhanced to include State and 
local profiles of NIBRS activity. Classes 
will be conducted to train practitioners 
on programs suitable for analysis of NIBRS 
data. The technical assistance program builds 
upon extensive previous efforts to review 
ongoing NIBRS activity and to identify 
impediments to NIBRS implementation and 
recommend solutions to these problems.

The Incident-Based Reporting Resource
Center, an online resource for
incident-based crime data, was established
by the Justice Research and Statistics
Association with BJS funding.  The Center
seeks to put practical analytical information
and tools into the hands of analysts who
want to work with incident-based data, and
to provide a forum where analysts can
exchange information and ideas about using
incident-based data.

BJS annually sponsors the American
Statistical Association (ASA) and BJS
Statistical Methodological Research
Program through the ASA Committee on
Law and Justice Statistics.  This program 
is designed to encourage the creative and
appropriate use of criminal justice data 
to inform substance and methodological
issues. Funding was provided for
researching topics pertaining to NIBRS.

Under BJS sponsorship, the Police Executive 
Research Forum (PERF)is conducting a project 
to stimulate NIBRS participation by law 
enforcement agencies. PERF interviewed key 
information systems/data management personnel 
and personnel from a variety of other units 
within law enforcement agencies, gathering
detailed information on departmental
information systems and the varying levels
of departmental effort to switch to an IBR
system compatible with the FBI's
requirements.

National Archive of Criminal Justice
Data, on behalf of BJS, archives data files,
documents them, and makes them available
to researchers, scholars, journalists, and
other users. Established in 1978, NACJD
headquarters are located with the central
staff of the Inter-university Consortium for
Political and Social Research (ICPSR) in the
Institute for Social Research at the
University of Michigan. 

The central mission of NACJD is to facilitate
and encourage research in the field of
criminal justice through the sharing of data
resources.
 
Specific goals include --

*  Providing machine-readable data for the
quantitative study of crime and the criminal
justice system through the development of
a central data archive.

*  Supplying technical assistance in
analyzing data collections and selecting
the computer hardware and software for
analyzing data efficiently and effectively. 
 
*  Offering training in quantitative methods 
of social science research to facilitate
secondary analysis of criminal justice data. 

NACJD routinely receives data from four
agencies within the U.S. Department of
Justice:  BJS, the National Institute of
Justice, the Office of Juvenile Justice and
Delinquency Prevention, and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. Individual scholars
and researchers in the criminal justice field
may also deposit data with NACJD, and
interested individuals should contact NACJD
staff for more information on this process.
