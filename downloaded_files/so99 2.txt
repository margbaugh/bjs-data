Highlights

Personnel

*  As of June 1999, the nearly 3,100 sheriffs'
offices operating nationwide had an
estimated 290,707 full-time employees,
including about 186,000 sworn personnel.   

*  From 1997 to 1999, the number of full-
time sheriffs' employees increased by about
27,000, or 10.4%.   When only sworn
personnel are considered, employment
increased by about 11,000, or 6.4%.

* Forty-eight sheriffs' offices had 500 or 
more full-time sworn personnel, and these
agencies employed nearly a third of all
sheriffs' deputies.  The largest, the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department, had
8,107 full-time officers.

* About half of all sworn personnel were
assigned to law enforcement field operations. 
Overall, approximately 66,000 deputies had
regularly assigned duties that included
responding to calls for service.

* About a third of all sworn personnel 
worked in jail-related positions, and about 
1 in 10 performed court-related duties such 
as providing court security or serving civil
process.

Operations

* Nearly all sheriffs' offices provided basic
law enforcement services such as routine
patrol (97%), responding to citizen calls for
service (95%) and investigating crimes
(92%).
 
*  In 1999, 88% of sheriffs' offices, employing
90% of sworn personnel, participated in a
9-1-1 emergency telephone system.  About
two-thirds of agencies had enhanced 9-1-1 in
1999 compared to about half in 1997.

*  From 1997 to 1999, the percent of sheriffs'
offices using routine foot patrol increased
from 16% to 21%; the percent using routine
bicycle patrol, from 6% to 9%; and the
percent using either type, from 20% to 26%.

*  Most sheriffs' offices had duties related 
to traffic law enforcement (81%), accident
investigations (72%), and traffic direction 
and control (58%).

*  Nearly all sheriffs' offices had responsibility
for court-related functions such as executing
arrest warrants (98%), serving civil process
(98%), and providing court security (94%). 
About four-fifths operated at least 1 jail.

*  Fifty-six percent of sheriffs' offices 
were responsible for search and rescue
operations, while 38% performed tactical
(SWAT) operations. 

Community policing

* Sixty-two percent of sheriffs' offices had
some type of community policing plan in
effect during 1999.  About a third of those
serving 250,000 or more residents had a
formal, written plan. 
 
*  About 2 in 3 sheriffs' deputies were
employed by an agency that trained at least
some new recruits in community policing
skills such as problem-solving and building
community partnerships.  Nearly two-thirds 
of sheriffs' offices serving 25,000 or more 
residents offered such training.

*  Sixty percent of sheriffs' offices had
full-time sworn personnel designated as
community policing officers.  Nationwide,
about 15,000 sheriffs' deputies were
regularly engaged in community policing
activities.

* Nearly two-fifths (38%) of sheriffs' 
offices had full-time sworn personnel 
serving as school resource officers, with 
a total of more than 3,400 so assigned 
overall.

* An estimated 86% of sheriffs' offices met
regularly with community groups. More than
40% of those serving 100,000 or more 
residents formed problem-solving
partnerships through written agreements,
and a similar percentage provided
community policing training to citizens. 

Computers and information systems

* Nearly all (95%) sheriffs' offices used
computers for administrative purposes during
1999.  Just 1% of all sheriffs' deputies
worked for an agency not using computers.

* In 1999, 52% of sheriffs' dispatch systems
were computer-aided, including more than
80% of those in agencies serving 100,000 or
more residents.  In 1990, 30% of sheriffs'
dispatch systems were computerized.  

* From 1990 to 1999, the percent of officers
employed by a department with computerized 
arrest records increased from 70% to 91%.  
Increases were also observed for criminal 
histories (67% to 81%), warrants (75% to 
91%), and summonses (48% to 60%).

* More than a third of sheriffs' offices 
used computers for crime analysis (39%) and
crime mapping (36%) during 1999.  This
included a majority of agencies serving a
population of 50,000 or more.

* From 1990 to 1999, the percent of sworn
personnel working for a sheriff's office 
using in-field computers or terminals increased
from 28% to 58%.  Sheriffs' offices had about
15 in-field computers or terminals per 100
officers as of June 1999.
  
* About a third of sworn personnel worked for
a sheriff's office where at least some officers
in the field could use in-field computers to
access information on wanted suspects
(37%) or driving records (32%).  About a
fourth were in agencies where stolen
property (27%) or criminal history (24%)
records could be accessed.

Written policies and procedures

* Nearly all sworn personnel worked in a
sheriff's office with written policies or
procedures pertaining to conduct and appearance 
(98%), use of deadly force (98%), use of 
nonlethal force (95%), handling of citizen 
complaints (92%), and domestic disputes (90%).

The LEMAS survey

During 1999, the Bureau of Justice Statistics
(BJS), as a part of its Law Enforcement
Management and Administrative Statistics 
(LEMAS) program, surveyed a nationally 
representative sample of State and local 
law enforcement agencies operating nationwide.  
Previous LEMAS surveys were conducted in 
1987, 1990, 1993, and 1997.

This report presents 1999 LEMAS data
describing the personnel, operations,
community policing initiatives, computers 
and information systems, and written policies 
of the more than 3,000 sheriffs' offices
operating in the United States. 

Except for a small number of appointees,
sheriffs are elected officials.  To better 
reflect this status, this report uses the 
term "office," universally, a change from past 
reports in this series.

Sheriffs' offices typically serve counties and
independent cities.  Although sheriffs' 
offices may have countywide jail and court-
related responsibilities, their law enforcement
jurisdiction may exclude county areas served
by a local police department.  In some
counties municipalities contract with the
sheriff's office for law enforcement services. 
In counties and independent cities with a
separate police department, the sheriff's
office may not have any primary law
enforcement jurisdiction.  

The 1999 LEMAS survey was mailed to
3,319 State and local law enforcement
agencies, and 3,246 of them provided data
for a response rate of 97.8%.  (See
Methodology on page 20 for a description 
of sampling procedures.) 

This report and its companion report (Local
Police Departments, 1999, NCJ 186478,
May 2001), summarize data collected from
agencies of all sizes.  For agency-specific
tabulations, see the BJS report Law
Enforcement Management and Administrative 
Statistics, 1999:  Data for Individual State 
and Local Agencies with 100 or More Officers, 
NCJ 184481, November 2000). 

Personnel

As of June 30, 1999, sheriffs' offices had 
an estimated 290,707 full-time employees.  
About 186,000, or 64%, of these employees
were sworn officers.  This accounted for 27%
of all full-time sworn personnel working for
State and local general purpose law
enforcement agencies nationwide.  Sheriffs'
offices employed about 9,000 sworn officers
on a part-time basis.

The estimated 104,848 full-time nonsworn
personnel employed by sheriffs' offices 
in 1999 comprised about 41% of all such
employees working in general purpose law
enforcement agencies.  Sheriffs' offices 
had more than 10,000 part-time nonsworn
employees.

From 1990 to 1999, the number of full-time
sheriffs' employees increased by about
87,000, or 43% -- an average of 4.7%
annually.  The number of full-time sworn
officers increased by about 44,400, or 31%,
during this time.
 
There were about 27,000 more full-time
sheriffs' office employees in 1999 than in
1997, an increase of 10.4%.  Among sworn 
personnel, employment increased by about 
11,000, or 6.4%, from 1997 to 1999.  

From 1990 to 1999, the number of full-time
civilian employees in sheriffs' offices rose
from 62,556 to 104,848, an increase of
67.6%.  This included an increase of about
16,000, or 18.1%, from 1997 to 1999.

Nationwide, 408, or 13.2% of sheriffs' 
offices, employed at least 100 sworn 
personnel. This included 17 agencies with 
1,000 or more officers.  An estimated 815, 
or 26.4% of all agencies, employed fewer 
than 10 sworn personnel.

About a fifth of all full-time sheriffs' 
deputies were employed by a agency  with 
1,000 or more officers, and about two-thirds 
worked for one with at least 100 officers. 
Agencies with fewer than 10 sworn personnel
accounted for about 2% of all officers.
 
Although less than a sixth of sheriffs' 
offices served 100,000 or more residents, 
such agencies employed about two-thirds of 
all sworn personnel.  About a fifth of 
deputies were employed in jurisdictions with 
1 million or more residents. 

The average size of sheriffs' offices ranged
from about 2,000 full-time employees in the
largest jurisdictions to 11 in the smallest.  
By sworn personnel, the average size ranged
from 1,300 in the largest jurisdictions to 
6 in the smallest.  

More than a third (36%) of the full-time sworn
personnel in sheriffs' offices had regularly
assigned duties that included responding to
calls for service.  By population category, 
the proportion of officers responding to calls
ranged from less than 1 in 4 in agencies
serving 1 million or more residents, to nearly
3 in 4 in those serving fewer than 10,000
residents.  

About half of sworn personnel worked in law
enforcement field operations (49%).  Officers
working in the field operations area, but not
assigned to respond to calls, often performed
supervisory or investigative duties.  

The next highest area of employment for
sworn personnel was in jail-related positions
(31.2%).  Another 10% had court-related
duties such as serving process or providing
court security.
 
About 6% of sworn personnel primarily
performed administrative duties, and 4%
worked in technical support positions
primarily related to communications, fleet
management, crime prevention, or training. 

Among nonsworn employees, the largest
percentage performed jail-related duties
(56.5%), followed by technical support
(28.4%).  Other areas of duty for civilian
employees included administration (6.9%),
field operations (3.9%), and court 
operations (2.8%).

As of June 30, 1999, sheriffs' offices
collectively employed about 98% of the
maximum number of sworn personnel
authorized by their budgets, and 96% of 
their authorized civilian employee strength. 
Actual-to-authorized ratios for sworn
personnel were highest in jurisdictions with
fewer than 10,000  residents, and lowest in
those with  1 million or more residents. For
nonsworn employees, agencies serving fewer 
than 10,000 residents had the highest ratio, 
and those serving 500,000 to 999,999
residents, the lowest.

Some sheriffs' offices partly offset officer
shortages through the use of supplemental
personnel such as sworn reserve or auxiliary
officers.  As of June 30, 1999, 54% of
agencies were using reserve or auxiliary
sworn officers, with an average of 5 full-time
and 14 part-time officers each.  

Some agencies utilized nonsworn volunteers
such as community service officers or police
service aides.  As of June 30, 1999, 8% were
using community service officers or police
service aides, with an average of 7 full-time
and 17 part-time each.  About a sixth of
agencies used other types of nonsworn
volunteers, with an average of 68 part-time
volunteers each.

Nationwide, sheriffs' offices had an estimated
8,847 full-time reserve officers and 22,654
part-time reserve officers (not shown in
table).  They also had about 5,800
community service officers and police
service aides with about 30% of these
working full-time.  Agencies utilized an
additional 36,000 nonsworn volunteers, with
nearly all working part-time.  

Operations

Stations and substations

As of June 30, 1999, sheriffs' offices
operated an estimated 1,639 district or
precinct stations and 1,915 neighborhood 
or community substations that were separate
from headquarters.  More than two-thirds of 
the agencies serving 1 million or more 
residents had district or precinct stations, 
as did about half of those serving 100,000 
to 999,999 residents.  About a half of the 
sheriffs' offices serving a population of 
100,000 or more operated community substations.  

Among agencies operating such facilities, 
the average number of district or precinct
stations ranged from 8 in jurisdictions with 
1 million or more residents to 1 in those with
fewer than 25,000 residents.  For substations, 
the average number operated ranged from 8 in 
jurisdictions with 1 million or more residents 
to 2 in those with fewer than 25,000 residents.

Patrol and response

Nearly all (97%) sheriffs' offices used 
automobiles for routine patrol during 1999. 
By population category, the percent with
routine auto patrol ranged from 99% of those
serving fewer than 50,000 residents to about
80% of those serving a population of 500,000 
or more.    

About a fifth of agencies used foot (21%) or
marine (19%) patrol units on a routine basis,
including more than a third of those serving
a population of 1 million or more.  Agencies
with routine foot patrol employed 30% of all
sworn personnel, and those with routine
marine patrol, 44%. 

Smaller percentages of agencies used bicycle 
(9%), motorcycle (6%), or horse (3%) patrol 
on a routine basis.  Nearly half of the
agencies serving 250,000 or more residents
used routine bicycle patrol, and about half 
of those serving a population of 1 million 
or more used motorcycle units on a routine
basis.

Agencies using routine bicycle patrol
employed 32% of all sworn personnel, those
with motorcycle patrol, 35%, and those with
horse patrol, 10%.

From 1997 to 1999, the percent of sheriffs'
offices using foot or bicycle patrol on a
routine basis increased in all population
categories.  In jurisdictions with 500,000 
or more residents, the increase was from 41%
to 55%; in those with 100,000 to 499,999
residents; from 22% to 34%; in those with
25,000 to 99,999 residents, from 18% to
24%; and in those with fewer than 25,000
residents, from 19% to 23%.

Thirty-eight percent of agencies used foot
patrol for special events only.  Horse (14%)
and marine (9%) units were the next most
likely to be used exclusively during special
events, followed by bicycle (6%), motorcycle
(4%), and automobile (1%)  units. 

Dispatch

More than two-thirds (70%) of sheriffs'
offices had primary responsibility for
dispatching citizen calls for service. These
agencies employed 71% of all sworn
personnel.  A majority of the agencies in
each population category performed dispatch
services, including about three-fourths of
those serving fewer than 25,000 residents.

9-1-1 emergency telephone system

In 1999, 88% of sheriffs' offices, employing
90% of all sworn personnel, participated in
an emergency telephone system whereby
one of their units could be dispatched as a
result of a call to 9-1-1 or its equivalent. 
More than 90% of the agencies serving a
population of 25,000 to 249,999 residents
more were 9-1-1 participants.

Three-fourths of sheriffs' office 9-1-1
systems were enhanced, capable of
pinpointing the location of a caller
automatically.  More than 60% of the
agencies in each population category of
10,000 or more had enhanced 9-1-1.

From 1990 to 1999 the percentage of 
sheriffs' offices with 9-1-1 more than
doubled, from 42% to 88%.  During this time,
the percentage of agencies with enhanced
9-1-1 system increased from 11% to 65%. 
From 1997 to 1999 alone, the proportion of
sheriffs' offices with enhanced 9-1-1
increased from about half to about
two-thirds.

In 1999, 79% of sheriffs' deputies were
employed by an agency with enhanced 9-1-1
compared to 36% in 1990.

Crime investigation

Overall, 92% of sheriffs' offices conducted
investigations of at least some types of
crimes.  Eighty-nine percent had
investigative responsibility for violent 
crimes such as rape, robbery, or assault.  
This included more than 90% of those serving 
a population of 10,000 to 99,999.  Eighty-six
percent of agencies handled homicide
investigations, including about 9 in 10
agencies serving 10,000 to 99,999 residents.

Ninety percent of sheriffs' offices were
responsible for investigating property crimes
such as burglary, larceny, or motor vehicle
theft.  More than 90% of agencies serving
10,000 to 99,999 residents handled such
investigations. 

Seventy-two percent of all agencies were
responsible for arson investigations, with
those serving 25,000 to 99,999 residents
(78%) the most likely to handle such crimes. 

Forty percent of agencies were responsible
for investigating environmental crimes.  No
more than 44% of the agencies in any
population category handled such
investigations.

Forty-two percent of agencies had primary
responsibility for computer-related crime
investigations.  This included a majority of
those serving a population of 50,000 or
more.

Investigative support functions

About 3 in 8 sheriffs' offices were responsible
for fingerprint processing.  This included
more than half of the agencies serving a
population of 100,000 or more.

About 1 in 10 agencies provided crime lab
services, ranging from 38% of those serving
1 million or more residents, to about 5% of
those serving fewer than 50,000 residents.
   
Just 4% of sheriffs' offices had ballistics
testing responsibilities, although nearly a
third of those serving a population of 1 million
or more did. 

Court-related functions

Nearly all sheriffs' offices had responsibility
for executing arrest warrants (98%), serving
civil process (94%), and providing court
security (93%).  Agencies serving a
population of 1 million or more were
somewhat less likely to handle these duties
than agencies in other jurisdictions.

Sheriffs' offices responsible for executing
arrest warrants employed 94% of all sworn
personnel, those serving civil process, 93%,
and those providing court security, 92%.

Detention facilities

An estimated 78% of sheriffs' offices,
employing 88% of all sworn personnel,
operated at least one jail during 1999.  
At least 64%  of the agencies in each 
population category operated a jail, 
including 85% of those serving a population 
of 25,000 to 99,999.   

As of June 1999, there were approximately
606,000 inmates in local jails.  Most of 
these inmates were in jails operated by 
sheriffs, and sheriffs' offices had an 
estimated 112,000 full-time employees assigned 
to jail-related duties.  About half of these
employees were sworn personnel and half
civilian employees.

Nineteen percent of sheriffs' offices,
employing 34% of all sworn personnel,
operated a temporary holding (lockup) 
facility for overnight detention that was 
separate from a jail.  The percentage of 
agencies with a temporary lockup was 
highest in jurisdictions with a population 
of 1 million or more (47%).

Agencies in the largest jurisdictions were
also the most likely (64%) to have temporary
holding cells not used for overnight detention.  
Less than half of the agencies in each of the 
other population categories had them.  Overall, 
31% of agencies, employing 49% of all officers, 
had this type of holding cell.

Traffic and vehicle-related functions

About 8 in 10 sheriffs' offices were
responsible for enforcing traffic laws, 
7 in 10 for investigating traffic 
accidents, and 6 in 10 for traffic 
direction and control.  Agencies serving 
fewer than 250,000 residents were the 
most likely to have traffic and vehicle-
related enforcement duties.  About a 
third of sheriffs' offices had parking
enforcement duties, including about half 
of those serving a population of 1 million 
or more. A fifth of agencies had responsibilities
related to school crossing services, and a
similar proportion handled commercial
vehicle enforcement.   

Special operations functions

Just over half (56%) of sheriffs' offices, 
employing about two-thirds (66%) of all
sworn personnel, had responsibility for
search and rescue operations.  At least 47%
of the agencies in each population category
handled this function.

Thirty-eight percent of sheriffs' offices
performed tactical operations, commonly
associated with SWAT (Special Weapons
and Tactics) teams.  These agencies
employed 67% of all sheriffs' officers.  A
majority of the agencies in each population
category of agencies serving 50,000 or more
residents, and half of those serving 25,000 
to 49,999, were responsible for tactical
operations.

An estimated 28% of all agencies, employing
50% of all sworn personnel, were responsible
for underwater recovery operations.  This
included nearly half of the agencies serving
100,000 or more residents.   

Bomb disposal was handled by 8% of sheriffs' 
offices, employing 36% of all sworn
personnel.  More than 1/3 of the agencies
serving 250,000 or more residents handled
this function compared to less than 1/10 of
those serving fewer than 100,000 residents.

Special public safety functions

About a third of sheriffs' offices were
responsible for animal control services.  This
included nearly half of those serving fewer
than 10,000 residents.  Agencies handling
animal control employed 20% of all sworn
personnel.

Other special public safety functions handled
by sheriffs' offices included civil defense
(23%), emergency medical services (13%),
and fire services (10%).  Agencies
performing civil defense functions employed
15% of all officers, those handling
emergency medical services, 11%, and
those providing fire services, 4%.
 
Community policing

Community policing is a philosophy that
promotes and supports organizational
strategies to address the causes of crime
and to reduce the fear of crime and social
disorder.  These strategies use
problem-solving techniques and community
partnerships.  A fundamental shift from
traditional reactive policing, community
policing stresses the prevention of crime. 
Community policing supports and empowers
front-line officers, decentralizes command,
and encourages innovative problem solving. 
(See Community Policing in Local Police
Departments, 1997 and 1999, BJS Special
Report, February 2001, NCJ 184794.)

In 1999, 12% of sheriffs' offices, employing
33% of all sworn personnel,  had a formal,
written community policing plan.  The percentage 
of agencies with a formal, written plan was 
highest among those serving 250,000 or more 
residents.  Just 5% of the sheriffs' 
offices serving fewer than 10,000
residents, typically the most rural
jurisdictions, had a formal, written 
community policing plan.  

In jurisdictions with 500,000 residents or
more, about as many sheriffs' offices had a
formal, written plan as had no plan at all.  
In all population categories, a majority of
sheriffs' offices had either a formal, 
written community policing plan or an
informal, unwritten plan.  Overall, 75% of 
all sworn personnel worked for an agency  
with some type of community policing plan.

Community policing training

During the 2-year period ending June 30,
1999, 54% of sheriffs' offices, employing
68% of all sworn personnel, trained at least
some of their new officer recruits in
community policing skills such as
problem-solving and developing community 
partnerships. 

Thirty-six percent of agencies, employing
51% of all sworn personnel, trained all new
recruits in community policing.  More than
half of the sheriffs' offices serving 250,000 
or more residents trained all recruits, 
compared to about a fourth  of those serving 
a population of less than 10,000.

Sixty-one percent of agencies, employing
72% of all sworn personnel, trained at least
some in-service officers during the 2-year
period.  Eighteen percent of agencies,
employing 19% of all sworn personnel,
trained all in-service officers in community
policing. 

Community policing personnel

Overall, 60% of sheriffs' offices, employing
73% of all sworn personnel, had full-time
deputies serving as community policing
officers, community resource officers,
community relations officers, or otherwise
regularly engaged in community policing
activities.  As of June 30, 1999, an estimated
15,443, or 8%, of all sworn personnel served
in this capacity.

The proportion of sheriffs' offices with
full-time community policing officers ranged
from nearly three-fourths of those serving
500,000 or more residents, to just over half
of those serving a population of less than
10,000.  Among agencies using them, the
average number of community policing officers 
ranged from 137 in jurisdictions with 1 million 
or more residents, to 4 in those with a 
population of less than 25,000.

In jurisdictions with fewer than 10,000
residents, 30% of full-time sworn personnel
were designated as community policing
officers, twice as many as in the next highest
category.  Less than 10% of the officers in
each population category of 50,000 or more
were so designated. 

Thirty-eight percent of sheriffs' offices,
employing 60% of all sworn personnel, had
full-time school resource officers during
1999.   A majority of the agencies serving
100,000 or more residents had school
resource officers, as did about two-fifths 
of those serving a population of 10,000 to
99,999. 

These officers use a community policing
approach to provide a safe environment for
students and staff.  In addition to handling
calls for service within the school, they 
work closely with school administrators and 
staff to prevent crime and disorder by 
monitoring crime trends, problem areas, 
cultural conflicts, and other areas of
concern. 

As of June 30, 1999, sheriffs' offices had 
an estimated 3,447 full-time sworn personnel
assigned as school resource officers. 
Among agencies using them, the average
number of school resource officers ranged
from 9 in agencies serving a population 
of 1 million or more, to 2 in those serving 
fewer than 50,000 residents. 

Community-oriented policies 
and programs

Fifty-six percent of sheriffs' offices,
employing 73% of all sworn personnel, gave
patrol officers responsibility for specific
geographic areas or beats during 1999. This
included about two-thirds of the agencies
serving a population of 25,000 or more. 
 
Seventeen percent of agencies, employing
48% of all sworn personnel, assigned cases
to investigators by geographic area.  This
included about half of those serving a
population of 1 million or more, and about
two-fifths of those serving a population of
250,000 to 999,999.

Twenty-two percent of sheriffs' offices,
employing 41% of all sworn personnel,
actively encouraged patrol officers to
become involved in problem-solving projects. 
More than two-fifths of the agencies serving
a population of 250,000 or more had such a
policy.
 
Fifteen percent of agencies, employing 27%
of all sworn personnel, included problem-
solving projects in the performance
evaluation criteria for patrol officers.  
This included about a fourth of the agencies
serving a population of 250,000 or more.  

During the 2-year period ending June 30,
1999, 25% of sheriffs' offices, employing
45% of all sworn personnel, formed
partnerships with community groups, local
agencies, or others through written
agreements.  This included about half of the
agencies serving a population of 1 million or
more, and about two-fifths of those  serving
100,000 to 999,999 residents.  

Twenty-six percent of agencies, employing
48% of all sworn personnel, offered training
to citizens on community policing topics such
as community mobilization and problem-solving.  
About half of those serving 1 million or 
more residents offered such training, as 
did more than two-fifths of those serving 
100,000 or 999,999 residents.  

Eighty-six percent of agencies, employing
94% of all officers, regularly met with
community groups during the 2-year period
ending June 30, 1999.  The percent of
agencies holding regular meetings ranged
from 77% of those serving fewer than 10,000 
residents to 93% of those serving 50,000 to 
99,999 residents.
   
An estimated 84% of sworn personnel worked 
for a sheriffs' office that regularly met
with school groups and 75% for one that met
with neighborhood associations.  The 
percentages for other types of groups
were:  senior citizen (67%), domestic
violence (66%), business (63%), youth
service (53%), religious (51%), and tenant
(39%). 

Citizen surveys

Twenty-two percent of sheriffs' offices,
employing 39% of all sworn personnel,
surveyed citizens in their jurisdiction 
during the year ending June 30, 1999.  This
included about two-fifths of the agencies
serving a population of 250,000 or more.

Eighteen percent of agencies, employing
35% of sworn personnel, surveyed citizens'
about their satisfaction with the services
provided by the sheriffs' office.  Fifteen
percent of agencies, employing 29% of all
sworn personnel, surveyed citizens regarding 
their perception of crime problems.  Seven 
percent of agencies, employing 15% of sworn 
personnel, surveyed citizens about their 
personal crime experiences.

A majority of the agencies conducting
surveys used the data to provide information
to patrol officers (72%), evaluate program
effectiveness (59%), or prioritize crime-
related problems (57%).   About half used 
the information for allocating resources
to targeted areas (50%), training officers
(48%), or formulating policy and procedures
(44%). A fifth used it to redistrict beats or
reporting areas.

Citizen access to crime statistics

Seventy-five percent of sheriffs' offices,
employing 84% of all sworn personnel,
provided citizens with routine access to
crime statistics or crime maps.  This included
more than 80% of the agencies serving a
population of 25,000 to 249,999.

Agencies were most likely to provide access
to statistics at the county or city level 
(69% of agencies employing 77% of all 
officers).  An estimated 15% of agencies, 
employing 27% of all sworn personnel, 
provided access to statistics by neighborhood.  
Smaller percentages made crime statistics 
available at the level of patrol beat (9%), 
district or precinct (9%), or street or block 
(7%).  

Eighty-six percent of the sheriffs' offices 
that provided citizens with routine access 
to crime statistics or crime maps made them
available to those who inquired in person.  
A majority also provided statistics in response
to requests made by telephone (60%) or in
writing (57%). 

More than two-fifths of agencies routinely
published crime statistics in newspapers
(49%) or agency reports (41%).  Other
methods of access included radio (24%), fax
(20%), television (16%), the Internet (9%),
and newsletter (8%).

Computers and information systems
 
Administrative functions

Nearly all sheriffs' offices used computers 
for administrative purposes during 1999. 
Just 1% of sworn personnel were employed by 
an agency not using computers.  

An estimated 87% of agencies, employing
97% of all sworn personnel, used personal
computers (PC's) in 1999.  This was an
increase over 1997 when 76% of agencies,
employing 93% of officers, used them.  In
1999 at least 94% of the agencies in each
population category of 25,000 or more used
PC's. 

Forty-one percent of agencies, employing
55% of all sworn personnel, used mainframe
computers during 1999.  This included a
majority of agencies serving a population 
of 50,000 or more. In 1997, 59% of sheriffs'
offices, employing 81% of all sworn personnel, 
were using mainframes.
  
Sheriffs' offices stored various types of
administrative records in computer files
during 1999.  Just over half had 
computerized personnel (54%) and inventory 
(53%) records.  More than 4 in 5 agencies 
serving a population of 250,000 million or more 
had computerized personnel files, and 
about 4 in 5 agencies serving 500,000 or 
more residents had computerized inventory
records.  Agencies with computerized
personnel records employed 82% of all
sworn personnel, and those with
computerized inventory records, 77%.

Thirty-eight percent of sheriffs' offices,
employing 74% of all sworn personnel, had
computerized payroll records.  This included
a majority of agencies serving 50,000 or
more residents and about four-fifths of those

Computer-aided dispatch

Among the estimated 2,146 sheriffs' offices
with responsibility for dispatching calls 
for service during 1999, about 52% used
computer-aided dispatch systems.  This
included about 9 in 10 agencies serving a
population of 500,000 or more, about 8 in 10
agencies serving a population of 100,000 to
499,999, and about 6 in 10 serving 25,000 to
99,999 residents.

The percentage of sheriffs' office dispatch
systems that were computerized increased
significantly from 1990 to 1999.  For
example, among those  agencies that
performed dispatch functions and served
500,000 or more residents, the percent with
computer-aided dispatch rose from 51% to
89%.

Among agencies serving 100,000 to 499,999
residents, the percentage with computerized
dispatch increased from 40% in 1990 to 79%
in 1999; among those serving 25,000 to
99,999 residents, from 23% to 61%; and in

of 100,000 or more had computerized criminal 
history files.  About two-thirds of those 
serving 50,000 to 249,999 residents had 
computerized summons information.

From 1990 to 1999 the percentage of
sheriffs' offices with computerized
information on arrests, criminal histories,
warrants, and summonses increased
substantially.  Accordingly, the percentage 
of sworn personnel employed by an agency
storing these types of records in a
computerized format also increased.

The percentage of officers employed by an
agency with computerized arrest records
increased from 70% in 1990 to 91% in 1999. 
Similar increases in the use computerized
files were observed for information pertaining
to warrants (from 75% in 1990 to 91% in
1999), criminal histories (from 67% to 81%),
and summonses (from 48% to 60%).

agency that used them.

Nationwide, sheriffs' offices had 15 
in-field computers or terminals per 100 
officers as of June 30, 1999.  Those serving 
250,000 or more residents had the highest 
ratio, more than 20 per 100.  The next highest

agency with written policies or procedures 
on officer conduct and appearance (98%), 
use of deadly force (98%), use of nonlethal 
force (95%), handling of citizen complaints 
(92%), and handling of domestic disputes

Methodology

The Law Enforcement Management and
Administrative Statistics (LEMAS) survey
collects data from a nationally
representative sample of the approximately
19,000 publicly funded State and local law
enforcement agencies in the United States. 

This report presents data from the 1999
survey describing sheriffs' offices in 
terms of their personnel, operations, 
community policing initiatives, computers 
and information systems, and written 
policies and procedures.  

The 1999 LEMAS survey questionnaire was
mailed to 3,319 State and local law
enforcement agencies.  The initial mailing 
of the questionnaire was conducted in 
June 1999, and, unless otherwise indicated, 
June 30, 1999, was used as the reference 
date for survey questions.  

Allowing for the exclusion of certain types 
of special jurisdiction police, 895 law
enforcement agencies in the U.S.  with 100
or more sworn officers as of June 30, 1996,
were included in the sample as self-
representing (SR) agencies.  This included 
529 local police departments, 306 sheriffs' 
offices, the 49 primary State law enforcement 
agencies, and 11 special jurisdiction 
police agencies.

The self-representing (SR) agencies were
supplemented by a nationally representative
sample of agencies with fewer than 100
sworn officers.  These nonself-representing
(NSR) agencies were chosen using a
stratified random sample with cells based 
on the type of agency (local police, sheriff, 
or special police), size of population served,
and number of sworn officers.   The 2,424
NSR agencies selected included 1,556
local police departments, 694 sheriffs' agencies 
and offices, and 174 special jurisdiction 
police agencies.  

A total of 3,246 agencies responded to the
1999 LEMAS survey for a response rate of
97.8%.  This included 883 SR agencies and
2,363 NSR agencies.  The final database
includes 2,052 local police departments, 967 
sheriffs' offices, 178 special jurisdiction 
police agencies, and the 49 primary State 
police agencies.

The base weight for all SR agencies is 1. 
For NSR sheriffs' offices, the base weights.

The final weight associated with every
agency, both SR and NSR, is the product of
the base weight, a factor that adjusted for
changes in the universe since 1996, and a
factor that adjusted for any nonresponding
agencies in each cell. 

Some responding agencies did not fully
complete the LEMAS questionnaire.  When
an agency did not supply a response to an
item, median value imputation or ratio
imputation was used.  Median value
imputation uses the median value of an 
item reported by agencies in the same sample
cell.  Ratio imputation uses the median value
of a ratio reported by agencies in the same
sample cell. 

Median value imputation was used to impute
counts of facilities, reserve sworn officers,
community service officers, and nonsworn
volunteers.  Ratio imputation was used to
impute counts of employees and computer
equipment.  Every imputed item on the
database has an indicator that the value has
been imputed.  Complete documentation
regarding sampling procedures and
nonresponse adjustments is available upon
request. 

Because the data from agencies with fewer
than 100 sworn personnel were collected
from a sample, the results are subject to
sampling error.  Statements of comparison in
this report have been tested to ensure that
observed differences between values are
significant at 2 standard errors (the
95%-confidence level) or higher.  The survey
data are also subject to response and
processing errors.
