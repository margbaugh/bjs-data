Highlights

*  During 2001, 10 States experienced
prison population decreases, led by New
Jersey (down 5.5%), followed by Utah
(-5.2%), New York (- 3.8%), and Texas
(-2.8%).  Other States had increases, led
by West Virginia (up 9.3%), Alaska (8.9%),
Idaho (8.5%), Oregon (8.3%), and Hawaii
(7.9%).

*  Between July 1, 2001, and December
31, 2001, the number of inmates under
State jurisdiction declined by 3,705
inmates (down 0.3%), repeating the same
pattern of decline first observed in the 
last 6 months of 2000. 

*  The Federal Bureau of Prisons continued 
to grow rapidly, up 4,205 inmates since 
midyear 2001. At yearend 2001, the Federal 
system was the third largest prison system, 
behind Texas (162,070) and California 
(159,444). If growth rates remain unchanged, 
the Federal system will be the largest by 
yearend 2002. 

*  At yearend 2001, privately operated
facilities housed 91,828 inmates (5.8% of
State and 12.3% of Federal inmates); local
jails housed 70,681State and Federal
inmates (5.0% of all prisoners). 

*  On December 31, 2001, State prisons
were operating between 1% and 16% above 
capacity, while Federal prisons were 
operating at 31% above capacity.

*  At yearend 2001, 93,031 women were in
State or Federal prisons -- 6.6% of all
prison inmates.  

*  Since 1995 the number of male prisoners 
has grown 24% (reaching 1,313,000 in 2001), 
while the number of female prisoners has 
increased 36%.

*  At yearend 2000, 49% of State prisoners
were serving time for violent offenses, 
up from 46% in 1990.

*  Violent offenders accounted for 55% 
of the increase among male inmates and
33% of the increase among female
inmates. 

*  Among the more than 1.3 million
sentenced inmates at yearend 2001, an
estimated 441,700 were black males
between the ages of 20 and 39. At
yearend 2001, 10.0% of black males age
25 to 29 were in prison, compared to 
2.9% of Hispanic males and 1.2% of white
males in the same age group.
-----------------------------------------------------

The total number of prisoners under the
jurisdiction of Federal or State  adult
correctional authorities was 1,406,031 at
yearend 2001.  During the year the States
added 3,193 prisoners, and the Federal
prison system added 11,577 prisoners. 
Overall, the Nation's prison population
grew 1.1%, which was less than the
average annual growth of 3.8% since
yearend 1995.  During 2001 the prison
population rose at the lowest rate since
1972 and had the smallest absolute
increase since 1979. 

The rate of incarceration in prison at
yearend 2001 was 470 sentenced inmates
per 100,000 U.S. residents -- up from 411
in 1995.  About 1 in every 112 men and 1
in every 1,724 women were sentenced
prisoners under the jurisdiction of State 
or Federal authorities.

Overall, the United States incarcerated
2,100,146 persons at yearend 2001. This
total represents persons held in --
--Federal and State prisons (1,324,465,
which excludes State and Federal
prisoners in local jails)
--territorial prisons (15,852)
--local jails (631,240)
--facilities operated by or exclusively for the 
  U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (8,761)
--military facilities (2,436) 
--jails in Indian country (1,912)
--juvenile facilities (108,965 as of
October 1999 

More than 1.96 million in prisons 
and local jails 

On December 31, 2001, 1,324,465 inmates 
were in the custody of State and Federal 
prison authorities, and 631,240 were in 
the custody of local jail authorities. 
Since yearend 2000 the total incarcerated
population has increased by 24,738. 
Including inmates in public and privately
operated facilities, the number of inmates
in State prisons increased 0.4% during
2001; the number in Federal prisons,
7.0%; and in local jails, 1.6%.  During
2001 the total  incarcerated population
grew 1.3% -- about a third of the annual
average (3.6%) since 1995. 

The rate of incarceration in prison and 
jail was 686 inmates per 100,000 residents 
in 2001, up from 601 in 1995.  At yearend
2001, 1 in every 146 U.S. residents were
incarcerated in State or Federal prison or 
a local  jail. 

U.S. prison population rose 1.1% 
during 2001 -- the smallest annual 
growth rate since 1972

The 2001 growth in the number of inmates
under State or Federal jurisdiction (1.1%)
was lower than the percentage increase
recorded during 2000 (1.3%) and the
lowest annual rate recorded since 1972. 
The population under the jurisdiction of
State and Federal authorities increased by
14,770 inmates during 2001, lower than
the increase in 2000 (up 18,191).  Since
December 31, 1995, the prison population
has grown an average of 41,919 inmates
per year.

Since 1995 the overall growth of the
Nation's prison population has steadily
slowed.  Annual growth rates dropped
from 6.7% in 1995 to 1.1% in 2001. In
absolute numbers, the annual increase in
prisoners under State or Federal
jurisdiction fell from 71,172 in 1995 to
14,770 in 2001.   

Twelve States reported increases 
of at least 5% during 2001; 
10 States reported decreases

Between January 1 and December 31,
West Virginia experienced the largest
increase (up 9.3%), followed by Alaska
(8.9%), Idaho (8.5%), and Oregon (8.3%). 
Ten States experienced a decline in prison
populations.  New Jersey had the largest
decline (down 5.5%), followed by Utah
(down 5.2%), New York (down 3.8%),
Texas (down 2.8%), and California (down
2.2%).  The District of Columbia (down
63.1%) transferred responsibility for
sentenced felons to the Federal Bureau of
Prisons.  (See page 4.)

In absolute numbers of inmates, 10
jurisdictions grew by at least 1,000
inmates.  The Federal system (up 11,577),
experienced the largest growth, followed
by Georgia (up 1,705), and Tennessee (up
1,505).  Four States had decreases of at
least 1,000 inmates.  Texas (down 4,649)
experienced the greatest decline, followed
by California (down 3,557), New York
(down 2,665), and New Jersey (down 1,642).

In the last 6 months of 2001, the 
State prison population declined  
about 3,700 inmates 

Between July 1, 2001, and December 31,
2001, the number of inmates under State
jurisdiction dropped 0.3% (from 1,252,743
at midyear to 1,249,038 at yearend). At
the same time the Federal population
continued to grow (up 2.8% from midyear
2001).  In the last 6 months of 2001, the
Federal population rose 4,205, compared
to an increase of 7,372 inmates in the first
6 months. 

---------------------------------------------
Since January 1, 1995, 6-month growth rates 
for all States combined have dropped sharply.  
In addition, growth rates in the first half 
of each year have been substantially larger 
than rates in the second half.  At the same 
time, Federal growth rates rose, reaching a 
peak of 6.0% in the first 6 months of 1999.  
Since then, growth in the first half of each 
year slowed (to 5.4% in 2000 and 5.1% in
2001). 

Federal  and State growth affected by
the transfer of sentenced felons from
the District of Columbia 

The transfer of responsibility for sentenced
felons from the District of Columbia to the
Federal system was completed by yearend
2001. Since June 30, 2000, the inmate
population in the District of Columbia has
dropped by 5,825 inmates (down 68% in 18 
months).  On December 31, 2001, the Federal 
system held 6,930 inmates from the District 
of Columbia, up from 4,486 on June 30, 2001, 
and 2,858 on December 31, 2000. Approximately 
58% of the growth in the Federal system in 
the last 6 months of 2001 was the result of 
this transfer of responsibility.  

Excluding the shift of inmates from the
District of Columbia to the Federal system,
the overall drop in the State prison
population in the last 6 months of 2001
totaled 1,261 inmates (a decline of 0.1%).

Sentenced Federal inmate population
rose 9.2% during the last 12 months 

Prisoners with sentences of more than 1
year ("sentenced prisoners") represented
97% of the total State prison population
and 87% of the Federal prison population
at yearend 2001.  During the 12-month
period, the sentenced prison population
grew 1.1%.  The remaining prisoners had
sentences of a year or less or were
currently unsentenced.

While the State sentenced prison
population rose 0.3% during 2001, the
sentenced Federal prison population grew
9.2%.  The Federal prison system added
11,465 sentenced prisoners -- the
equivalent of more than 220 new inmates
per week.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
Prison incarceration rates continue to rise

The incarceration rate of State and Federal 
prisoners sentenced to more than 1 year was 
470 per 100,000 U.S. residents at yearend 2001, 
up from 469 at yearend 2000. Rates of 
incarceration have risen steadily.  Previously 
published rates have changed as a result of 
shifting to population estimates from the 2000
decennial census.  

Incarceration rates prior to yearend 2000
were based on population estimates using
the 1990 Census of Population and Housing.  
The rate at yearend 1999 was 476 per 100,000.  
However, if the 2000 census had been used to 
estimate the yearend 1999 resident population, 
the revised incarceration rate would have
been 463.

Of the 12 States with rates greater than
that for the Nation at yearend 2001, 8 were
in the South, 2 were in the West, and 2
were in the Midwest.  Two States -- Maine
(127) and Minnesota (132) -- had rates
that were less than a third the national
rate.  The District of Columbia, a wholly
urban jurisdiction, was not calculated due
to the transfer of responsibility of
sentenced felons to the Federal system.

Since 1995 the number of sentenced prisoners 
per 100,000 residents has risen from 411 to 
470.  During this period, incarceration rates 
rose most in the South (from 483 to 526) and 
West (from 358 to 408). The rate in the Midwest 
rose from 310 to 370, and the rate in the 
Northeast grew slightly from 301 to 304. The 
number of sentenced Federal prisoners per
100,000 U.S. residents increased from 32
to 48.

Since 1995 the sentenced inmate population 
in State prisons has grown 21%. During this 
period 10 States increased their sentenced 
inmate populations by at least 50%, led by 
North Dakota (up 87%), Idaho (up 81%), and
Oregon (up 75%).  Between 1995 and 2001 the 
Federal system reported an additional 52,846 
inmates sentenced to more than year, an 
increase of 63%.
---------------------------------------------

Louisiana had the highest 
incarceration rate; Maine, the lowest

At yearend 2001 the 10 jurisdictions with
the largest prison populations had under
their jurisdiction 840,864 inmates, 60% of
the Nation's total prison population.  Texas
(162,070), California (159,444), and the
Federal system (156,933) held a third of
the population.  The 10 States with the
smallest prison populations collectively
held 1.8% of the Nation=s total prison
population.

Louisiana had the highest prison incar-
ceration rate (800 sentenced inmates
per 100,000 residents), followed by
Mississippi (715), Texas (711), and
Oklahoma (658).  Six States had prison
incarceration rates below 200, led by
Maine (127), Minnesota (132), and North
Dakota (161). 

Since 1995 two States had average annual 
prison population increases of at least 
10% -- North Dakota (11%) and Idaho (10.3%).  
Massachusetts (-1.8%), Alaska (-1%), and 
New York (-0.2%) had decreases.

Male and female incarceration rates
stable from yearend 2000 to 2001

During 2001 the number of women under
the jurisdiction of State or Federal 
prison authorities decreased by 0.2%, while 
the number of men incarcerated in a State 
or Federal prison rose 1.2%.  At yearend
2001 there were 93,031 women and 1,313,000 
men in State or Federal prisons.

Since 1995 the annual rate of growth of
the female inmate population has averaged 
5.2%, higher than the 3.7% average increase 
in the number of male inmates.  While the 
total number of male prisoners has grown 
24% since 1995, the number of female 
prisoners has increased 36%. By yearend 2001 
women accounted for 6.6% of all prisoners, 
up from 6.1% in 1995. 

Relative to their number in the U.S.
resident population, men were about 15
times more likely than women to be
incarcerated in a State or Federal prison. 
At yearend 2001 there were 58 sentenced
female inmates per 100,000 women in the
United States, compared to 896 sentenced
male inmates per 100,000 men. 

--------------------------------------------
Over a third of all female prisoners were
held in the 3 largest jurisdictions

Texas (12,369), the Federal system (10,973), 
and California (9,921) held more than a third 
of all female inmates.  Oklahoma (with 130 
sentenced female inmates per 100,000 female 
State residents), Mississippi (113), Louisiana
(99), and Texas (96) had the highest female 
incarceration rates.  Those with the lowest 
female incarceration rate were concentrated 
in the Northeast:  Maine (with 8 sentenced 
female prisoners per 100,000 female residents), 
Rhode Island (10), and Massachusetts (13).

Since 1995 the female prisoner population
has grown at an annual average rate of at
least 10% in 13 States.  North Dakota
reported the highest average annual
increase in female prisoners (23%),
followed by Montana (22%), West Virginia
and Idaho (both up 18%), and Wisconsin
(17%).  New York (-2.4%) was the only
State to report a decrease in female
prisoners since 1995.

Privately operated prisons held nearly
92,000 State and Federal inmates in
2001

At yearend 2001, 32 States, the District 
of Columbia, and the Federal system
reported a total of 91,828 prisoners held 
in privately operated facilities.  These 
private facilities held 5.8% of all State 
prisoners and 12.3% of Federal prisoners.  
Among States, Texas (with 16,331 State 
inmates housed in private facilities) and 
Oklahoma (with 6,658) reported the largest 
number in 2000.  Five States -- New Mexico 
(44%), Montana (33%), Alaska (32%), Oklahoma
(29%), and Wyoming (28%) -- had at least
25% of their prison population housed in
private facilities.

Except for Wisconsin (with 16% of its State
inmates in private facilities), North Dakota,
Ohio, and Indiana (with 4%), and New Jersey 
(with 9%), the use of private facilities was 
concentrated among Southern and Western States.  
Overall, 8.1% of State inmates in the South 
and 6.2% in the West were in privately operated 
facilities at the end of 2001.
-----------------------------------------------

Local jails held more than 70,000 
State prisoners 

At the end of 2001, 33 States, the District
of Columbia, and the Federal system reported 
a total of 70,681 State and Federal prisoners 
held in local jails or other facilities 
operated by county or local authorities. These 
inmates held in local jails represented 5% of 
all prisoners in 2001.  Approximately 11% of 
inmates in local jails were being held for 
State or Federal prison authorities.

Louisiana had the largest percentage of its
State inmate population housed in local
jails (45%).  Two other States -- Kentucky
(31%) and Tennessee (26%) --had at least 
25% of their population housed in local jail
facilities.

In addition to housing inmates in privately
operated facilities and local jails (within
their own State and elsewhere), 38 States
and the District of Columbia reported placing 
inmates in Federal facilities and in other 
State-operated facilities. On December 31, 
2001, 6,111 prisoners nationwide were held 
under such arrangements -- representing less 
than 1% of all State prisoners.  California 
placed the most inmates (628), followed by
Connecticut (497), Alabama (491), and Vermont 
(391).  Vermont (23%) had more than 10% of 
its prison population housed in facilities 
of other States or the Federal system.

Prison capacity measures vary

Prison capacity and the extent of crowding
are difficult to determine because of the
absence of uniform measures for defining
capacity.  Jurisdictions apply a variety of
capacity measures to reflect both the
available space to house inmates and the
ability to staff and operate an institution. 
To estimate the capacity of their prisons,
jurisdictions were asked to supply three
measures for yearend 2001: rated, operational, 
and design capacities.

These measures were defined as 
follows:

Rated capacity is the number of beds or
inmates assigned by a rating official to
institutions within the jurisdiction.

Operational capacity is the number of
inmates that can be accommodated,
based on a facility's staff, existing
programs, and services.

Design capacity is the number of inmates
that planners or architects intended for 
the facility. 

Of the 51 reporting jurisdictions, 28
supplied a rated capacity; 42, an
operational capacity; and 33, a design
capacity. 

Nineteen jurisdictions provided only 1
measure or the same figure for each
measure they reported.  For the 28
jurisdictions with more than 1 reported
type of capacity, estimates of population
as a percent of capacity are based on the
highest and lowest figures provided.

22 States and Federal system 
operating at or above highest 
capacity

Prisons generally require reserve capacity
to operate efficiently.  Dormitories and
cells need to be maintained and repaired
periodically, special housing is needed for
protective custody and disciplinary cases,
and space may be needed to cope with
emergencies.

At yearend 2001, 26 States reported that
they were operating at or below 99% of
their highest capacity.  Twenty-two States
and the Federal prison system reported
operating at 100% or more of their highest
capacity.  Rhode Island, which was
operating at 86% of its highest capacity,
reported the lowest percent of capacity
occupied.  California and Montana operating 
at 91% over their lowest reported capacity, 
had the highest percent of capacity occupied.

By yearend 2001 the Federal prison system was 
operating at 31% over capacity, the same as 
the number reported in 2000.  Overall, State 
prisons in 2001 were operating at between 1% 
over their highest capacity and 16% above 
their lowest capacity.

At yearend 2001, 19,137 detainees
were held by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service 

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) reported 19,137 detainees
on December 31, 2001, down from 19,528 at 
yearend 2000.  Though many of these detainees 
(10,376) were held in Federal and State 
prisons and local jails, 4,550 were in INS-
operated facilities and 1,947 in private 
facilities under exclusive contract to the 
INS.

Following the events of September 11,
2001, the number of persons held under
INS jurisdiction rose, peaking at 21,226 
on September 25. Since that time, despite 
weekly fluctuations, the population has 
dropped steadily, reaching a low of 18,268 
on December 22.

Among the 19,137 INS detainees for immigration 
violations at yearend 2001, 10,784 had been convicted
of criminal offenses, and 1,589 had pending
criminal cases.  Detainees convicted of violent offenses
constituted the largest group under INS
jurisdiction (32.5%), followed by those
convicted of drug offenses (32.3%), property
offenses (14.5%), and public order offenses (11.0%).

At yearend 2001 U.S. military 
authorities held 2,436 prisoners in 
59 facilities

About 82% of prisoners held by the Army,
Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps were
convicted inmates; 18% were unconvicted
persons whose cases had not been tried. 
Fifty-five percent of the prisoners (1,332)
had sentences of 1 year or more.  At
yearend 2001 the Army's Disciplinary
Barracks, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and
five other local or regional Army facilities
held the largest share (40%) of all inmates
under military jurisdiction.  The 11 Navy
facilities held nearly 37% of all inmates;
the 6 Marine Corps facilities held 18% of
all inmates; and the 36 Air Force facilities
held 5% of all inmates.

The operational capacity of the 59 military
confinement facilities totaled 4,478 (not
shown in a table).  At yearend 2001 these
facilities were operating at 54% of their
operational capacity.

U.S. Territories held 15,852 inmates 
in 2001

The U.S. Territories and Commonwealths
-- American Samoa, Guam, Northern
Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and Virgin
Islands -- reported 15,852 inmates under
the jurisdiction of their prison systems 
at yearend 2001, a decrease of 1.7% since
2000.  

Prisoners with a sentence of more than 1
year totaled 11,910 (or three-quarters of
the total territorial prison population). 
Since 1995 the number of sentenced prisoners 
held in U.S. Territories has grown 28%, 
compared to the 21% increase in the number 
of sentenced State prisoners. 

Relative to the resident populations in the
Territories, the rate of incarceration was
271 prisoners per 100,000 residents --
less than two-thirds of the combined rate
of the 50 States and the District of
Columbia. Of the 5 Territories, the U.S.
Virgin Islands had the highest prison
incarceration rate (339 inmates per
100,000 residents), followed by Puerto
Rico (with 278).

Puerto Rico, the largest of the Territories,
had the most sentenced prisoners (10,997
at yearend 2001), down from 11,075 in 2000. 
In 2001, 21 States had fewer sentenced inmates 
than Puerto Rico; 12 States had lower 
incarceration rates. 

More black males than white males
among State and Federal inmates at
yearend 2001

At yearend 2001 black non-Hispanic inmates 
represented an estimated 46% of all inmates 
with sentences of more than 1 year, while 
white non-Hispanic inmates accounted for 36% 
and Hispanic inmates, 16%.

Although the total number of sentenced
inmates rose sharply (up 82% between
1990 and 2001), there were only small
changes in the racial and Hispanic
composition of the inmate population.  
At yearend 2001, black males (585,800)
outnumbered white males (449,200) and
Hispanic males (199,700) among inmates
with sentences of more than 1 year. More
than 43% of all sentenced inmates were
black males. 

An estimated 10% of black males, 
age 25-29, in prison in 2001

When incarceration rates are estimated
separately by age group, black males in
their twenties and thirties are found to
have high rates relative to other groups. 
Expressed in terms of percentages, 10.0%
of black non-Hispanic males age 25 to 29
were in prison on December 31, 2001,
compared to 2.9% of Hispanic males and
about 1.2% of white males in the same
age group.  Although incarceration rates
drop with age, the percentage of black
males age 45 to 54 in prison in 2001 was
still nearly 2.7% -- only slightly lower 
than the highest rate (2.9%) among Hispanic
males (age 25 to 29) and more than twice
the highest rate (1.3%) among white males
(age 30 to 34).

Female incarceration rates, though
substantially lower than male incarceration
rates at every age, reveal similar racial
and ethnic disparities. Black non-Hispanic
females (with an incarceration rate of 199
per 100,000) were more than 3 times as
likely as Hispanic females (61 per 100,000) 
and 5 times more likely than white non- 
Hispanic females (36 per 100,000) to be in 
prison on December 31, 2001.  These differences 
among white, black, and Hispanic females were 
consistent across all age groups. 

Growth linked to increasing number 
of inmates in State prison for violent
and drug offenses

Between 1990 and 2000 the distribution of
the four major offense categories -- violent,
property, drug, and public-order offenses --
changed slightly among State prisoners.
The percent held for property and drug
offenses dropped while the percent held 
for violent and public-order offenses rose.
     
In absolute numbers, an estimated 589,100
inmates in State prison at yearend 2000
were held for violent offenses, 158,700 for
robbery, 156,300 for murder, 116,800 for
assault, and 113,900 for rape and other
sexual assaults. In addition, 238,500
inmates were held for property offenses,
251,100 for drug offenses, and 124,600 for
public-order offenses. 

Overall, the largest growth in State inmates
between 1990 and 2000 was among violent
offenders.  During the decade the number
of violent offenders grew 273,200, while
the number of drug offenders grew 101,400.  
As a percentage of the total growth, violent 
offenders accounted for 53% of the growth; 
drug offenders 20%; property offenders 12%; 
and public-order offenders 15%. 

Sources of growth differ among 
men and women and among 
white, black, and Hispanic 
inmates

The increasing number of violent offenders
accounted for 55% of the total growth
among male inmates and 33% among female 
inmates.  Drug offenders accounted for a 
larger portion of the total growth among 
female inmates (33%), compared to 19% among 
male inmates.  

The increasing number of property offenders 
accounted for a slightly higher percent of 
the growth among female inmates (19%)than 
male inmates (12%).

Although the number of public-order
offenders rose sharply, they accounted for
only 15% of the total growth among male
inmates and 16% of the growth among
female inmates.

The sources of population growth also
differed among white, black, and  Hispanic
prisoners.  Overall, the increasing number
of drug offenses accounted for 27% of the
total growth among black inmates, 7% of
the total growth among Hispanic inmates,
and 15% of the growth among white inmates.  
Violent offenders accounted for the largest 
source of growth for all groups -- among 
white State inmates (49%), black inmates 
(52%), and Hispanic inmates (69%).

Changing Federal prison population
related to drugs, weapons, and 
immigration violations

Prisoners sentenced for drug offenses
constitute the largest group of Federal
inmates (57%) in 2000, up from 53% in
1990. On September 30, 2000, the date of
the latest available data in the Federal
Justice Statistics Program, Federal prisons
held 73,389 sentenced drug offenders,
compared to 30,470 at yearend 1990.  

Between 1990 and 2000, the number of
Federal inmates held for immigration
offenses increased 691%, and the number
held for weapons offenses increased
247%. The number of immigration
offenders rose from 1,728 in 1990 to
13,676 in 2000; weapons offenders rose
from 3,073 to 10,652. By September 30,
2000, weapons offenders represented
8.2% of Federal inmates and immigration
violators 10.6%. Although the number of
robbers showed an increase of 83% between 
1990 and 2000, the increase was offset 
by a decline of nearly 9% among offenders 
held for homicide and 24% among other violent 
offenders (such as inmates held for assault 
and sex offenses). 

Overall, the percentage of violent Federal 
inmates declined from 17% to 10%. While
the number of offenders in each major
offense category increased, the number
incarcerated for a drug offense accounted
for the largest percentage of the total
growth (59%), followed by public-order
offenders (32%).

Methodology
 
National Prisoner Statistics

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS),
with the U.S. Census Bureau as its
collection agent, obtains yearend and
midyear counts of prisoners from departments 
of correction in each of the 50 States, the 
District of Columbia, and the Federal Bureau 
of Prisons.  

In an effort to collect comparable data from
all jurisdictions, National Prisoner
Statistics (NPS) distinguishes prisoners in
custody from those under jurisdiction. To
have custody of a prisoner, a State must
hold that person in one of its facilities. To
have jurisdiction means that a State has
legal authority over the prisoner. Prisoners 
under a State's jurisdiction may be in the 
custody of a local jail, another State's 
prison, or other correctional facility. 
Some States are unable to provide both
custody and jurisdiction counts. (See NPS
jurisdiction notes.)

Excluded from NPS counts are persons
confined in locally administered
confinement facilities who are under the
jurisdiction of local authorities.  NPS
counts include all inmates in State-operated 
facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, 
Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which have
combined jail-prison systems.

Military Corrections Statistics

BJS obtains yearend counts of prisoners in
the custody of U.S. military authorities
from the Department of Defense Corrections 
Council. In 1994 the council, comprised of 
representatives from each branch of military 
service, adopted a standardized report (DD 
Form 2720) with a common set of items and 
definitions. This report provides information 
on persons held in U.S. military confinement 
facilities inside and outside the continental 
United States, by branch of service, sex, 
race, Hispanic origin, conviction status,
sentence length, and offense.  It also
includes data on the number of facilities,
and their design and rated capacities.
