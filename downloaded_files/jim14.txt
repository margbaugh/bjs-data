Bulletin

Jail Inmates at Midyear 2014 

Todd D. Minton and Zhen Zeng, Ph.D.,
BJS Statisticians

The number of inmates confined in county
and city jails was an estimated 744,600 at
midyear 2014 (figure 1, table 1). The jail
population remained steady at the 2012 level and
was significantly lower than the peak of an estimated
785,500 at midyear 2008. Since 2000, the jail inmate
population increased about 1% each year.

The jail incarceration rate--the confined jail
population per 100,000 U.S. residents--decreased
steadily from a peak of 259 inmates per 100,000 at
midyear 2007 to 234 per 100,000 at midyear 2014.
The adult only jail incarceration rate has also declined
from a high of 340 inmates per 100,000 at midyear
2007 to 302 per 100,000 at midyear 2014.

This report summarizes data from the Annual
Survey of Jails (ASJ) which is conducted in years
between the complete census of local jails. ASJ uses
a stratified probability sample of jail jurisdictions
to estimate the number and characteristics of local
inmates nationwide. The 2014 ASJ sample consisted
of 891 jail jurisdictions, represented by 942 jail
facilities (referred to as reporting units). This sample
represents about 2,750 jail jurisdictions nationwide. Local 
jail jurisdictions include counties (parishes in Louisiana) 
or municipal governments that administer one or more local jails.

HIGHLIGHTS
*************

* The number of inmates confined in county and city jails was an 
estimated 744,600 at midyear 2014. The jail population remained 
steady at the 2012 level and was significantly lower than the 
peak of an estimated 785,500 inmates at midyear 2008. 

* Since 2000, the jail inmate population increased about 1% each 
year.

* The jail incarceration rate decreased from a peak of 259 per 
100,000 in 2007 to 234 per 100,000 at midyear 2014. The adult 
only jail incarceration rate declined from a high of 340 per 
100,000 in 2007 to 302 per 100,000 at midyear 2014.

* The female inmate population increased 18.1% between midyear 
2010 and 2014, while the male population declined 3.2%. 

* White inmates accounted for 47% of the total jail population, 
blacks represented 35%, and Hispanics represented 15%.

* About 4,200 juveniles age 17 or younger were held in local 
jails at midyear 2014. They accounted for 0.6% of the confined 
population, down from 1.2% at midyear 2000. 

* Nearly 90% or 3,700 juvenile inmates were tried or awaiting 
trial in adult court. The number of juveniles not charged as an 
adult declined by 74% between midyear 2010 and 2014 (from 1,900 
to 500 inmates).

* Since 2000, 95% of the growth in the overall jail inmate 
population (123,500) was due to the increase in the unconvicted 
population (117,700 inmates) and 5% was due to the increase in 
the convicted population (5,800 inmates). 

* Local jails admitted about 11.4 million persons during the 
12-month period ending June 30, 2014, remaining stable since 
2011 (11.8 million) and down from a peak of 13.6 million in 
2008.

*************************************************************

Males have made up at least 85% of the jail population since
2000. The female inmate population increased 18.1% (up
16,700 inmates) between midyear 2010 and 2014, while
the male population declined 3.2% (down 20,900 inmates)
(table 2, table 3). The female jail population grew by an
average of about 1.6% every year between 2005 and 2014. In
comparison, the male jail population declined by 0.3% every
year since 2005 (not shown).

White inmates accounted for 47% of the total jail population,
blacks represented 35%, and Hispanics represented 15% at
midyear 2014. From midyear 2010 to 2014, white inmates
increased by 21,200, while black (19,400) and Hispanic (7,500)
inmates declined.

About 4,200 juveniles age 17 or younger were held in local
jails at midyear 2014. They accounted for 0.6% of the confined
population, down from 1.2% at midyear 2000. Nearly 90%
or 3,700 juvenile inmates were tried or awaiting trial in
adult court. The number of juveniles not charged as an adult
declined by 74% between midyear 2010 and 2014 (from 1,900
to 500 inmates).

At midyear 2014, about 6 in 10 inmates were not convicted, but
were in jail awaiting court action on a current charge—a rate
unchanged since 2005. About 4 in 10 inmates were sentenced
offenders or convicted offenders awaiting sentencing. From
midyear 2013 to 2014, the number of unconvicted inmates
and the number of convicted inmates remained statistically
the same. Since 2000, 95% of the growth in the overall jail
inmate population (up 123,500) was due to the increase in the
unconvicted population (up 117,700 inmates) and 5% was due
to the increase in the convicted population (up 5,800 inmates).

*****************************************
Nearly half of jail inmates were held 
in less than 10% of jails 
*****************************************


The largest jails (those with an average daily population
(ADP) of 1,000 or more inmates) held 47% of the jail inmate
population at midyear 2014, but accounted for 6% of all jail
jurisdictions nationwide (table 4). In comparison, the smallest
jail jurisdictions (those with an ADP of less than 50 inmates)
held 3% of the inmate population, but accounted for 38% of
all jail jurisdictions. Jail jurisdictions with an ADP of 50 to
99 inmates and 100 to 249 inmates accounted for about 20%
each of jail jurisdictions. Combined, these jail jurisdictions
held 19% of all inmates. Jail jurisdictions with an ADP of 250
to 999 inmates accounted for 17% of all jail jurisdictions, but
held 31% of all inmates at midyear 2014. Similar patterns were
observed in 2013 for all categories.

*****************************************
Increase in new bed space between 2013 
and 2014 was similar to the average 
annual increase between 2000 and 2013 
*****************************************

Rated capacity in jails reached an estimated 890,500 beds at
midyear 2014, an increase of nearly 4% from 857,900 beds
at midyear 2010 (figure 2, table 5). Rated capacity is the
maximum number of beds or inmates allocated to each jail
facility by a state or local rating official.

Since peaking in 2007 (96%), the percentage of rated capacity
occupied at midyear 2014 (84%) was the lowest since 2000. At
midyear 2014, jail jurisdictions holding 250 or more inmates
reported a higher percentage of occupied bed space (85% to
87%) than smaller jail jurisdictions holding fewer than 250
inmates (67% to 79%) (table 6).

In addition to the ratio of midyear jail population to rated
capacity, two additional measures can be used to measure jail
crowding—the ratio of ADP in a year to rated capacity, and
the ratio of the number of inmates on the most crowded day
in June to rated capacity. Using these measures, the nation’s
jails operated at about 83% of rated capacity on an average day
and about 89% of rated capacity on their most crowded day in
June 2014.

While the confined population and rated jail capacity both
increased at roughly comparable rates from 2000 through
2008, the growth rates have diverged since 2008. The confined
population declined by 0.9% on average per year, while rated
capacity increased by 1.2% on average per year. The increase
in capacity and decrease in confined population almost
equally contributed to the decline in the percentage of capacity
occupied, from 95% at midyear 2008 to 84% at midyear 2014.

From midyear 2008 to 2014, jail jurisdictions holding 100 to
249 inmates experienced the largest percentage increase
in rated capacity relative to population change (figure 3).
These jurisdictions reported an 18% increase in their rated
capacity and a small increase (less than 1%) in their inmate
population. The smallest jail jurisdictions, which held fewer
than 50 inmates, reported the smallest percentage increase in
rated capacity (up 4.9%) relative to population change (down
1.2%). Jails holding more than 250 inmates experienced a
decline in their midyear jail population and an increase in their
rated capacity.

*****************************************
Local jails admitted 11.4 million persons
during the 12-month period ending midyear 
2014 
*****************************************

Local jails admitted an estimated 11.4 million persons during
the 12-month period ending June 30, 2014, a stable estimate
since 2011 (11.8 million), but down from a peak of 13.6 million
admissions in 2008. The number of persons admitted in 2014
was 15 times the size of the ADP (an estimated 739,000)
during the 12-month period ending June 30, 2014. (See
Methodology for methods used to estimate admissions.)

Nearly 4 in 10 admissions to jail during the last week of
June 2014 were to the largest jail jurisdictions (table 7). In
comparison, jail jurisdictions holding fewer than 50 inmates
accounted for 6% of all jail admissions. For these jurisdictions,
the number of inmates admitted was 28 times the size of
the ADP between midyear 2013 and 2014. These small jail
jurisdictions also experienced the highest turnover rate
(104%), measured as the change in admissions and releases by
the ADP. (See Methodology for detail.) The turnover rate was
the smallest in large jail jurisdictions (49%). Higher turnover
rates mean larger numbers of admissions and releases relative
to the size of the ADP.

Methodology 
***************

Annual Survey of Jails 
*************************

In years between the complete census of local jails, the Bureau 
of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducts the Annual Survey of Jails 
(ASJ). ASJ uses a stratified probability sample of jail 
jurisdictions to estimate the number and characteristics of local 
inmates nationwide. The 2014 ASJ sample consisted of 891 jail 
jurisdictions, represented by 942 jail facilities (referred to as 
reporting units). This sample represents about 2,750 jail 
jurisdictions nationwide. Local jail jurisdictions include 
counties (parishes in Louisiana) or municipal governments that 
administer one or more local jails.

In the sampling design, the jail jurisdictions nationwide were 
grouped into 10 strata. The 10 strata were defined by the 
interaction of two variables: the jail jurisdiction average daily 
population (ADP) in 2005, and whether in 2005 the jurisdiction 
held at least one juvenile. For 8 of the 10 strata, a random 
sample of jail jurisdictions was selected. For the remaining two 
strata, all jurisdictions were included in the sample. One 
stratum consisted of all jails (70) that were operated jointly by 
two or more jurisdictions (referred to as multi-jurisdictional 
jails). The other stratum (referred to as certainty stratum) 
consisted of all jail jurisdictions (267) that—

* held juvenile inmates at the time of the 2005 Census of Jail 
Inmates and had an ADP of 500 or more inmates during the 12 
months ending June 30, 2005.

* held only adult inmates and had an ADP of 750 or more. 

The sampling design used for the 2014 ASJ is the same as the 
design used for the 2013 ASJ. The 2013 ASJ differed from the 
2006–2012 ASJs in that it included in the sample, with a 
probability of one, all California jail jurisdictions in response 
to the two enacted laws—AB 109 and AB 117 by the California State 
Legislature and governor—to reduce the number of inmates housed 
in state prisons starting October 1, 2011. The inclusion of all 
California jail jurisdictions resulted in an additional 21 jail 
jurisdictions (for a total sample size of 891 jurisdictions). 
Since the enactment of the two laws in recent years, the 
California jail population has experienced changes in size that 
cannot be compared to the changes of any other state?in the U.S. 
For this reason, the California jail jurisdictions were put in 
separate strata so that they could represent only California 
jurisdictions. The same sampling design was adopted for the 
California jurisdictions. 
BJS obtained data from sampled jail jurisdictions by mailed and 
web-based survey questionnaires. After follow-up phone calls and 
facsimiles, the item response rate for jails that responded to 
the survey was nearly 100% for critical items, such as the number 
of inmates confined, ADP, and rated capacity. (See appendix 
tables 1 to 7 for standard errors associated with reported 
estimates from the 2014 ASJ.)

Response rate, nonresponse adjustment, 
and out-of-scope jail facilities 
*****************************************

The 2014 ASJ sample initially comprised 942 reporting units. 
However, 12 units were out-of-scope for the 2014 data collection 
because they had closed either permanently or temporarily, which 
resulted in a sample of 930 active respondents. Ninety-three 
percent (or 878) of the 930 active individual reporting units 
responded to the 2014 data collection, and 52 active individual 
reporting units did not respond to the survey.

BJS implemented nonresponse weight adjustment procedures to 
account for unit nonresponse, as it did in 2011 to 2013.

Respondent indicators
*************************

The respondent reporting unit indicator JAILRhij is set for each 
individual reporting unit j in jurisdiction i in stratum h on the 
file, based on the status of the individual reporting unit.



The respondent jurisdiction indicator JURISRhi is set for each 
jurisdiction i in stratum h on the file, based on the value of 
JAILRhij for the reporting units within the jurisdiction.

Active indicators
*******************

The active reporting unit indicator JAILAhij is set for each 
individual reporting unit j in jurisdiction i in stratum h on the 
file, based on the status of the individual reporting unit.
  
The active jurisdiction indicator JURISAhi is set for each 
jurisdiction i in stratum h on the file, based on the value of 
JAILAhij for the reporting units within the jurisdiction.

Nonresponse weighting adjustment factor
*****************************************

The nonresponse weighting adjustment factor is calculated within 
each stratum. BJS uses the sample weights in the nonresponse 
adjustment factor. The nonresponse weighting adjustment factor 
F2h is calculated as

where

nh = number of jurisdictions sampled in stratum h,

whi = sample weight for jurisdiction i in stratum h.

Final weight
**************

The final weight FWhi for each jail jurisdiction on the 2014 ASJ 
data file is calculated as

where

whi = sample weight for jurisdiction i in stratum h.

JAILRhi is used to set the final weight to 0 for units that are 
closed, out-of-scope, or nonrespondents.

Final weight post-stratification: California jail 
jurisdictions and the Public Safety Realignment 
***************************************************

Because of the California Public Safety Realignment, between 
midyear 2011 and midyear 2014, California jails experienced a 
significant increase in the number of inmates (about 13,900 
inmates) that was not experienced by jails nationwide. To capture 
this jail population growth in California more accurately, all 
California jurisdictions were added to the ASJ sample in 2013. 
Accordingly, BJS computed new weights to ensure that the sampled 
California jail jurisdictions represent California jurisdictions 
only. Without computing these new weights, the estimated 
nationwide jail population would be erroneously inflated.

The post-stratification final weight adjustment is calculated for 
each stratum from which California jurisdictions were sampled. 
More specifically for each stratum, two new strata and set of 
weights were created: one for the California jurisdictions 
(PSCAh) and one for the non-California jurisdictions (PSCAh). In 
2013, all California jail jurisdictions were included in the 
sample; however, not all of them responded.

The weight adjustment for California jail jurisdictions is 
computed as

Where

NCAh = number of active California jurisdictions in stratum h,

nCAh = number of sampled California jurisdictions in stratum h

In 2014, all 63 California jail jurisdictions responded, so their 
final weights post-stratification were 1.

The post-stratification adjustment for non-California jail 
jurisdictions is computed as

where

NCAh = number of active non-California jail jurisdictions in 
stratum h, computed as 

nCAh = number of sampled non-California jail jurisdictions in 
stratum h.

*****************************
Item nonresponse imputation 
****************************

Critical items: Midyear inmate population, 
ADP, and rated capacity 
*****************************************

Based on the 2014 ASJ, about 99% of the 878 individual reporting 
units provided valid data on their midyear inmate population 
(872), ADP (864), and rated capacity (869). To calculate a 
national midyear inmate population, ADP, and rated capacity 
estimate, data were estimated for the reporting units that did 
not report specific data.
 
Estimates were calculated based on the following criteria: 

* Data for 1 individual reporting unit included midyear inmate 
population data based on the 2014 ASJ. 

* Data for 5 individual reporting units included midyear inmate 
population data based on estimates from the 2013 ASJ.

* Data for 9 individual reporting units included ADP data based 
on their confined population at midyear 2014.

* Data for 5 individual reporting units included ADP data based 
on estimates from the 2013 ASJ.

* Data for 9 individual reporting units included rated capacity 
data based on estimates from the 2013 ASJ.

Inmate characteristics 
************************

Based on the 2014 ASJ, 90% to 95% of the 878 individual reporting 
units provided valid data on sex, age, race/Hispanic origin, and 
inmate conviction status. To calculate a national rate for inmate 
characteristics, data were estimated based on the ratio of the 
reported characteristic population to the total midyear confined 
population.

Weekly admission and release 
estimation procedures 
********************************

Based on the 2014 ASJ, 841 of the 878 individual reporting
units (96%) provided valid data on weekly admissions
or releases. To calculate an overall weekly estimate, data
on offender flows through local jails were estimated for
the 37 reporting units that did not report specific data on
admissions and releases. Release data were estimated for 5
reporting units that reported data on admissions, but not on
releases. Nonresponse weight adjustments account for the
survey nonrespondents.

Estimates were calculated based on the following criteria:

* Data for 3 individual reporting units included admission and 
release data based on estimates from the 2012 ASJ.

* Data for 29 individual reporting units included admission and 
release data based on estimates from the 2013 ASJ.

* Release data for 5 individual reporting units were based on 
admission data reported in 2014.

Calculating annual admissions
*****************************************

The ASJ collects data on weekly admissions. BJS determined
that the June admission data from the 2004 Survey of Large
Jails (SLJ) were a reliable source to calculate a nationwide
annual admission estimate. Although the number of
admissions to jails fluctuated throughout the year, the SLJ
tracked monthly movements from January 2003 to January
2004 and showed that the June 2003 count (339,500) closely
matched the annual average number of admissions (342,956).
The number of annual admissions was calculated by
multiplying the weekly admissions by 365 days and dividing by
7 days.

Calculating weekly turnover rates 
*************************************

Weekly jail turnover rates were modeled after the Bureau of
Labor Statistics’ Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey.
Additional information on turnover rates is available at http://
www.bls.gov/jlt/. Jail turnover rates were calculated by adding
admissions and releases, and then dividing by the ADP. The
turnover rate takes into account jail admissions and releases
and gives an indication of the fluctuation of the jail population.

Jurisdiction size categories 
*********************************

For the 2011 through 2014 reports, BJS categorized jurisdiction
sizes based on the ADP during the 12 months ending midyear
2006 (the first year in the current ASJ series). For the 2010
report, comparisons of size categories from midyear 2009 to
midyear 2010 were based on the ADP during the 12 months
ending midyear 2009. In previous reports (2007 through 2009),
the size category comparisons were based on the 12 months
ending midyear of the specific collection year. As a result,
not all data in previous reports are comparable with data in
this report.

Standard errors and tests of significance
******************************************

As with any survey, the ASJ estimates are subject to error
arising from sampling rather than using a complete
enumeration of the jail population. A common way to express
this sampling variability is to construct a 95% confidence
interval around each survey estimate. Typically, multiplying
the standard error by 1.96 and then adding or subtracting the
result from the estimate produces the confidence interval. This
interval expresses the range of values that could result among
95% of the different samples that could be drawn.

Jail functions 
*****************

Jails in the ASJ include confinement facilities--usually
administered by a local law enforcement agency--that are
intended for adults but may hold juveniles before or after
they are adjudicated. Facilities include jails and city or county
correctional centers; special jail facilities, such as medical or
treatment release centers, halfway houses, and work farms; and
temporary holding or lockup facilities that are part of the jail’s
combined function. Inmates sentenced to jail facilities usually
have a sentence of 1 year or less.

Within the ASJ, jails--

* receive individuals pending arraignment and hold them
awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing

* re-admit probation, parole, and bail bond violators and
absconders

* temporarily detain juveniles pending their transfer to juvenile 
authorities 

* hold mentally ill persons pending their movement to
appropriate mental health facilities 

* hold individuals for the military, for protective custody, 
for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses

* release convicted inmates to the community upon
completion of sentence

* transfer inmates to federal, state, or other authorities

* house inmates for federal, state, or other authorities because
of crowding of their facilities

* sometimes operate community-based programs as alternatives 
to incarceration.

Terms and definitions 
***********************

Admissions--Persons who are officially booked and housed in jails 
by formal legal document and the authority of the courts or some 
other official agency. Jail admissions include persons sentenced 
to weekend programs and those who are booked into the facility 
for the first time. Excluded from jail admissions are inmates re-
entering the facility after an escape, work release, medical 
appointment or treatment facility appointment, and bail and court 
appearances. BJS collects jail admissions for the last 7 days in 
June. 

Average daily population (ADP)—The average is derived by the sum 
of inmates in jail each day for a year, divided by the number of 
days in the year (i.e., between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2014).
 
Average annual change--The mean average change across a 12-month 
time period. 

Calculating annual admissions--BJS collects the number
of jail admissions during the last 7 days in June. Annual jail
admissions are calculated by multiplying weekly admissions by
the sum of 365 days divided by 7 days.

Calculating weekly jail turnover rate--This rate is calculated
by adding admissions and releases and dividing by the average
daily population. See Calculating weekly turnover rates for
additional information.

Inmates confined at midyear--The number of inmates held in custody 
on the last weekday in June. 

Jail incarceration rate--The number of inmates held in the
custody of local jails, per 100,000 U.S. residents.

Percent of capacity occupied--This percentage is calculated
by taking the number of inmates (midyear or average daily
population), dividing by the rated capacity, and multiplying
by 100.

Rated capacity--The number of beds or inmates assigned
by a rating official to a facility, excluding separate temporary
holding areas.

Releases--Persons released after a period of confinement
(e.g., sentence completion, bail or bond releases, other pretrial
releases, transfers to other jurisdictions, and deaths). Releases
include those persons who have completed their weekend
program and who are leaving the facility for the last time.
Excluded from jail releases are temporary discharges including
work release, medical appointment or treatment center, court
appearance, furlough, day reporting, and transfers to other
facilities within the jail’s jurisdiction.

Under jail supervision but not confined--This classification
includes all persons in community-based programs operated
by a jail facility. These programs include electronic monitoring,
house arrest, community service, day reporting, and work
programs. The classification excludes persons on pretrial
release and who are not in a community-based program run
by the jail, as well as persons under supervision of probation,
parole, or other agencies; inmates on weekend programs; and
inmates who participate in work release programs and return
to the jail at night.

Weekend programs--Offenders in these programs are allowed to serve 
their sentences of confinement only on weekends (i.e., Friday to 
Sunday).
