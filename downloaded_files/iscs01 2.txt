  FOREWORD
  
  The safety of our students, teachers, and 
  staff at school continues to be the focus 
  of considerable national attention. National 
  indicators affirm that the levels of crime 
  in school have continued to decline, that 
  acts that promote fear and detract from 
  learning are decreasing, and that students 
  feel more safe in school than they did a 
  few years ago. Despite declining rates, 
  students ages 12 through 18 were victims 
  of about 2.5 million crimes of violence or 
  theft at school in 1999. Violence, theft, 
  bullying, drugs, and firearms still remain 
  problems in many schools throughout the 
  country and periodically the news headlines 
  relate the details of a tragic event in a 
  school somewhere in America. 
  
  Effective programs and policies can only be 
  built on foundations supported by accurate 
  information about the nature, extent, and 
  scope of the problems being addressed. This 
  report is intended to build a foundation of 
  information that will assist in developing 
  policies and/or programs to prevent and cope 
  with violence and crime in schools.
  
  This is the fourth edition of Indicators of 
  School Crime and Safety, a joint effort by 
  the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the 
  National Center for Education Statistics. 
  The report provides detailed statistical 
  information to inform the nation on the 
  current nature of crime in schools. This 
  edition of Indicators contains the most 
  recent available data on school crime and 
  safety drawn from a number of statistical 
  series supported by the federal government. 
  These data include results from a study 
  of violent deaths in school, sponsored by 
  the U.S. Department of Education and the 
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 
  the 1999 National Crime Victimization Survey, 
  which is conducted by the Census Bureau on 
  behalf of the Bureau of Justice Statistics; 
  and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, sponsored 
  by the Centers for Disease Control and 
  Prevention.
  
  The Bureau of Justice Statistics and the 
  National Center for Education Statistics 
  continue to work toward providing more 
  timely and complete data on the issue of 
  school-related violence and safety. Not 
  only is this report available on the 
  Internet in its entirety, but individual 
  indicators are updated there throughout 
  the year as new data become available.

  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
  
  Schools should be safe and secure places 
  for all students, teachers, and staff 
  members. Without a safe learning environment, 
  teachers cannot teach and students cannot 
  learn. Student safety is of concern outside 
  of school as well. In fact, as the data in 
  this report show, more serious victimizations 
  happen away from school than at school.
  ***Footnote 1: These data do not take into
  account the number of hours that students 
  spend on school property and the number of 
  hours they spend elsewhere.***  In 1999, 
  students were more than two times as 
  likely to be victims of serious violent 
  crime away from school as at school 
  (Indicator 2).***Footnote 2: "Students"
  refers to persons 12 though 18 years of age
  who have attended any grade equal to less
  than high school.  An uncertain percentage
  of these persons may not have attended
  school druing the survey reference period.*** 
  
  In 1999, students ages 12 through 18 were 
  victims of about 2.5 million total crimes 
  at school. In that same year, these students 
  were victims of about 186,000 serious violent 
  crimes at school (that is, rape, sexual 
  assault, robbery, and aggravated assault) 
  (Indicator 2). There were also 47 school-
  associated violent deaths in the United 
  States between July 1, 1998, and June 30, 
  1999, including 38 homicides, 33 of which 
  involved school-aged children (Indicator 1).
  
  The total nonfatal victimization rate for
   young people generally declined between 
  1992 and 1999. The percentage of students 
  being victimized at school also declined 
  over the last few years. Between 1995 and 
  1999, the percentage of students who re-
  ported being victims of crime at school 
  decreased from 10 percent to 8 percent 
  (Indicator 3). This decline was due in 
  large part to the decrease in percentages 
  of students in grades 7 through 9 who were 
  victimized. Between 1995 and 1999, the 
  prevalence of reported victimization 
  dropped from 11 percent to 8 percent for 
  7th graders, from 11 percent to 8 percent 
  for 8th graders, and from 12 percent to 
  9 percent for 9th graders.
  
  However, the prevalence rates of some 
  types of crimes at school have not changed. 
  For example, between 1993 and 1999, the 
  percentage of students in grades 9 through 
  12 who were threatened or injured with a 
  weapon on school property in the past 12 
  months remained constant-at about 7 to 8 
  percent (Indicator 4). 
  
  As the rate of victimization in schools 
  has declined or remained constant, students 
  also seem to feel more secure at school 
  now than just a few years ago. The 
  percentage of students ages 12 through 
  18 who reported avoiding one or more 
  places at school for their own safety 
  decreased between 1995 and 1999-from 9 
  to 5 percent (Indicator 13). Furthermore, 
  the percentage of students who reported 
  that street gangs were present at their 
  schools decreased from 1995 to 1999. In 
  1999, 17 percent of students ages 12 
  through 18 reported that they had street 
  gangs at their schools compared with 29 
  percent in 1995 (Indicator 15). 
  
  There was an increase in the use of 
  marijuana among students in grades 9 
  through 12 between 1993 and 1995, but 
  percentages of students reporting 
  marijuana use were similar in 1995, 1997, 
  and 1999. In 1999, about 27 percent of 
  these students had used marijuana in the 
  last 30 days (Indicator 18). Furthermore, 
  in 1995, 1997, and 1999, about one-third 
  of these students (between 30 and 32 
  percent) reported that someone had offered, 
  sold, or given them an illegal drug on 
  school property-an increase from 24 
  percent in 1993 (Indicator 19). Therefore, 
  the data shown in this report present a 
  mixed picture of school safety. While 
  overall school crime rates have declined, 
  violence, gangs, and drugs are still 
  present, indicating that more work needs 
  to be done. 
  
  ORGANIZATION OF THE CURRENT REPORT
  
  This report, the fourth in a series of 
  annual reports on school crime and safety 
  from the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
  (BJS) and the National Center for Education 
  Statistics (NCES), presents the latest 
  available data on school crime and 
  student safety. The report repeats many 
  indicators from the 2000 report but also 
  provides updated data on fatal and 
  nonfatal student victimization, nonfatal 
  teacher victimization, students being 
  threatened or injured with a weapon at 
  school, fights at school, students 
  carrying weapons to school, students' 
  use of alcohol and marijuana, and student 
  reports of drug availability on school 
  property. 
  
  The report is organized as a series 
  of indicators, with each indicator 
  presenting data on a different aspect 
  of school crime and safety. It starts 
  with the most serious violence. There 
  are five sections to the report: Violent 
  Deaths at School; Nonfatal Student 
  Victimization--Student Reports; Violence 
  and Crime at School--Public School
  Principal/Disciplinarian Reports; 
  Nonfatal Teacher Victimization at School--
  Teacher Reports; and School Environment. 
  Each section contains a set of indicators 
  that, taken together, describe a distinct 
  aspect of school crime and safety.
  
  Rather than relying on data from a large 
  omnibus survey of school crime and safety, 
  this report uses a variety of independent 
  data sources from federal departments and 
  agencies including the BJS, NCES, and the 
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
  Each data source has an independent sample 
  design, data collection method, and 
  questionnaire design, all of which may be 
  influenced by the unique perspective of 
  the primary funding agency. By combining 
  multiple and independent sources of data, 
  it is hoped that this report will present 
  a more complete portrait of school crime 
  and safety than would be possible with any 
  single source of information. 
  
  However, because the report relies on 
  so many different data sets, the age 
  groups, the time periods, and the types 
  of respondents analyzed can vary from 
  indicator to indicator. Readers should 
  keep this in mind as they compare data 
  from different indicators. Furthermore, 
  while every effort has been made to 
  keep key definitions consistent across 
  indicators, different surveys sometimes 
  use different definitions, such as 
  those for specific crimes and "at 
  school."***Footnote 3: Readers should 
  consult the glossary of terms in appendix
  C for specific definitions used in each 
  survey.***   Therefore, caution should 
  be used in making comparisons between 
  results from different data sets. 
  Descriptions of these data sets are 
  located in appendix B of this report. 
  KEY FINDINGS
  
  All of the comparisons described in this 
  report were statistically significant at 
  the 0.05 level. Some of the key findings 
  from the various sections of this report 
  are as follows:***Footnote 4: See appendix
  B for details on the statistical 
  methodology.***
  
  VIOLENT DEATHS AT SCHOOL
  
  From July 1, 1998, through June 30, 1999, 
  there were 47 school-associated violent 
  deaths in the United States. Thirty-eight 
  of these violent deaths were homicides, 
  six were suicides, two were killed by a 
  law enforcement officer in the line of 
  duty, and one was unintentional 
  (Indicator 1). Thirty-three of the 38 
  school-associated homicides were of 
  school-aged children. By comparison, a 
  total of 2,407 children ages 5 through 
  19 were victims of homicide in the 
  United States from July 1, 1998, through 
  June 30, 1999. Four of the six school-
  associated suicides occurring from July 
  1, 1998, through June 30, 1999, were of 
  school-aged children. A total of 1,854 
  children ages 5 through 19 committed 
  suicide that year.
  
  NONFATAL STUDENT VICTIMIZATION--
  STUDENT REPORTS
  
  Students ages 12 through 18 were more 
  likely to be victims of nonfatal serious 
  violent crime-including rape, sexual 
  assault, robbery, and aggravated assault-
  away from school than when they were at 
  school (Indicator 2). In 1999, students 
  in this age range were victims of about 
  476,000 serious violent crimes away from 
  school, compared with about 186,000 at 
  school.
  
  *  The percentage of students in grades 
  9 through 12 who have been threatened or 
  injured with a weapon on school 
  property ***Footnote 5: Definitions for
  "on school property" and "at school" may
  differ.  See appendix C for specific
  definitions.*** has not changed s
  ignificantly in recent years. In 1993, 
  1995, 1997, and 1999, about 7 to 8 percent 
  of students reported being threatened or 
  injured with a weapon such as a gun, 
  knife, or club on school property in the 
  past 12 months (Indicator 4).
  
  *  In 1999, 12- through 18-year-old 
  students living in urban and suburban 
  locales were equally vulnerable to seri-
  ous violent crime at school. Away from 
  school, however, urban students were more 
  vulnerable to serious violent crime than 
  were suburban students, and suburban 
  students were more likely to experience 
  serious violent victimization than were 
  rural students. Yet, student vulnerability 
  to theft at school and away from school in 
  1999 was similar in urban, suburban, and 
  rural areas (Indicator 2).
  
  *  Younger students (ages 12 through 14) 
  were more likely than older students (ages 
  15 through 18) to be victims of crime at 
  school. However, older students were more 
  likely than younger students to be victimized 
  away from school (Indicator 2).
  
  VIOLENCE AND CRIME AT SCHOOL--PUBLIC SCHOOL 
  PRINCIPAL/DISCIPLINARIAN REPORTS
  
  In 1996-97, 10 percent of all public 
  schools reported at least one serious 
  violent crime to the police or a law 
  enforcement representative. Principals' 
  reports of serious violent crimes included 
  murder, rape or other type of sexual 
  battery, suicide, physical attack or fight 
  with a weapon, or robbery. Another 47 
  percent of public schools reported at 
  least one less serious violent or nonviolent 
  crime (but not a serious violent one). 
  Crimes in this category include physical 
  attack or fight without a weapon, theft/
  larceny, and vandalism. The remaining 43 
  percent of public schools did not report 
  any of these crimes to the police 
  (Indicator 7).
  
  *  Elementary schools were much less 
  likely than either middle or high schools 
  to report any type of crime in 1996-97. 
  Elementary schools were much more likely 
  to report vandalism (31 percent) than any 
  other crime (19 percent or less) 
  (Indicator 8).
  
  *  At the middle and high school levels, 
  physical attack or fight without a weapon 
  was generally the most commonly reported 
  crime in 1996-97 (9 and 8 per 1,000 students,
  respectively). Theft or larceny was more 
  common at the high school than at the middle 
  school level (6 versus 4 per 1,000 students) 
  (Indicator 8).
  
  NONFATAL TEACHER VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL--
  TEACHER REPORTS
  
  Over the 5-year period from 1995 through 
  1999, teachers were victims of approximately 
  1,708,000 nonfatal crimes at school, 
  including 1,073,000 thefts and 635,000 
  violent crimes (rape or sexual assault, 
  robbery, and aggravated and simple assault) 
  (Indicator 9). On average, this translates 
  into 79 crimes per 1,000 teachers per year.
  
  *  During the 1995 through 1999 period, 
  senior high school and middle/junior high 
  school teachers were more likely to be 
  victims of violent crimes (most of which 
  were simple assaults) than elementary school 
  teachers (38 and 54, respectively, versus 
  16 crimes per 1,000 teachers) (Indicator 9).
  
  *  Teachers were differentially victimized 
  by violent crimes at school according to 
  where they taught. Over the 5-year period 
  from 1995 through 1999, urban teachers 
  were more likely to be victims of violent 
  crimes than suburban and rural teachers 
  (39 versus 22 and 20, respectively, per 
  1,000 teachers) (Indicator 9).
  
  *  In the 1993-94 school year, 12 percent 
  of all elementary and secondary school 
  teachers were threatened with injury by a 
  student, and 4 percent were physically 
  attacked by a student. This represented 
  about 341,000 teachers who were victims 
  of threats of injury by students that year, 
  and 119,000 teachers who were victims of 
  attacks by students (Indicator 10).
  
  SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT
  
  Between 1995 and 1999, the percentages 
  of students who felt unsafe while they 
  were at school and while they were going 
  to and from school decreased. In 1995, 9 
  percent of students ages 12 through 18 
  sometimes or most of the time feared they 
  were going to be attacked or harmed at 
  school. In 1999, this percentage had fallen 
  to 5 percent. During the same period, the 
  percentage of students fearing they would 
  be attacked while traveling to and from 
  school fell from 7 percent to 4 percent 
  (Indicator 12).
  
  *  Between 1993 and 1999, the percentage 
  of students in grades 9 through 12 who 
  reported carrying a weapon on school 
  property within the previous 30 days fell 
  from 12 percent to 7 percent (about a 42 
  percent reduction) (Indicator 11).
  
  *  Between 1995 and 1999, the percentage 
  of students ages 12 through 18 who avoided 
  one or more places at school for fear of 
  their own safety decreased, from 9 to 5 
  percent. (Indicator 13).
  
  *  In 1999, about 13 percent of students 
  ages 12 through 18 reported that someone 
  at school had used hate-related words 
  against them. That is, in the prior 6 
  months someone at school called them a 
  derogatory word having to do with race/
  ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, 
  or sexual orientation. In addition, about 
  36 percent of students saw hate-related 
  graffiti at school (Indicator 14).
  
  *  Between 1995 and 1999, the percentage 
  of students who reported that street 
  gangs were present at their schools 
  decreased. In 1995, 29 percent of students 
  reported gangs being present in their 
  schools. By 1999, this percentage had 
  fallen to 17 percent (Indicator 15).
  
  *  In 1999, about 5 percent of students 
  in grades 9 through 12 had at least one 
  drink of alcohol on school property in the 
  previous 30 days. Half of students (about 
  50 percent) had at least one drink anywhere 
  during the same period (Indicator 17). 
  
  *  There was an increase in the use of 
  marijuana among students in grades 9 
  through 12 anywhere and on school property 
  between 1993 and 1995, but no change 
  between 1995, 1997, and 1999. About one-
  quarter (27 percent) of students reported 
  using marijuana anywhere in the last 30 
  days in 1999 and 7 percent reported using 
  marijuana on school property 
  (Indicator 18).
  
  *  In 1995, 1997, and 1999, about one-
  third of all students in grades 9 through 
  12 (between 30 and 32 percent) reported 
  that someone had offered, sold, or given 
  them an illegal drug on school property. 
  This was an increase from 1993 when 24 
  percent of such students reported that 
  illegal drugs were available to them on 
  school property (Indicator 19).

  ***Footnote 1: See glossary for definition
  of school-associated violent deaths.*** 
  Thirty-eight of these violent deaths were 
  homicides, six were suicides, two were 
  killed by a law enforcement officer in the 
  line of duty, and one was unintentional.
  
  *  Thirty-three of the 38 school-associated 
  homicides were of school-aged children. 
  There were a total of 2,407 homicides of 
  children ages 5 through 19 occurring from 
  July 1, 1998 through June 30, 1999.
  
  *  Four of the six school-associated 
  suicides occurring between July 1, 1998 
  through June 30, 1999 were of school-aged 
  children. There were a total of 1,854 
  suicides of children ages 5 through 19 
  occurring in the 1999 calendar year.
  
  NONFATAL STUDENT VICTIMIZATION-
  STUDENT REPORTS
  
  Victimization of students at school 
  and away from school**Note: This indicator 
  has been updated to include 1999 data.**
  
  The amount of crime committed in the 
  nation's schools continues to be a concern. 
  Even though crime has decreased in recent 
  years, theft and violence at school and 
  while going to and from school still can 
  lead to disruptive and threatening 
  environments, reducing student performance.
  
  *  Students ages 12 through 18 experienced 
  fewer nonfatal serious violent crimes 
  (that is, rape, sexual assault, robbery, 
  and aggravated assault) when they were at 
  school than away from school.***Footnote 
  2: "Students" refers to persons 12 though 
  18 years of age who have attended any 
  grade equal to or less than high school. 
  An uncertain percentage of these persons 
  may not have attended school during the 
  survey reference period.*** In 1999, 
  students in this age group were victims 
  of about 186,000 such crimes at school, 
  and about 476,000 away from school. The 
  victimization rate for serious violent 
  crime at school and away from school 
  generally declined from 1992 to 1999.
  
  *  Students ages 12 through 18 were 
  victims of about 880,000 nonfatal 
  violent crimes (that is, serious violent 
  crime plus simple assault) at school, 
  and about 1.1 million away from school 
  in 1999. There was a general decline in 
  the violent victimization rate between 
  1992 and 1999 at school as well as away 
  from school (from 48 to 33 and from 71 
  to 39 per 1,000 students ages 12 through 
  18, respectively). For each year from 
  1992 through 1997, the victimization 
  rates for nonfatal violent crime were 
  lower at school than away from school 
  but these rates were similar in 1998 and 
  1999.***Footnote 3: These data do not 
  take into account the number of hours 
  that students spend at school and the 
  number of hours they spend away from 
  school.*** 
  
  *  Students were more likely to be victims 
  of theft at school than away from school 
  for most years between 1992 and 1999. In 
  1999, about 1.6 million thefts occurred at 
  school (64 percent of all crimes at school), 
  and about 1.0 million occurred away from 
  school (50 percent of all crimes away from 
  school). The victimization rate declined 
  for thefts at school between 1992 and 1999 
  as it did for thefts away from school 
  during this period.
  
  *  Considering nonfatal crime (theft plus 
  violent crime), students were victims of 
  about 2.5 million crimes while they were at 
  school in 1999, and about 2.1 million away 
  from school. These represent victimization 
  rates of 92 crimes per 1,000 students at 
  school, and 78 crimes per 1,000 students 
  away from school.
  
  *  In 1999, the rates for serious violent 
  crimes were about the same for males and 
  females at school, but higher for males 
  than females away from school. In the same 
  year, rates of theft were similar for males 
  and females both at school and away from 
  school.
  
  *  In 1999, students living in urban and 
  suburban areas experienced serious violent 
  crime at school at similar rates. Away from 
  school, urban students were more vulnerable 
  to serious violent crime than were suburban 
  students, and suburban students were more 
  likely to experience serious violent 
  victimization than were rural students. 
  However, student vulnerability to theft 
  in 1999 was similar in urban, suburban, 
  and rural areas both at and away from 
  school.
  
  *  Younger students (ages 12 through 14) 
  were victimized at a higher rate than older 
  students (ages 15 through 18) at school. 
  However, older students were more likely 
  than younger students to be victimized away 
  from school.
  
  Prevalence of students being victimized 
  at school**Note: This indicator repeats 
  information  from the 2000 Indicators of 
  School Crime and Safety report.** 
  
  Some of the crimes committed against 
  students involve violence, while others 
  involve their property. Presenting 
  information on the prevalence of 
  victimization for students helps clarify 
  what percentage of students are affected 
  by different types of crime.
  
  *  In 1999, a smaller percentage of 
  students ages 12 through 18 reported 
  being victims of nonfatal crimes 
  (including either theft or violent crimes) 
  at school during the previous 6 months 
  than in 1995 (10 percent and 8 percent, 
  respectively). About 7 percent in 1995 
  were victims of theft compared with 6 
  percent in 1999. Also, 3 percent of 
  students in 1995 reported being victims 
  of violence at school compared with 2 
  percent in 1999.
  
  *  The decline in the prevalence of 
  victimization between 1995 and 1999 was 
  due in part to a decline for students 
  in grades 7 through 9. Between 1995 and 
  1999, the prevalence of reported 
  victimization dropped from 11 percent 
  to 8 percent for 7th graders, from 11 
  percent to 8 percent for 8th graders, 
  and from 12 percent to 9 percent for 9th 
  graders. During the same period, the 
  prevalence of victimization remained 
  relatively constant for 6th, 10th, 11th, 
  and 12th graders.
  
  *  In both 1995 and 1999, public school 
  students were more likely to report 
  having been victims of violent crime 
  during the previous 6 months than were 
  private school students. Public school 
  students were also more likely than private 
  school students to report being victims 
  of theft at school in 1995, but equally 
  likely to experience theft in 1999.
  
  Prevalence of students being 
  threatened or injured with a weapon 
  on school property**Note:  This indicator 
  has been undated to include 1999 data.**
 
  Every year, some students are threatened 
  or injured with a weapon while they are 
  on school property. The percentages of 
  students victimized in this way provide 
  an important measure of how safe our 
  schools are and how this is changing over 
  time.
  
  *  The percentage of students in grades 9 
  through 12 who were threatened or injured 
  with a weapon on school property in the 12 
  months before the survey has remained 
  constant in recent years. In 1993, 1995, 
  1997, and 1999, about 7 to 8 percent of 
  students reported being threatened or 
  injured with a weapon such as a gun, knife, 
  or club on school property. 
  
  *  In each survey year, males were more 
  likely than females to report being 
  threatened or injured with a weapon on 
  school property. For example, in 1999, 10 
  percent of males reported being threatened 
  or injured in the past year, compared with 
  6 percent of females.
  
  *  Of 9th through 12th grade students, those 
  students in lower grades were more likely to 
  be threatened or injured with a weapon on 
  school property than were students in higher 
  grades in all survey years. 
  
 *  There were no racial/ethnic differences 
  in the percentages of students being 
  threatened or injured with a weapon on 
  school property in 1999.*** Footnote 4: While 
  there appear to be large differences among 
  racial/ethnic groups, these differences are 
  associated with large standard errors and 
  are not statistically significant.*** 
  
  Prevalence of students involved in physical 
  fights on school property**Note: This indicator 
  has been unpdated to include 1999 data.**
  
  Schools where there are numerous physical 
  fights may not be able to maintain a 
  focused learning environment. Students who 
  are constantly involved in fights on school 
  property cannot be ready to learn.
  
  
 
  *  In all years, students were more 
  likely to report being in a fight anywhere 
  ***Footnote 5: The term "anywhere" is 
  not used in the YRBS questionnaire. Rather, 
  students are simply asked how many times 
  in the last 12 months they had been in a 
  physical fight.*** than to report being 
  in a fight on school property in the last 
  12 months.  In 1999, 36 percent of students 
  in grades 9 through 12 reported that they 
  had been in a physical fight anywhere. In 
  that same year, about 14 percent of all 
  students said that they had been in a 
  physical fight on school property.
  
  *  The percentage of students who reported 
  being in a fight anywhere declined from 
  1993 to 1999-from 42 percent in 1993 to 36 
  percent in 1999. Similarly, the percentages 
  of students who reported fighting on school 
  property for these years also declined, from 
  16 percent in 1993 to 14 percent in 1999. 
  
  *  In all survey years, males were more 
  likely than females to have been in a fight 
  anywhere and on school property. In 1999, 
  44 percent of males said they had been in 
  a fight anywhere, and 19 percent said they 
  had been in a fight on school property. In 
  that same year, about 27 percent of females 
  reported they had been in a fight anywhere, 
  and 10 percent said they had been in a fight 
  on school property.
  
  *  Of 9th through 12th grade students, 
  those in lower grades reported being in 
  more fights than students in higher grades 
  anywhere and on school property in all 
  survey years. 
  
  *  In 1999, Asian students were less likely 
  than students from other racial/ethnic back-
  grounds to report being in a fight anywhere 
  (23 percent for Asian students compared to 
  33 to 51 percents for all other students). 
  In addition, they were less likely to report 
  being in a fight on school property than 
  black or African American, Native Hawaiian 
  or other Pacific Islander, and Hispanic or 
  Latino students (10 percent compared to 19, 
  25, and 16 percent, respectively).
  
  Prevalence of students being bullied 
  at school**Note: This indicator repeats
  information from the 2000 Indicators
  of School Crime and Safety report.**
  
  Bullying contributes to a climate of 
  fear and intimidation in schools. Students 
  ages 12 through 18 were asked if they had 
  been bullied (that is, picked on or made 
  to do things they did not want to do) at 
  school.
  
  *  In 1999, about 5 percent of students ages 
  12 through 18 reported that they had been 
  bullied at school in the last 6 months. 
  In general, females were as likely as 
  males to report being bullied.
  
  *  Males were more likely to be bullied in 
  grades 6 and 7 than were females (12 percent 
  versus 7 percent respectively), while there 
  was little difference in the percentage of 
  males and females being bullied in the other 
  two grade levels.
  
  *  There were few differences among racial/
  ethnic groups in the percentage of students 
  who reported being bullied. The exception 
  was that white and black students were more 
  likely to report being victimized by bullies 
  than were students of other, non-Hispanic 
  origin. About 2 percent in this group, which 
  includes Asians, Pacific Islanders, American 
  Indians, and Alaskan Natives, reported being 
  bullied, compared with about 5 percent of 
  white and 6 percent of black students.
  
  *  Students in lower grades were more likely 
  to be bullied than students in higher grades. 
  About 10 percent of students in grades 6 and 
  7 reported being bullied, compared with about 
  5 percent of students in grades 8 and 9 and 
  about 2 percent in grades 10 through 12.
  
  VIOLENCE AND CRIME AT SCHOOL--
  PUBLIC SCHOOL PRINCIPAL/DISCIPLINARIAN 
  REPORTS
  
  Crimes reported to the police**Note: This 
  indicator repeats information from the 2000 
  Indicators of School Crime and Safety report.**
  
  The number of crimes that principals 
  indicated they reported to police or 
  other law enforcement representatives 
  is a useful measure of the occurrences 
  of serious crimes in the nation's schools. 
  The percentage of schools reporting crimes 
  provides an indication of how widespread 
  crime is, while the number of crimes 
  reported provides information on the 
  magnitude of the problem.
  
  *  In 1996-97, 10 percent of all public 
  schools reported at least one serious 
  violent crime to a law enforcement 
  representative. Another 47 percent of 
  public schools reported a less serious 
  violent or nonviolent crime (but not a 
  serious violent one). The remaining 43 
  percent of public schools did not report 
  any of these crimes to the police.
  
  *  The vast majority of crimes reported 
  by public schools were of the less serious 
  violent or nonviolent type in 1996-97 
  (402,000 out of the 424,000 total crimes 
  reported to the police).
  
  *  The percentage of schools reporting 
  crimes was similar at the middle and high 
  school levels. At each level, about 20 
  percent of the schools reported at least 
  one serious violent crime, and about 55 
  percent reported at least one less 
  serious violent or nonviolent crime, but 
  no serious violent crime in 1996-97.
  
  *  The numbers of reported incidents per 
  1,000 students were similar for middle and 
  high schools for both serious violent and 
  less serious violent and nonviolent crimes . 
  For both types of crimes, there was a lower 
  rate at the elementary level than at the 
  middle or high school levels. 
  
  *  The percentage of schools reporting at 
  least one serious violent crime was much 
  higher in cities (17 percent) than in towns 
  (5 percent) or rural areas (8 percent) 
  during 1996-97.
  
  Specific crimes reported to the 
  police**Note:  This indicator repeats 
  information from the 2000 Indicators 
  of School Crime and Safety report.**
  
  Data on the prevalence of specific types 
  of crimes add detail to the more general 
  discussion of serious violent crimes and 
  less serious violent and nonviolent crimes. 
  Each type of crime affects students and 
  schools differently.
  
  *  About one-half (44 to 55 percent) of 
  all public middle and high schools 
  reported incidents of vandalism, theft or 
  larceny, and physical attacks or fights 
  without weapons to the police or other 
  law enforcement representatives in the 
  1996-97 school year. Considerably smaller 
  percentages of public middle and high 
  schools reported the more serious violent 
  crimes of rape or other type of sexual 
  battery (5 and 8 percent, respectively); 
  robbery (5 and 8 percent); or physical 
  attack or fight with a weapon (12 and 
  13 percent).
  
  *  Elementary schools were much less likely 
  than either middle or high schools to report 
  any of the types of crime described here in 
  1996-97 . They were much more likely to 
  report vandalism (31 percent) than any other 
  crime (19 percent or less).
  
  *  In 1996-97, physical attack or fight 
  without a weapon was generally the most 
  commonly reported crime at the middle and 
  high school levels (9 and 8 per 1,000 public 
  school students, respectively). Theft or 
  larceny was more common at the high school 
  than the middle school level (6 versus 4 
  per 1,000 students).
  
  *  Overall, there was relatively little 
  variation by urbanicity in the crime rates 
  at school discussed here during the 1996-97 
  school year (as measured by the number of 
  crimes reported per 1,000 public school 
  students) .
  
  
  NONFATAL TEACHER VICTIMIZATION AT SCHOOL--
  TEACHER REPORTS
  
  Nonfatal teacher victimization at 
  school**Note:  This indicator has been 
  updated to include 1999 data.**
 
  Students are not the only ones who are 
  victims of crime at school. Teachers in 
  school can also be the targets of violence 
  and theft. In addition to the personal 
  toll such violence takes on teachers, 
  those who worry about their safety may 
  have difficulty teaching and may leave 
  the profession altogether. Information 
  on the number of crimes against teachers 
  at school can help show how severe and 
  widespread the problem is.
  
  *  Over the 5-year period from 1995 
  through 1999, teachers were the victims 
  of approximately 1,708,000 nonfatal 
  crimes at school, including 1,073,000 
  thefts and 635,000 violent crimes (rape 
  or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated 
  assault, and simple assault). On average, 
  this translates into 342,000 nonfatal 
  crimes per year, or 79 crimes per 1,000 
  teachers per year. Among the violent 
  crimes against teachers during this 5-
  year period, there were about 69,000 
  serious violent crimes (11 percent of 
  the violent crimes), including rape or 
  sexual assault, robbery, and aggravated 
  assault. On average, this translates 
  into 14,000 serious violent crimes per 
  year.
  
  *  During the 1995-99 period, the average 
  annual rate of serious violent crime was 
  similar for teachers (on average, 3 per 
  1,000 teachers), regardless of their 
  instructional level, gender, race/ethnicity, 
  and the urbanicity of the schools where 
  they taught.***Footnote 6: The average 
  annual rate is the sum of all teacher 
  victimizations across five years divided 
  by the sum of all teachers over those five 
  years.***
  
  *  During the 1995-99 period, senior high 
  school and middle/junior high school 
  teachers were more likely to be victims 
  of violent crimes (most of which were 
  simple assaults) than elementary school 
  teachers (38 and 54, respectively, versus 
  16 crimes per 1,000 teachers).
  
  *  During the 1995-99 period, senior high 
  school and middle/junior high school 
  teachers were more likely to experience 
  theft at school than elementary school 
  teachers (61 and 66, respectively, versus 
  38 thefts per 1,000 teachers).
  
  *  The average annual violent crime rate 
  for teachers at school varied by gender. 
  Over the 5-year period from 1995 through 
  1999, male teachers were more likely to be 
  victims of violent crimes than female 
  teachers (51 versus 22 crimes per 1,000 
  teachers). 
  
  *  Teachers were differentially victimized 
  by violent crimes at school according to 
  where they taught. For example, over the 5-
  year period from 1995 through 1999, urban 
  teachers were more likely to be victims of 
  violent crimes than suburban and rural 
  teachers (39 versus 22 and 20, respectively, 
  per 1,000 teachers). Teachers in urban 
  areas were more likely to experience theft 
  at school than those in rural areas (58 
  and 34 respectively, per 1,000 teachers) 
  but no more likely than suburban teachers.
  
  Prevalence of teachers being 
  threatened with injury or attacked 
  by students**Note:  This indicator 
  repeats information from the 2000 
  Indicators of School Crime and Safety 
  report.**
   
  Some of the offenses against teachers are 
  committed by students. Data on physical 
  attacks and threats against elementary and 
  secondary teachers by students can provide 
  a snapshot of the prevalence of this problem.
 
  *  In the 1993-94 school year, 12 percent 
  of all elementary and secondary school 
  teachers (341,000) were threatened with 
  injury by a student from their school, and 
  4 percent (119,000) were physically attacked 
  by a student.
  
  *  Teachers in central city schools were 
  more likely to be victims than were 
  teachers in urban fringe or rural schools 
  in 1993-94. About 15 percent of teachers 
  in central city schools had been threatened 
  with injury by students, compared with 11 
  and 10 percent of teachers in urban fringe 
  and rural schools. About 6 percent of 
  teachers in central city schools had been 
  attacked by students, compared with 4 and 
  3 percent of teachers in urban fringe and 
  rural schools.
  
  *  Public school teachers were more likely 
  than private school teachers to be victi-
  mized by students in school in 1993-94. 
  Almost 13 percent of public school teachers 
  had been threatened with injury by students, 
  compared with 4 percent of private school 
  teachers, and 4 percent of public school 
  teachers had been physically attacked by 
  students, compared with 2 percent of 
  private school teachers. Teachers in public 
  central city schools were about five times 
  more likely to be targets of threats of 
  injury and about three times more likely 
  to be targets of attacks than their 
  colleagues in private central city schools.
  
  *  In 1993-94, secondary school teachers 
  were more likely than elementary school 
  teachers to have been threatened with 
  injury by a student from their school (15 
  percent versus 9 percent). However, 
  elementary school teachers were more 
  likely than secondary school teachers 
  to have been physically attacked by a 
  student (5 percent versus 3 percent). 
  The prevalence of teacher victimization 
  by students did not vary according to the 
  racial/ethnic backgrounds of teachers.
  
  SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT
  
  Prevalence of students carrying weapons 
  on school property**Note: This indicator
  has been uupdated to include 1999 data.**
  
  The presence of weapons at school can 
  create an intimidating and threatening 
  atmosphere, making teaching and learning 
  difficult. The percentages of students 
  who report that they carry a gun or 
  other weapon on school property is an 
  indicator of the breadth of the problem 
  of weapons at school.
  
  * In every survey year, more students 
  reported carrying a weapon anywhere 
  ***Footnote 7: This indicator repeats 
  information from the 2000 Indicators 
  of School Crime and Safety report.***
  than reported carrying a weapon on school 
  property in the past 30 days. In 1999, 
  17 percent of students in grades 9 
  through 12 reported carrying a weapon 
  such as a gun, knife, or club anywhere. 
  About 7 percent reported they had carried 
  a weapon on school property. 
  
  *  Between 1993 and 1999, the percentage 
  of students who reported carrying a 
  weapon anywhere fell from 22 percent to 
  17 percent. There was also a decline in 
  the percentage of students who carried 
  a weapon at school-from 12 percent in 
  1993 to 7 percent in 1999 (about a 42 
  percent reduction). 
  
  *  In all years, males were approximately 
  between four and five times more likely 
  than females to carry a weapon anywhere 
  and between three and four times more 
  likely to carry a weapon on school property. 
  For example, in 1999, 11 percent of 
  males carried a weapon on school property, 
  compared with 3 percent of females. 
  
  *  Students in lower grades were generally 
  more likely to have carried a weapon 
  anywhere than were students in higher 
  grades in all survey years except 1999. 
  However, at school, students in all 
  grades were equally likely to carry 
  a weapon in all survey years, except 
  1995.
  
  *  There were few racial/ethnic 
  differences in the percentages of 
  students carrying weapons 
  anywhere and on school property.
  ***Footnote 8: While there appear to 
  be large differences among racial/ethnic 
  groups, these differences are associated 
  with large standard errors and are not 
  statistically significant.***
  
  Students' perceptions of personal 
  safety at school and when traveling 
  to and from school**Note:  This indicator 
  repeats information from the 2000 
  Indicators of School Crime and Safety 
  report. Comparisons between the 1989 
  data and the 1995 and 1999 data should
  be made with caution due to changes in 
  the questionnaire. See appendix B for 
  details.**
   
  One consequence of school violence is the 
  fear that it can instill in students. 
  Students who fear for their own safety 
  may not be able or ready to learn. Concerns 
  about vulnerability to attacks by others at 
  school and on the way to and from school may 
  also have a detrimental effect on the school 
  environment and learning.
                      
  *  Between 1995 and 1999, there were decreases 
  in the percentages of students feeling unsafe 
  while they were at school and while they were 
  going to and from school. In 1995, 9 percent 
  of students ages 12 through 18 sometimes or 
  most of the time feared they were going to be 
  attacked or harmed at school, while in 1999 
  this percentage fell to 5 percent. Between 
  these years, the percentage of students fearing 
  they would be attacked while traveling to and
  from school fell from 7 percent to 4 percent.
  
  *  Between 1995 and 1999, there was a decline 
  in fear of attacks at school and when traveling 
  to and from school among all racial/ethnic groups. 
  However, in both years, larger percentages of 
  black and Hispanic students than white students 
  feared such attacks.
  
  *  In both 1995 and 1999, students in lower 
  grades were more likely to fear for their safety 
  at school than were students in higher grades. 
  For example, in 1999, 9 percent of students in 
  grade 6 feared for their safety while at school, 
  compared with 3 percent of students in grade 12.
  
  *  Between 1995 and 1999 there was a decline 
  in fear of attacks at school and to and from 
  school within almost all grades. However, in 
  both 1995 and 1999, students in lower grades 
  were also more likely than students in higher 
  grades to fear being attacked on the way to 
  and from school.
  
  *  Between 1995 and 1999 there was a decline in 
  fear of attacks at school and to and from school 
  for students in all areas-urban, suburban and 
  rural. However, in 1999, as in 1995, students in 
  urban schools were more likely than students in 
  suburban or rural schools to fear being attacked 
  at school and when travelling to and from school.
  
  Students' reports of avoiding places 
  in school**Note:  This indicator repeats 
  information from the 2000 Indicators of 
  School Crime and Safety report. Comparisons 
  between the 1989 data and the 1995 and 
  1999 data should be made with caution due 
  to changes in the questionnaire.  See 
  appendix B for details.**
   
  One consequence of crime in school is that 
  students begin to perceive specific areas in 
  school as unsafe. In trying to ensure their 
  own safety, they begin to avoid these areas. 
  Changes in the percentage of students avoiding
  areas in school may be a good barometer of 
  how safe schools are--at least in the minds 
  of those who attend these schools.
  
  *  Between 1995 and 1999, there was a decrease 
  in the percentage of students ages 12 through 
  18 who avoided one or more places in school-
  from 9 percent in 1995 to 5 percent in 1999. 
  Despite this decline, this percentage still 
  represented 1.1 million students in 1999 who 
  reported avoiding some areas in school out of 
  fear for their own safety.
  
  *  The percentage of students of all racial/
  ethnic groups avoiding specific areas in 
  school fell between 1995 and 1999. In both 1995 
  and 1999, black and Hispanic students were more 
  likely to avoid areas in school than were white 
  students.
  
  *  Between 1995 and 1999, there was a decrease 
  in the percentage of students reporting avoiding 
  areas in school among students of almost all grade 
  levels.  However, in both years, students in 
  lower grades were more likely than students 
  in higher grades to report avoiding areas in 
  school.
  
  *  While in 1995, students in urban areas were 
  more likely than suburban students to avoid 
  areas in school (12 percent versus 8 percent, 
  respectively), by 1999 urban and suburban 
  students were equally as likely to avoid areas 
  in school.
  
  Students' reports of being called hate-
  related words and seeing hate-related 
  graffiti**Note:  This indicator repeats 
  information from the 2000 Indicators of 
  School Crime and Safety report.**
  
  A student's exposure to hate-related words or 
  symbols at school can increase his or her 
  feeling of vulnerability.  An environment in 
  which students are confronted with discriminatory 
  behavior is not conducive to learning and
  creates a climate of hostility.
   
  *  In 1999, about 13 percent of students ages 
  12 through 18 reported that someone at school 
  had used hate-related words against them. That 
  is, in the prior 6 months someone at school 
  called them a derogatory word having to do with 
  race/ethnicity, religion, disability, gender, 
  or sexual orientation. In addition, about 36 
  percent of students saw hate-related graffiti 
  at school.
  
  *  There was very little variation in these 
  percentages based on the location of the 
  students' households. Students in urban, 
  suburban, and rural households were equally as 
  likely to report being called hate-related 
  words and to see hate-related graffiti.
  
  *  Females were more likely than males to 
  report being targets of derogatory words and 
  were also more likely to report seeing hate-
  related graffiti at their school.  About 14 
  percent of females reported being called hate 
  words in 1999, compared with 12 percent of 
  males. About 39 percent of females had seen
  hate-related graffiti, compared with 34 
  percent of males.
  
  *  Black students were more likely than white 
  or Hispanic students to report being called 
  hate words.  About 17 percent of black students 
  ages 12 through 18 reported being targets of 
  derogatory words, compared with 13 percent of 
  white students and 12 percent of Hispanic
  students.***Footnote 9: The percentage of other, 
  non-Hispanic students who were victimized by 
  hate-related words was similar to that
  for white, non-Hispanic, black, non-Hispanic, 
  and Hispanic students.  Students of all racial/
  ethnic groups were equally likely to report 
  hate-related graffiti at school.
  
  Students' reports of gangs at 
  school**Note:  This indicator repeats 
  information from the 2000 Indicators of 
  School Crime and Safety report.  Comparisons 
  between the 1989 data and the 1995 and 1999 
  data should be made with caution due to 
  changes in the questionnaire.  See appendix 
  B for details.**
  
  Street gangs are organized groups that are 
  often involved in drugs, weapons trafficking, 
  and violence. The presence of street gangs in 
  school can be very disruptive to the school 
  environment. Street gangs may not only create 
  fear among students but also increase the level 
  of violence in school. The percentage of 
  students who report the presence of street gangs 
  in their schools indicates the existence and 
  severity of the gang problem in schools.
  
  *  Between 1995 and 1999, the percentage of 
  students who reported that street gangs were 
  present at their schools decreased. In 1995, 29 
  percent of students reported street gangs being 
  present in their schools. By 1999, this 
  percentage had fallen to 17 percent.
  
  *  Gangs were more likely to be reported in 
  public schools than in private schools. In
  1999, 19 percent of students in public schools 
  reported that street gangs were present in their 
  schools, compared with 4 percent in private 
  schools. A similar pattern of results was reported 
  in 1995. However, between these two years, the 
  percentage of public school students reporting
  that gangs were present in their schools decreased 
  by about 40 percent (from 31 percent in 1995 to 
  19 percent in 1999) as did the percentage of private 
  school students reporting gang presence 
  (from 7 percent to 4 percent).
  
  *  In 1999, urban students were more likely to 
  report that there were street gangs at their 
  schools (25 percent) than were suburban and rural 
  students (16 percent and 11 percent, respectively).
  Between 1995 and 1999, reports of gang presence 
  decreased regardless of students' place of 
  residence.
  
  *  In both years, Hispanic and black students were 
  more likely than white students to report the 
  existence of street gangs in their schools. In 1995, 
  Hispanic students were more likely than black students 
  to do so, while in 1999 they were equally as likely. 
  Between 1995 and 1999, reports of gang presence
  decreased for whites, blacks, Hispanics, and students 
  of other race/ethnicities.
  
  Public school principals' reports 
  of discipline problems at 
  school**Note:  This indicator repeats 
  information from the 2000 Indicators 
  of School Crime and Safety report.**
  
  Discipline problems in a school may contribute to 
  an overall climate in which violence may occur. 
  Schools that suffer from student drug or alcohol 
  use, racial tensions, or verbal and physical abuse 
  of teachers may be filled with pressures that result 
  in school violence.
  
  *  During the 1996-97 school year, 16 percent of 
  all public school principals reported that one 
  or more discipline issues had been a serious 
  problem in their school.***Footnote l0:  These 
  issues were student tardiness, student 
  absenteeism/class cutting, physical conflicts 
  among students, robbery or theft of items worth 
  over $10, vandalism of school property, student 
  alcohol use, student drug use, sale of drugs on 
  school grounds, student tobacco use, student 
  possession of weapons, trespassing, verbal abuse 
  of teachers, physical abuse of teachers, teacher 
  absenteeism, teacher alcohol or drug use, racial 
  tensions, and gangs.***  About the same percentage 
  of principals in city, urban fringe, town, and
  rural settings reported one or more serious 
  discipline problems.
  
  *  Public elementary schools were the least likely
  to report any serious discipline issues, followed 
  by middle schools and then high schools. About 
  8 percent of elementary school principals
  reported one or more of these issues as a serious
  problem, while 18 percent of principals in middle 
  schools and 37 percent of those in high schools 
  did so.
  
  *  While overall there were no significant 
  differences in reported serious problems by 
  urbanicity, a greater percentage of principals 
  in public city high schools than in rural high 
  schools reported having serious discipline
  problems -- 47 percent compared with 28 percent.
  Prevalence of students using 
  alcohol**Note: This indicator has been
  updated to include 1999 data.**
  
  The consumption of alcohol by students on school
  property, a crime in itself, may also lead to 
  other crimes and misbehavior. It can lead to a 
  school environment that is harmful to students, 
  teachers, and staff.
  
  *  In 1999, 50 percent of students in grades 9 
  through 12 had at least one drink of alcohol 
  anywhere ***Footnote 11:  The term "anywhere" 
  is not used in the YRBS questionnaire. Rather, 
  students are simply asked during the past 30 
  days, on how many days did they have at least 
  one drink of alcohol.*** in the 30 days before 
  being surveyed.  A much smaller percentage 
  (5 percent) had at least one drink on school 
  property during the same period. 
  
  *  Approximately the same percentage of students 
  had consumed alcohol in 1999 as in 1993, 1995, 
  and 1997-both anywhere and on school property. 
  
  *  In every survey year except for 1995, males 
  were more likely than females to have used alcohol 
  anywhere. Furthermore, in every survey year,
  males were more likely than females to use 
  alcohol on school property. For example, in 1999, 
  6 percent of males had used alcohol on school 
  property compared with 4 percent of females.
  
  *  In every survey year, students in higher grades 
  were more likely to report drinking alcohol 
  anywhere than were students in lower grades.
  However, in every survey year, students in all 
  grades were equally likely to report drinking 
  alcohol on school property. 
  
  *  Asian students were less likely to use alcohol 
  anywhere than students of any other racial/ethnic 
  background in 1999 (26 percent for Asian students 
  compared to 40 to 61 percent for all other students). 
  They also were less likely to report using alcohol 
  on school property than black or African American, 
  white, and Hispanic or Latino students (2 percent 
  compared to 4, 5, and 7 percent, respectively).
  
  Prevalence of students using 
  marijuana**Note: This indicator has been 
  updated to include 1999 data.** 
  
  The use of drugs at school may cause disruptions 
  in the learning environment. The consumption of 
  these substances, such as marijuana, can lead to 
  a school environment that is harmful to students, 
  teachers, and school administrators.
  
  *  In all years, a greater number of students in 
  grades 9 through 12 reported using marijuana 
  anywhere***Footnote 12:  The term "anywhere" is not 
  used in the YRBS questionnaire. Rather, students 
  are simply asked how many times during the past 30 
  days they used marijuana.*** than reported using 
  marijuana on school property during the last 30 
  days. In 1999, 27 percent of students reported using 
  marijuana anywhere whereas 7 percent of students 
  reported using marijuana on school property. 
  
  *  There was an increase in students' use of 
  marijuana anywhere and on school property between 
  1993 and 1995.  In both 1997 and 1999, the
  percentage of students using marijuana anywhere and 
  on school property were similar to the percentage 
  in 1995. 
  
  *  Males were more likely than females to have used
  marijuana in every survey year both anywhere and on
  school property. 
  
  *  In 1993, 1995, and 1999, students in lower grades 
  were generally less likely than students in higher 
  grades to report using marijuana anywhere. In 1997, 
  this difference was not apparent, with students in 
  lower grades about as likely to report using
  marijuana anywhere as students in higher grades.
  Students' grade in school was not associated with 
  their use of marijuana on school property. 
  
  *  In 1999, Asian students were less likely than 
  students from other racial/ethnic backgrounds to 
  report using marijuana anywhere. However, 
  regarding marijuana use at school, there were 
  generally no differences across racial/ethnic 
  groups.
  
  Prevalence of students reporting drugs 
  were made available to them on school 
  property**Note:  This indicator has been 
  updated to include 1999 data.**
  
  Schools can be places where young people are 
  offered or can purchase illegal drugs. The 
  availability of drugs on school property is a 
  disruptive and corrupting influence in the 
  school environment.
 
  * In 1995, 1997, and 1999, between 30 and 32 
  percent of all students in grades 9 through 12 
  reported that someone had offered, sold, or given 
  them an illegal drug on school property in the 
  12 months prior to the survey. This was an 
  increase from 1993 when 24 percent of such students 
  reported that illegal drugs were available to 
  them on school property. 
  
  *  In each survey year, males were more likely 
  than females to report that drugs were offered, 
  sold, or given to them on school property.  For 
  example, in 1999, 35 percent of males reported 
  the availability of drugs, while 26 percent of 
  females did so. 
  
  *  Students' grade level in school did not appear 
  to be associated with whether they had been offered, 
  sold, or given drugs on school property. Generally,
  in each survey year, about the same percentage of
  students in each grade level reported the 
  availability of illegal drugs.
  
  *  In 1999, the racial/ethnic background of students 
  was associated with their reports of having illegal 
  drugs offered, sold, or given to them on school 
  property.  Specifically, Hispanic or Latino and 
  Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander students 
  were more likely than black or African American,
  white, and Asian students to report having drugs
  available to them on school property.
  
  APPENDIX A. SCHOOL PRACTICES AND 
  POLICIES RELATED TO SAFETY AND 
  DISCIPLINE**Note:  This appendix repeats 
  information from the 2000 Indicators of 
  School Crime and Safety report.**
  
  Concern over school crime and violence has 
  prompted many public schools to take various 
  measures to reduce and prevent violence and 
  ensure safety in schools. Such measures 
  include adopting zero tolerance policies; 
  requiring students to wear uniforms; 
  employing various security measures such as 
  requiring visitor sign-in and using metal 
  detectors; having police or other law 
  enforcement representatives stationed at 
  the school; and offering students various 
  types of violence prevention programs. 
  Presented in this appendix are data on the 
  implementation of such safety measures in 
  public schools. This report does not 
  evaluate the effectiveness of any of these 
  efforts or strategies, and the inclusion 
  of a strategy does not suggest that it is 
  endorsed by the National Center for 
  Education Statistics (NCES) or the Bureau 
  of Justice Statistics (BJS) as an effective 
  means of reducing or preventing violence. 
  Likewise, the omission of a possible strategy 
  does not suggest it is rejected by NCES or 
  BJS as a policy to reduce or prevent violence. 
  This information, along with supporting 
  tables, was drawn from a recent NCES report 
  titled Violence and Discipline Problems in 
  U.S. Public Schools: 1996-97 (NCES 98-030). 
  The report was based on data from the 1996-97 
  Fast Response Survey System (FRSS) Principal/
  School Disciplinarian Survey on School 
  Violence. Readers should consult that report 
  for more detailed findings on variation by 
  school characteristics.
  
  Zero Tolerance Policies
  
  *  Most public schools reported having zero 
  tolerance policies toward serious student 
  offenses. A "zero tolerance policy" was 
  defined as a school or district policy that 
  mandates predetermined consequences or 
  punishments for specific offenses. At least 9 
  out of 10 schools reported zero tolerance 
  policies for firearms (94 percent) and 
  weapons other than firearms (91 percent). 
  Eighty-seven percent of schools had policies 
  of zero tolerance for alcohol and 88 percent 
  had zero tolerance policies for drugs. Most 
  schools also had zero tolerance policies 
  for violence and tobacco (79 percent each).
  
  School Uniforms
  
  *  Requiring students to wear school uniforms 
  was not common. Three percent of all public 
  schools required students to wear uniforms 
  during the 1996-97 school year. 
  
  Security Measures
  
  *  Schools took a number of measures to 
  secure their schools. For example, 96 percent 
  of public schools reported that visitors 
  were required to sign in before entering 
  the school building; 80 percent of public 
  schools reported having a closed campus 
  policy that prohibited most students from 
  leaving the campus for lunch; 53 percent 
  of public schools controlled access to their 
  school building; and 24 percent of public 
  schools controlled access to their school 
  grounds. In addition, 19 percent of public 
  schools reported conducting drug sweeps, 
  with middle schools and high schools being 
  more likely to use drug sweeps than elementary 
  schools (36 and 45 percent, respectively, 
  versus 5 percent). While 4 percent of public 
  schools reported that they performed random 
  metal detector checks on students, daily use 
  of metal detectors as a security measure was 
  not common: only 1 percent of public schools 
  reported taking this measure.
  
  Presence of Police or Other Law Enforcement
  Representatives in Schools
  
  *  In addition to the security measures 
  described above, 6 percent of public schools 
  reported having police or other law enforcement
  representatives stationed 30 hours or more 
  at the school in a typical week during the 
  1996-97 school year; 1 percent of schools 
  had them stationed from 10 to 29 hours; and 
  3 percent had them stationed from 1 to 9 hours. 
  Twelve percent of schools did not have police 
  or other law enforcement representatives 
  stationed during a typical week but made 
  them available as needed, and 78 percent 
  of schools did not have any such persons 
  stationed at their schools.
  
  Violence Prevention or Reduction 
  Programs
  
  *  A majority of public schools (78 percent) 
  reported having some type of formal school 
  violence prevention or reduction program. The 
  percentage of schools with both 1-day and 
  ongoing programs (43 percent) was higher than 
  schools with only ongoing programs (24 
  percent) and schools with only 1-day programs 
  (11 percent).
  
  Policies to Prevent Firearms 
  in School
  
  *  In the 1996-97 school year, there were over 
  5,000 student expulsions for possession or use 
  of a firearm.  An additional 3,300 students 
  were transferred to alternative schools for 
  possession or use of a firearm, while 8,144 
  were placed in out-of-school suspensions 
  lasting 5 or more days. About 5 percent of 
  all public schools (or 4,170) took one or 
  more of these actions.
  
  APPENDIX B. TECHNICAL NOTES
  
  General Information
  
  The information presented in this report was 
  obtained from many data sources, including 
  databases from the National Center for Education 
  Statistics (NCES), the Centers for Disease 
  Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Bureau 
  of Justice Statistics (BJS). While some of 
  the data were collected from universe surveys, 
  most were gathered by sample surveys. Some 
  questions from different surveys may appear 
  the same, but they were actually asked of 
  different populations of students (e.g., 
  high school seniors or students in grades 9 
  through 12); in different years; about 
  experiences that occurred within different 
  periods of time (e.g., in the past 4 weeks or 
  during the past 12 months); and at different 
  locations (e.g., in school or at home). Readers 
  of this report should take particular care 
  when comparing data from the different data 
  sources. Because of the variation in collection 
  procedures, timing, phrasing of questions, 
  and so forth, the results from the different 
  sources may not be strictly comparable. 
  After introducing the data sources used for 
  this report, the next section discusses the 
  accuracy of estimates and describes the 
  statistical procedures used.
  
  Sources of Data
  
  Table B1 presents some key information for 
  each of the data sets used in the report, 
  including the survey year(s), target population, 
  response rate, and sample size. The remainder 
  of the section briefly describes each data set 
  and provides directions for obtaining more 
  information. The exact wording of the interview 
  questions used to construct the indicators are 
  presented in table B2.
  
  Schools and Staffing Survey 
  (SASS)
  
  This report draws upon data on teacher 
  victimization from the 1993-94 Schools 
  and Staffing Survey (SASS:93-94), which 
  provides national- and state-level data 
  on public and private schools, principals, 
  school districts, and teachers. The 1993-
  94 survey was the third in a series of 
  cross-sectional, school-focused surveys, 
  following ones conducted in 1990-91 and 
  1987-88. It consisted of four sets of 
  linked questionnaires, including surveys 
  of schools, the principals of each selected 
  school, a subsample of teachers within each 
  school, and public school districts. Data 
  were collected by multistage sampling. 
  Stratified by state, control, type, 
  association membership, and grade level 
  (for private schools), schools were sampled 
  first. Approximately 9,900 public schools 
  and 3,300 private schools were selected to 
  participate in the 1993-94 SASS. Within 
  each school, teachers were further stratified 
  into one of five teacher types in the 
  following hierarchy: 1) Asian or Pacific 
  Islander; 2) American Indian, Aleut, or 
  Eskimo; 3) bilingual/ESL; 4) new teachers 
  (those with 1 to 3 years of experience); and 
  5) experienced teachers (those with more 
  than 3 years of experience). Within each 
  teacher stratum, teachers were selected 
  systematically with equal probability. 
  Approximately 56,700 public school teachers 
  and 11,500 private school teachers were sampled.
  
  This report focuses on teachers' responses. 
  The overall weighted response rates were 84 
  percent for public school teachers and 73 
  percent for private school teachers. In the 
  Public School Teacher Questionnaire, 91 
  percent of the items had a response rate of 
  90 percent or more, and in the Private School 
  Teacher Questionnaire, 89 percent of the 
  items had this level of response. Values were 
  imputed for questionnaire items that should 
  have been answered but were not. For additional 
  information about SASS, refer to R. Abramson,

  National School-Based Youth Risk Behavior 
  Survey (YRBS)
  
  The National School-Based Youth Risk 
  Behavior Survey (YRBS) is one component 
  of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance 
  System (YRBSS), an epidemiological 
  surveillance system developed by the 
  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
  (CDC) to monitor the prevalence of youth 
  behaviors that most influence health. The 
  YRBS focuses on priority health-risk 
  behaviors established during youth that 
  result in the most significant mortality, 
  morbidity, disability, and social problems 
  during both youth and adulthood. This report 
  uses 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999 YRBS data.
  
  The YRBS used a three-stage cluster sampling 
  design to produce a nationally representative 
  sample of students in grades 9 through 12 in 
  the United States. The target population 
  consisted of all public and private school 
  students in grades 9 through 12 in the 50 
  states and the District of Columbia. The 
  first-stage sampling frame included 
  selecting primary sampling units (PSUs) 
  from strata formed on the basis of 
  urbanization and the relative percentage 
  of black and Hispanic students in the 
  PSU. These PSUs are either large counties 
  or groups of smaller, adjacent counties. 
  At the second stage, schools were selected 
  with probability proportional to school 
  enrollment size. Schools with substantial 
  numbers of black and Hispanic students were 
  sampled at relatively higher rates than all 
  other schools. The final stage of sampling 
  consisted of randomly selecting within each 
  chosen school at each grade 9 through 12 one 
  or two intact classes of a required subject, 
  such as English or social studies. All 
  students in selected classes were eligible to 
  participate. Approximately 16,300, 10,900, 
  16,300, and 15,300 students were selected to 
  participate in the 1993, 1995, 1997, and 1999 
  surveys, respectively.
  
  The overall response rate was 70 percent for 
  the 1993 survey, 60 percent for the 1995 survey, 
  69 percent for the 1997 survey, and 66 percent 
  for the 1999 survey. NCES standards call for 
  response rates of 70 percent or better and 
  bias analyses are called for by NCES when that 
  percentage is not achieved. For the YRBS data, 
  a full nonresponse bias analysis has not been 
  done to date. The weights were developed to 
  adjust for nonresponse and the oversampling of 
  black and Hispanic students in the sample. The 
  final weights were normalized so that only 
  weighted proportions of students (not weighted 
  counts of students) in each grade matched national 
  population projections. 
  
  In 1999, in accordance with changes to the Office 
  of Management and Budget's standards for the 
  classification of federal data on race and ethnicity, 
  the YRBS item on race/ethnicity was modified. The 
  version of the race and ethnicity question used in 
  1993, 1995, and 1997 was: 
  
  How do you describe yourself?

  This new version of the question used in 1999 
  results in the possibility of respondents 
  marking more than one category. While more 
  accurately reflecting respondents' racial and 
  ethnic identity, the new item cannot be 
  directly compared to responses to the old 
  item. Thus, comparisons of responses by race/
  ethnicity between the 1999 YRBS and prior 
  years' YRBS are not advisable. For additional

  Fast Response Survey System: Principal/School 
  Disciplinarian Survey on School Violence
  
  The Principal/School Disciplinarian Survey 
  was conducted through the NCES Fast Response 
  Survey System (FRSS) during the spring and 
  summer of 1997. The FRSS is a survey system 
  designed to collect small amounts of issue-
  oriented data with minimal burden on respondents 
  and within a relatively short time frame. 
  The FRSS Principal/School Disciplinarian 
  Survey focused on incidents of specific 
  crimes/offenses and a variety of specific 
  discipline issues in public schools. The 
  survey was conducted with a nationally 
  representative sample of regular public 
  elementary, middle, and high schools in the 
  50 states and the District of Columbia. 
  Special education, alternative and 
  vocational schools, schools in the territories, 
  and schools that taught only prekindergarten, 
  kindergarten, or adult education were not 
  included in the sample.
  
  The sample of public schools was selected 
  from the 1993-94 NCES Common Core of Data 
  (CCD) Public School Universe File. The sample 
  was stratified by instructional level, locale, 
  and school size. Within the primary strata, 
  schools were also sorted by geographic region 
  and by percent minority enrollment. The sample 
  sizes were then allocated to the primary strata 
  in rough proportion to the aggregate square 
  root of the size of enrollment of schools in 
  the stratum. A total of 1,415 schools were 
  selected. Among them, 11 schools were found no 
  longer to be in existence, and 1,234 schools 
  completed the survey. In April 1997, 
  questionnaires were mailed to school principals, 
  who were asked to complete the survey or to 
  have it completed by the person most 
  knowledgeable about discipline issues at 
  the school. The raw response rate was 88 
  percent (1,234 schools divided by the 1,404 
  eligible schools in the sample). The weighted 
  overall response rate was 89 percent, and 
  item nonresponse rates ranged from 0 percent 
  to 0.9 percent. The weights were developed 
  to adjust for the variable probabilities of 
  selection and differential nonresponse and can 
  be used to produce national estimates for 
  regular public schools in the 1996-97 school 
  year. For more information about the FRSS:

  National Crime Victimization Survey 
  (NCVS)
  
  The National Crime Victimization Survey 
  (NCVS), administered for the U.S. Bureau of 
  Justice Statistics by the Census Bureau, is 
  the nation's primary source of information 
  on crime victimization and the victims 
  of crime. Initiated in 1972 and redesigned 
  in 1992, the NCVS collects detailed 
  information on the frequency and nature of 
  the crimes of rape, sexual assault, robbery, 
  aggravated and simple assault, theft, 
  household burglary, and motor vehicle theft 
  experienced by Americans and their households 
  each year. The survey measures crimes 
  reported as well as those not reported to 
  police.
  
  The NCVS sample consists of about 50,000 
  households selected using a stratified, 
  multistage cluster design. In the first stage, 
  the primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting 
  of counties or groups of counties, were 
  selected. In the second stage, smaller areas, 
  called Enumeration Districts (EDs), were 
  selected from each sampled PSU. Finally, from 
  selected EDs, clusters of four households, 
  called segments, were selected for interview. 
  At each stage, the selection was done 
  proportionate to population size in order to 
  create a self-weighting sample. The final 
  sample was augmented to account for housing 
  units constructed after the decennial Census. 
  Within each sampled household, Census Bureau 
  personnel interviewed all household members 
  ages 12 and older to determine whether they 
  had been victimized by the measured crimes 
  during the 6 months preceding the interview. 
  About 90,000 persons ages 12 and older are 
  interviewed each 6 months. Households remain 
  in the sample for 3 years and are interviewed 
  7 times at 6-month intervals. The initial 
  interview at each sample unit is used only to 
  bound future interviews to establish a time 
  frame to avoid duplication of crimes uncovered 
  in these subsequent interviews. After their 
  seventh interview, households are replaced by 
  new sample households. The NCVS has 
  consistently obtained a response rate of about 
  95 percent at the household level. During the 
  study period, the completion rates for persons 
  within households were about 91 percent. Thus, 
  final response rates were about 86 percent. 
  Weights were developed to permit estimates for 
  the total U.S. population 12 years and older.

  School Crime Supplement 
  (SCS)
  
  Created as a supplement to the NCVS and 
  co-designed by the National Center for 
  Education Statistics and Bureau of Justice 
  Statistics, the School Crime Supplement 
  (SCS) survey was conducted in 1989, 1995, 
  and 1999 to collect additional information 
  about school-related victimizations on a 
  national level. The survey was designed to 
  assist policymakers as well as academic 
  researchers and practitioners at the federal, 
  state, and local levels so that they can 
  make informed decisions concerning crime in 
  schools. The SCS asks students a number of 
  key questions about their experiences with 
  and perceptions of crime and violence that 
  occurred inside their school, on school grounds, 
  or on the way to or from school. Additional 
  questions not included in the NCVS were also 
  added to the SCS, such as those concerning 
  preventive measures used by the school, 
  students' participation in afterschool activities, 
  students' perceptions of school rules, the 
  presence of weapons and street gangs in 
  school, the presence of hate-related words 
  and graffiti in school, student reports of 
  bullying at school, and the availability of 
  drugs and alcohol in school, as well as 
  attitudinal questions relating to fear of 
  victimization and avoidance behavior in school.
  
  In 1989, 1995, and 1999, the SCS was 
  conducted for a 6-month period from January 
  through June in all households selected for 
  the NCVS (see discussion above for information 
  about the sampling design). It should be noted 
  that the initial NCVS interview is included 
  in the SCS data analysis. Within these 
  households, the eligible respondents for the 
  SCS were those household members who had 
  attended school at any time during the 6 
  months preceding the interview, and were 
  enrolled in grades 6 through 12 in a school 
  that would help them advance toward eventually 
  receiving a high school diploma. Eligible 
  respondents were asked the supplemental 
  questions in the SCS only after completing 
  their entire NCVS interview. For the 1989 
  and the 1995 SCS, 19-year-old household 
  members also were considered eligible for 
  the SCS interview. This upper age range was 
  lowered to 18 for eligibility in the 1999 
  SCS because it was determined that most 
  19-year-olds did not meet the other 
  eligibility requirement of being currently 
  enrolled in a secondary school. In this 
  report, 19-year-olds were excluded from the 
  analysis of the 1995 data in order to meet 
  the eligibility requirements and to allow 
  for comparisons to the 1999 SCS. However, 
  the 19-year-olds were not dropped from the 
  analysis of the 1989 data. 
  
  Comparisons between the 1989 data and the 
  1995 and 1999 data should be made with 
  caution due to the redesign of the NCVS in 
  1992. A new victimization screening procedure, 
  put in place in 1992, was meant to elicit a 
  more complete tally of victimization 
  incidents than did the one used in prior 
  NCVS collections. Therefore, NCVS item-based 
  cross-year changes in reported victimization 
  rates, or lack thereof, may only be the 
  result of changes in how the questions were 
  asked and not of actual changes in the 
  incidence of victimization. Because NCVS 
  questionnaires were completed before students 
  were given the SCS, it is likely that these 
  changes to the NCVS victimization screening 
  procedures differentially affected responses 
  to the 1989 and 1995 SCS victimization items. 
  Other items in this report, such as fear at 
  school, avoidance of places at school, and 
  reports of gangs at school, followed the 
  victimization items on the SCS survey. 
  
  Unlike prior Indicators reports, the 
  prevalence of victimization for 1995 
  and 1999 was calculated by using NCVS 
  incident variables appended to the 1995 
  and 1999 SCS data files. The NCVS type 
  of crime variable was used to classify 
  victimizations of students in the SCS as 
  serious violent, violent, or theft. The 
  NCVS variables asking where the incident 
  happened and what the victim was doing 
  when it happened were used to ascertain 
  whether the incident happened at school. 
  For prevalence of victimization, the NCVS 
  definition of "at school" includes in the 
  school building, on school property, or 
  on the way to or from school. 
  
  Total victimization is a combination of 
  violent victimization and theft. If the 
  student reported an incident of either, he 
  or she is counted as having experienced 
  "total" victimization. If the student 
  reported having experienced both, he or she 
  is counted once under "total" victimization. 
  Serious violent crimes include rape, sexual 
  assault, robbery, and aggravated assault. 
  Violent crimes include serious violent crimes 
  and simple assault. 
  
  A total of 10,449 students participated in 
  the 1989 SCS, 9,728 in the 1995 SCS, and 
  8,398 in 1999. In the 1999 SCS, the household 
  completion rate was 94 percent. In the 1989 
  and 1995 SCS, the household completion rates 
  were 97 percent and 95 percent, respectively; 
  and the student completion rates were 86 
  percent and 78 percent, respectively. For the 
  1999 SCS, the student completion rate was 78 
  percent. Thus, the overall SCS response rate 
  (calculated by multiplying the household 
  completion rate by the student completion 
  rate) was 84 percent in 1989, 74 percent in 
  1995, and 73 percent in 1999. Response rates 
  for most survey items were high-mostly over 
  95 percent of all eligible respondents. The 
  weights were developed to compensate for 
  differential probabilities of selection and 
  nonresponse. The weighted data permit 
  inferences about the eligible student 
  population who were enrolled in schools in 
  1989, 1995, and 1999. For more information

  School Associated Violent Death Study 
  (SAVD)
  
  The School Associated Violent Death Study 
  (SAVD) is an epidemiological study 
  developed by the Centers for Disease 
  Control and Prevention in conjunction 
  with the U.S. Department of Education 
  and the U.S. Department of Justice. SAVD 
  seeks to describe the epidemiology of 
  school-associated violent deaths, identify 
  common features of these deaths, estimate 
  the rate of school-associated violent 
  death in the United States, and identify 
  potential risk factors for these deaths. 
  The study includes descriptive data on all 
  school-associated violent deaths in the 
  United States, including all homicides, 
  suicides, and firearm-related deaths where 
  the fatal injury occurred on the campus of 
  a functioning elementary or secondary school, 
  while the victim was on the way to or from 
  regular sessions at such a school, or while 
  attending or on the way to or from an official 
  school-sponsored event. Victims of such 
  events include nonstudents as well as students 
  and staff members. SAVD includes descriptive 
  information about the school, event, victim(s), 
  and offender(s). The first SAVD study 
  collected data for July 1, 1992-June 30, 1994 
  and the follow-up study includes July 1, 1994-
  June 30, 1999. The follow-up study is nearing 
  completion, and data presented in this report 
  include preliminary findings for the 1998-1999 
  school year. 
  
  SAVD uses a four-step process to identify 
  and collect data on school-associated 
  violent deaths. Cases were initially 
  identified through a search of the Lexis/
  Nexis and Dialog newspaper and media databases. 
  Then police officials are contacted to 
  confirm the details of the case to determine 
  if the event meets the case definition. Once 
  a case is confirmed, a police official and 
  a school official are interviewed in regards 
  to details about the school, event, victim(s), 
  and offender(s). If police officials are 
  unwilling or unable to complete the interview, 
  a copy of the full police report is obtained. 
  The information obtained about schools 
  includes school demographics, attendance/
  absentee rates, suspension/expulsions and 
  mobility, school history of weapon carrying, 
  security measures, violence prevention 
  activities, school response to the event, and 
  school policies about weapon carrying. Event 
  information includes the location of injury, 
  the context of injury (while classes held, 
  during break, etc.), motives for injury, method 
  of injury, and school and community events 
  happening around the time period. Information 
  obtained on victim(s) and offender(s) 
  includes demographics, circumstances of the 
  event (date/time, alcohol or drug use, number 
  of persons involved), types and origins of 
  weapons, criminal history, psychological risk 
  factors, school-related problems, extracurricular 
  activities, and family history including 
  structure and stressors.
  
  One hundred and five school-associated violent 
  deaths were identified from July 1, 1992-June 
  30, 1994 (See Kachur et al. June 12, 1996. JAMA. 
  275:22: 1729-1733). While the current study is 
  still ongoing, over 250 school-associated 
  violent deaths have been identified for July 1, 
  1994-June 30, 1999. The first study achieved a 
  response rate of 85 percent for police officials 
  and 81 percent for school officials. To date, 
  the current study has achieved 96 percent for 
  police officials and 79 percent for school 
  officials. For additional information about SAVD,

  Accuracy of Estimates
  
  The accuracy of any statistic is determined 
  by the joint effects of "nonsampling" and 
  "sampling" errors. Both types of error affect 
  the estimates presented in this report. 
  Several sources can contribute to nonsampling 
  errors. For example, members of the population 
  of interest are inadvertently excluded from 
  the sampling frame; sampled members refuse 
  to answer some of the survey questions (item 
  nonresponse) or all of the survey questions 
  (questionnaire nonresponse); mistakes are made 
  during data editing, coding, or entry; the 
  responses that respondents provide differ 
  from the "true" responses; or measurement 
  instruments such as tests or questionnaires 
  fail to measure the characteristics they are 
  intended to measure. Although nonsampling 
  errors due to questionnaire and item 
  nonresponse can be reduced somewhat by 
  the adjustment of sample weights and 
  imputation procedures, correcting nonsampling 
  errors or gauging the effects of these errors 
  is usually difficult.
  
  Sampling errors occur because observations 
  are made on samples rather than on entire 
  populations. Surveys of population universes 
  are not subject to sampling errors. 
  Estimates based on a sample will differ 
  somewhat from those that would have been 
  obtained by a complete census of the 
  relevant population using the same survey 
  instruments, instructions, and procedures. 
  The standard error of a statistic is a 
  measure of the variation due to sampling; 
  it indicates the precision of the 
  statistic obtained in a particular sample. 
  In addition, the standard errors for two 
  sample statistics can be used to estimate 
  the precision of the difference between 
  the two statistics and to help determine 
  whether the difference based on the sample 
  is large enough so that it represents the 
  population difference.
  
  Most of the data used in this report 
  were obtained from complex sampling 
  designs rather than a simple random 
  design. In these sampling designs, data 
  were collected through stratification, 
  clustering, unequal selection probabilities, 
  or multistage sampling. These features 
  of the sampling usually result in estimated 
  statistics that are more variable (that 
  is, have larger standard errors) than they 
  would have been if they had been based 
  on data from a simple random sample of 
  the same size. Therefore, calculation of 
  standard errors requires procedures that 
  are markedly different from the ones used 
  when the data are from a simple random 
  sample. The Taylor series approximation 
  technique or the balanced repeated 
  replication (BRR) method was used to 
  estimate most of the statistics and their 
  standard errors in this report. Table 
  B3 lists the various methods used to 
  compute standard errors for different 
  data sets.
  
  Standard error calculation for data 
  from the National Crime Victimization 
  Survey and the School Crime Supplement 
  relied on a combination of procedures. 
  For statistics based on the 1995 and 1999 
  SCS data, the Taylor series approximation 
  method using PSU and strata variables 
  available from the data set was employed. 
  For statistics based on all years of NCVS 
  data and the 1989 SCS data, standard errors 
  were derived from a formula developed by 
  the Census Bureau, which consists of three 
  generalized variance function (gvf) constant 
  parameters that represent the curve fitted 
  to the individual standard errors calculated 
  using the Jackknife Repeated Replication 
  technique. The formulas used to compute 
  the adjusted standard errors associated with 
  percentages or population counts can be found 
  in table B3. 
  
  Statistical Procedures
  
  The comparisons in the text have been tested 
  for statistical significance to ensure that 
  the differences are larger than might be 
  expected due to sampling variations. Unless 
  otherwise noted, all statements cited in 
  the report are statistically significant at 
  the .05 level. Several test procedures were 
  used, depending upon the type of data being 
  analyzed and the nature of the statement 
  being tested. The primary test procedure 
  used in this report was the Student's t 
  statistic, which tests the difference between 
  two sample estimates, for example, between 
  males and females. The formula used to compute 
  the t statistic is as follows:
  
  (See equation in original report)
  
  where E1 and E2 are the estimates to be 
  compared and se1 and se2 are their corresponding 
  standard errors. Note that this formula is 
  valid only for independent estimates. When 
  the estimates are not independent (for 
  example, when comparing a total percentage 
  with that for a subgroup included in the 
  total), a covariance term (i.e., 2*se1*se2) 
  must be added to the denominator of the 
  formula:
  
  (See equation original report)
  
  Once the t value was computed, it was 
  compared with the published tables of values 
  at certain critical levels, called alpha 
  levels. For this report, an alpha value of 
  0.05 was used, which has a t value of 1.96. 
  If the t value was larger than 1.96, then the 
  difference between the two estimates was 
  statistically significant at the 95 percent 
  level. 
  
  When multiple comparisons among more than 
  two groups were made, for example, among racial/
  ethnic groups, a Bonferroni adjustment to the 
  significance level was used to ensure that the 
  significance level for the tests as a group 
  was at the .05 level. Generally, when multiple 
  statistical comparisons are made, it becomes 
  increasingly likely that an indication of a 
  population difference is erroneous. Even when 
  there is no difference in the population, at 
  an alpha of .05, there is still a 5 percent 
  chance of concluding that an observed t value 
  representing one comparison in the sample is 
  large enough to be statistically significant. 
  As the number of comparisons increase, the risk 
  of making such an erroneous inference also 
  increases. The Bonferroni procedure corrects 
  the significance (or alpha) level for the total 
  number of comparisons made within a particular 
  classification variable. For each classification 
  variable, there are (K*(K-1)/2) possible 
  comparisons (or nonredundant pairwise 
  combinations), where K is the number of 
  categories. The Bonferroni procedure divides 
  the alpha level for a single t test by the 
  number of possible pairwise comparisons in 
  order to produce a new alpha level that is 
  corrected for the fact that multiple 
  contrasts are being made. As a result, the t 
  value for a certain alpha level (e.g., .05) 
  increases, which makes it more difficult to 
  claim that the difference observed is 
  statistically significant.
  
  Finally, a linear trend test was used when a 
  statement describing a linear trend, rather 
  than the differences between two discrete 
  categories, was made. This test allows 
  one to examine whether, for example, the 
  percentage of students using drugs increased 
  (or decreased) over time or whether the 
  percentage of students who reported being 
  physically attacked in school increased (or 
  decreased) with their age. Based on a 
  regression with, for example, student's age 
  as the independent variable and whether a 
  student was physically attacked as the 
  dependent variable, the test involves 
  computing the regression coefficient (b) 
  and its corresponding standard error (se). 
  The ratio of these two (b/se) is the test 
  statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, 
  the critical value for one comparison at 
  the .05 alpha level, the hypothesis that 
  there is a linear relationship between 
  student's age and being physically attacked 
  is not rejected. 
  
  APPENDIX C. GLOSSARY OF TERMS
  
  General Terms
  
  Cluster sampling    
  
  Cluster sampling is a technique in which 
  the sampling of respondents or subjects 
  occurs within clusters or groups. For example, 
  selecting students by sampling schools and 
  the students that attend that school. 
  
  Crime     
  
  Any violation of a statute or regulation or 
  any act that the government has determined 
  is injurious to the public, including felonies 
  and misdemeanors. Such violation may or may 
  not involve violence, and it may affect 
  individuals or property.
  
  Incident  
  
  A specific criminal act or offense involving 
  one or more victims and one or more offenders.
  
  Multi-stage sampling     
  
  A survey sampling technique in which there 
  is more than one wave of sampling. That is, 
  one sample of units is drawn, and then another 
  sample is drawn within that sample. For example, 
  at the first stage, a number of Census blocks 
  may be sampled out of all the Census blocks in 
  the United States. At the second stage, households 
  are sampled within the previously sampled Census 
  blocks. 
  
  Prevalence     
  
  The percentage of the population directly 
  affected by crime in a given period. This rate 
  is based upon specific information elicited 
  directly from the respondent regarding crimes 
  committed against his or her person, against his 
  or her property, or against an individual bearing 
  a unique relationship to him or her. It is not 
  based upon perceptions and beliefs about, or 
  reactions to, criminal acts.
  
  School    
  
  An education institution consisting of one or 
  more of grades K through 12.
  
  School crime   
  
  Any criminal activity that is committed on 
  school property.
  
  School year    
  
  The 12-month period of time denoting the 
  beginning and ending dates for school accounting 
  purposes, usually from July 1 through June 30.
  
  Stratification 
  
  Stratification is a survey sampling technique 
  in which the target population is divided into 
  mutually exclusive groups or strata based on 
  some variable or variables (e.g., metropolitan 
  area) and sampling of units occurs separately 
  within each stratum. 
  
  Unequal probabilities    
  
  A survey sampling technique in which sampled 
  units do not have the same probability of 
  selection into the sample. For example, the 
  investigator may over-sample minority students 
  in order to increase the sample sizes of 
  minority students. Minority students would 
  then be more likely than other students to be 
  sampled. 
  
  Specific Terms Used in Various Surveys
  
  National Crime Victimization Survey
  
  At school (students)     
  
  Inside the school building, on school 
  property (school parking area, play area, 
  school bus, etc.), or on the way to or from 
  school.
  
  At school (teachers)     
  
  Inside the school building, on school property 
  (school parking area, play area, school bus, 
  etc.), at work site, or while working.  For 
  thefts, "while working" was not considered, 
  since thefts of teachers' property kept at school 
  can occur when teachers are not present.
  
  Aggravated assault  
  
  Attack or attempted attack with a weapon, 
  regardless of whether or not an injury occurs,
