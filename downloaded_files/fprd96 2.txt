Federal Pretrial Release and Detention, 1996

February 1999, NCJ  168635

By John Scalia
BJS Statistician

During 1996, 56,982 defendants were charged with a Federal
offense. At their initial court appearance, a Federal judge or
magistrate decided whether they were to be released or detained
pending adjudication of the charges.  In making the decision to
release or detain the defendant, the Federal courts follow the
requirements of the Bail Reform Act of 1984.  This act attempts
to strike a balance between the presumption of innocence and the
possible threats of crime, intimidation of witnesses, and flight
a defendant might pose.

Over half of the defendants charged (30,442) were released
following the initial court appearance, provided any
court-imposed conditions were satisfied. Almost two-thirds were
released on their own recognizance or an unsecured bond.  An
additional 21% were eligible for release on bail.  The remainder
were released under restrictive conditions such as third-party
supervision or home detention.

Highlights

(Highlights figure needs putting in)

*  34% of the 56,982 defendants charged with a Federal offense
were ordered detained by the court pending adjudication of the
charges.

* Of those defendants released pending trial, 59.7% were
released on their own recognizance (21.7%) or on an unsecured
bond (38%).

* About a quarter of those released were required to post bail
to gain release; however, 61.2% were unable to post bail on the
day they were eligible for release.

* Defendants charged with drug (35.5%) or immigration (55.6%)
offenses were required to post bail more often than those
charged with other offenses.  Among those eligible for release, 
55% of drug offenders and 92.3% of immigration offenders did not
post bail on the day they were eligible for release.

*Defendants charged with violent (49.7%), immigration (47.9%),
or drug trafficking (45.7%) offenses were detained by the court
for the entire pretrial period at a greater rate than other
offenders.

* Defendants with a criminal history were ordered detained at a
greater rate than first-time arrestees: 38.4% of defendants with
at least one prior arrest were ordered detained compared to
26.7% of first-time arrestees.

* Defendants without established ties to the community were
generally more likely to be ordered detained than other
defendants: 52.7% of noncitizens, 51.8% of transients, and 63.6%
of the homeless were ordered detained.

-----------------------------------------------------

Nearly half of defendants charged (26,222) were not eligible for
release following the initial appearance.  At the request of the
U.S. attorney, a subsequent hearing was held to determine
whether any release conditions would reduce the threat of
criminal activity by the defendant.  About three-quarters
(19,254) were ordered detained by the court following this
hearing.  Of those defendants ordered detained, 42.3% were
detained because they were considered a flight risk; 10.6% were
considered a danger to a witness,  juror, or the community; and
47% were detained for both reasons. 

Recommendations to the court

While the decision to release or detain a defendant is the
responsibility of the court, pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of
1984, both the U.S. attorneys and the pretrial services officers
may make recommendations to the court regarding whether the
defendant should be released or detained pending trial.  

During 1996 U.S. attorneys and pretrial services officers
recommended detention for nearly half of  those charged.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For about 15% of those charged, they recommended that the
defendant be released on bail.  The U.S. attorneys and the
pretrial services officers concurred in their recommendations to
the court about three-quarters of the time (not shown in a
table).

The courts concurred about three-quarters of the time with the
recommendations made by the U.S. attorneys and the pretrial
services officers.  In those cases where the courts did not
concur with the U.S. attorneys' recommendations, the courts
generally imposed less restrictive conditions than those
recommended.  During 1996 the courts released about 31% of those
defendants for whom the U.S. attorney recommended detention. 
They released without a bail requirement 40% of those defendants
for whom the U.S. attorney recommended bail.

Similarly, the courts released more than a third of those
defendants for whom the pretrial services officer recommended
detention. About 6% of those for whom the pretrial services
officer recommended release were detained by the court.

Federal pretrial release and detention practices

During 1996, 56,982 defendants were arraigned before a Federal
judicial officer (district court judge or magistrate).  The
charges filed against 318 of these defendants were dismissed.
(The 318 defendants for whom the charges filed were initially
dismissed are excluded from further analyses.)  In more than
three-quarters of the cases, the defendant was charged with a
drug offense (39.3%), a property offense (24.8%), or an
immigration offense (14.1%).  Few defendants (6.5%) were
charged with a violent offense.

Decisions to release or detain pending trial

Of the 37,410 defendants eligible for release following the
initial appearance or a detention hearing --

* 59.7% were released under minimal supervision or court-imposed
conditions -- 21.7% on their own recognizance and 38% on an
unsecured bond; and 

* 40.3% were eligible for release provided certain court-imposed
conditions were satisfied -- 25.8% on financial conditions, or
bail, and 14.5% under restrictive conditions.  

Defendants charged with less serious offenses were more likely
to be released under minimal supervision or conditions than
defendants charged with more serious offenses.  At least
three-quarters of the defendants charged with property offenses
or public-order offenses other than immigration and weapons
offenses were released on either their own recognizance or an
unsecured bond.

While 9,663 defendants were eligible for release on bail, 61% of
these did not post the required bail.  Those defendants who did
not post the required bail were detained beyond the initial
appearance or the detention hearing, where applicable.

Defendants charged with an immigration offense were the least
likely to post the required bail.  During 1996 less than 8% of
defendants charged with an immigration offense posted the
required bail (not shown in a table).

Of the 19,254 defendants for whom detention was ordered by the
court following a detention hearing, 42.3% were detained because
they were considered a flight risk, 10.6% because they were
considered a danger to either the community or prospective
witnesses or jurors, and 47% for both reasons.

Pretrial practices across Federal judicial districts

During 1996, courts detained 34% of defendants charged with a
Federal offense.  The court-ordered detention rate varied
considerably across the 94 judicial districts.  While the
court-ordered detention rate in more than half of the districts
(48 districts) was between 20% and 40%, in 20 districts the
detention rate was less than 20%; in another 20 districts the
detention rate was between 40% and 60%; and in 6 districts the
detention rate was at least 60%.  Many factors
contribute to a specific judicial district's court-ordered
detention rate.  These factors include, in part, characteristics
of the defendants charged, recommendations by the U.S. attorney
and/or pretrial services officers, and district-specific
policies regarding pretrial release and detention (see
appendices A1, A2, A3).

For instance, by statute, the U.S. attorney makes detention
recommendation to the court.  Consequently, in those districts
with the highest court-

ordered detention rates -- more than 56% of defendants charged
-- the U.S. attorneys, on average, recommended detention for 71%
of the defendants (see appendix A3). 

In those districts with the lowest court-ordered detention rates
-- less than 13% -- the U.S. attorneys recommended detention for
less than a third of those charged.

Other factors that influence a district's court-ordered
detention rate include --

* the proportion of defendants presumed by statute to be a
pretrial risk (see appendix A3)

* the proportion of defendants who were identified as
noncitizens.  

Judicial districts with a high proportion of defendants who were
either presumed to be a pretrial risk or identified as
noncitizens generally had higher rates of court-ordered
detention.

For  example, in those judicial districts where -- 

* more than a third of the defendants were presumed to be a
pretrial risk, the average rate of court-ordered detention was
43%

* more than half of the defendants were noncitizens, the average
rate of court-ordered detention was 50%.

-----------------------------------------------------

Pretrial release and detention in the Federal criminal justice
system

Bail has traditionally been used to ensure an accused person's
appearance at trial.  Under a bail system, a person accused of a
crime remains free pending trial by posting security  --
property or money -- to ensure he or she will stand trial and
submit to a sentence if found guilty.  If the defendant fails to
appear at trial, the posted security -- or bail -- is forfeited.
 If the defendant does not post bail, the defendant is detained
pending adjudication of the charges. 

Pretrial release of criminal defendants -- 

* furthers the presumption of innocence by avoiding unduly
detention 

* permits a defendant to more fully assist in the preparation of
a defense

* reduces the possibility that the defendant might be
incarcerated for a longer period than would otherwise be
appropriate for the offense committed.

Prior to 1966 the Federal courts relied almost exclusively on
bail to ensure a defendant's appearance at trial.  In 1966
Congress, in an effort to reform Federal bail practices,
de-emphasized the use of bail.  The Bail Reform Act of 1966
required the courts to release any defendant charged with a
noncapital offense on his or her own recognizance or on an
unsecured appearance bond unless the court determined that the
defendant would fail to appear for trial under such minimal
supervision.  (H.R. Rep. 1541, 89th Cong. 2nd Sess. (1966).) 

In cases where the defendant could not be released under minimal
supervision, the court could impose other conditions such as
third-party supervision, limited travel and association, bail,
and/or any other condition deemed necessary by the court to
assure the defendant's appearance at trial.

The decision to release or detain a defendant pending
adjudication of the charges has traditionally been predicated on
the likelihood of the defendant's appearance at trial.  Bail
reform legislation enacted during 1984, expanded the courts'
consideration of factors when deciding whether to grant pretrial
release.  (S. Rep.. No. 225, 98th Cong. 1st Sess. (1984).)

The Bail Reform Act of 1984 expanded the authority of the courts
to regulate pretrial release for reasons such as protecting the
community and specific individuals -- particularly prospective
witnesses and jurors -- from defendants considered too dangerous
to be released.  (18 U.S.C. Section 3142(g)(4).)  As a result, 
the Bail Reform Act of 1984 created a three-tiered approach
toward pretrial release --

* consistent with the existing policy, the 1984 act required the
pretrial release of defendants who do not pose a risk of flight
or a danger to another person or the community

* if the defendant poses either a risk of flight or a threat to
the community, the court could release the defendant pending
trial under conditions that mitigate the risks posed

* the court could detain the defendant pending trial if it is
determined that the defendant poses a risk of flight or is a
danger to another person or the community and that no condition,
or combination of conditions, would mitigate those risks.  (18
U.S.C. Section 3142(a).)

At a detention hearing (typically held within 3 to 5 days of the
defendant's arrest), the Bail Reform Act of 1984 requires the
Government to prove by clear and convincing evidence that no
condition(s) of release would reasonably ensure that the
defendant would appear for trial and not pose a risk to the
community.  (19 U.S.C. Section 3142(f).)

If the defendant is a violent recidivist or is accused of
committing the current offense while carrying a firearm or while
on pretrial release for another offense, the statute presumes
the defendant to pose a pretrial risk.  That defendant is
presumptively detained and bears the burden to show why he
should be released.  (18 U.S.C. Section 3142(e).)

Characteristics of defendants detained following a Federal
detention hearing

A detention hearing is held to determine whether any condition,
or combination of conditions, would assure the appearance of the
defendant at trial and the safety of the community and
prospective witnesses.  A U.S. attorney can request detention if
the defendant was charged with --

* a crime of violence

* an offense for which the maximum sentence is life imprisonment
or death 

* a drug offense for which the maximum sentence is 10 years or
more imprisonment

* any felony if the defendant had been convicted on two or more
occasions

* those offenses described above or similar State-level offenses.

Regardless of the U.S. attorney's  recommendation, the court can
order a detention hearing if there is a serious risk that the
defendant will attempt to avoid prosecution by fleeing or the
defendant will attempt to obstruct justice or intimidate
prospective witnesses or jurors.  (18 U.S.C. Section 3142(g).)

Statutorily prescribed factors

Federal law requires judicial officers (district court judges
and magistrates) to consider certain factors when making
pretrial detention decisions.

The factors identified by statute are -- 

* the nature and circumstances of the offense charged

* the weight of the evidence

* the financial resources

* character and mental condition of the defendant

* family ties

* employment status

* community ties and length of residency in the community

* record of appearance at court proceedings

* prior criminal convictions

* whether at the time of the current offense the defendant was
under 

criminal justice supervision

* the nature and seriousness of the danger to the community or
any person that the defendant's release would pose. (18 U.S.C.
Section 3142(f).) 

Community safety includes the risk that the defendant would
continue to engage in other criminal activity regardless of
whether physical violence was involved, including the risk that
the defendant would continue to distribute controlled
substances.  (See U.S. v. Provenzano, 605 F. 2d 85 (3rd Cir.
1979).)(S. Rep. No.  225, 98th Cong. 1st Sess. (1983); See also,
U.S. v. Hawkins, 617 F. 2d 59 (5th Cir. 1980) cert. denied, 449
U.S. 952 (1980); U.S. v. Cook, 880 F. 2d 1158 (10th Cir. 1989);
U.S. v. Strong, 775 F.2d 504 (3rd Cir. 1985).)

Offense charged

The likelihood of being ordered detained varied considerably
with the offense charged.  Consistent with the statutory
guidelines, defendants charged with more serious offenses --
such as violent and drug trafficking offenses -- were among the
most likely to be detained.  During 1996, 49.7% of defendants
charged with a violent offense and 45.7% of those charged with a
drug trafficking offense were detained by the court. 
Additionally, 40.1% of defendants charged with a weapons offense
were detained

While in more than half of the cases the court cited both flight
and danger to the community as the reasons for the  detention
decision, defendants charged with violent, drug, or weapons
offenses were generally more likely than other defendants to be
detained solely because they were a danger to either the
community or prospective witnesses or jurors.  About a quarter
of those charged with a violent or weapons offense and 10.7% of
those charged with a drug trafficking offense were ordered
detained solely for this reason.  

Defendants charged with immigration offenses were detained at a
rate comparable to violent, weapons, and drug offenders.  During
1996, 47.9% of immigration offenders were detained.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
 
The courts considered these defendants -- generally noncitizens
-- to pose a greater risk of pretrial flight than other
defendants.  Almost all (99.4%) immigration offenders who were
detained were detained because the court considered them a
flight risk -- 80.1% solely because the defendant was a flight
risk and 19.3% because the defendant was both a flight risk and
a danger to the community.

By contrast, defendants charged with  property or regulatory
offenses were less likely to be detained -- fewer than 1 in 6. 
Generally, those defendants who were considered as a flight risk
were ordered detained because the courts considered them to pose
a flight risk.


Defendant characteristics

Criminal history

Nearly two-thirds of defendants charged with a Federal offense
during 1996 had been arrested at least once prior to the current
offense; half had been previously convicted; and about a third
were under some form of criminal justice supervision at the time
of the offense.  Of those defendants with at least one
prior arrest, 77.3% had been arrested on more than one occasion:
33.9%, two to four times and 43.4%, five or more times.

The court-ordered detention rate varied considerably with the
defendant's criminal history.  Defendants with a history of
criminal misconduct were ordered detained at a higher rate than
first-time arrestees.  During 1996, 38.4% of defendants with at
least one prior arrest were ordered detained by the court
compared to 26.7% of first-time arrestees.  The likelihood of
being detained increased with the number of prior arrests: 26.9%
of defendants with one prior arrest were detained compared to
34.1% of those with two to four prior arrests and 47.9% of those
with five or more prior arrests.

--------------------------------------

Defendants with a history of committing more serious offenses
were detained at a greater rate than those with a history of
less serious offenses -- 

* 47.3% of defendants previously convicted of a felony were
detained compared to 25.9% of those previously convicted of a
misdemeanor

* 54% of defendants previously convicted of a violent felony
were detained compared to 48.1% of those previously convicted of
a drug felony and 33.3% of those convicted of other felony
offenses.

Defendants who were on parole at the time of the current offense
were among the most likely to be denied bail.  During 1996,
58.5% of parolees were detained compared to 38.6% of those
arrested while on probation, 39.4% of those arrested while on
pretrial release, and 28.4% of those not under criminal justice
supervision at the time of the offense.

History of pretrial misconduct

Approximately 22% of defendants charged with a Federal offense
during 1996 and who had previously been arrested had a history
of significant pretrial misconduct; 19.9% had previously failed
to make a scheduled court appearance and 3.6% had previously
been re-arrested while awaiting trial. 

About half of the defendants with a history of pretrial
misconduct were detained by the court: 48.5% of those with a
history of failing to appear and 41.5% of those who had been
re-arrested while awaiting trial.

Community ties

About half of the defendants charged with a Federal offense
during 1996 lived in the community in which they were arrested
for at least 1 year.

About 1 in 5 lived in the community for less than 30 days 
Defendants without established ties to the community were
detained more often than defendants with more established ties
to the community.  Defendants identified as "transients" --
living in the community for less than 30 days -- were detained
nearly 2 times more often than those who reported living in the
community for at least 5 years.  During 1996, 51.8% of
transients were detained compared to 27.3% of those living in
the community for at least 5 years.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Nearly a third of those charged with a Federal offense during
1996 were identified as noncitizens.  Noncitizens were detained
about twice as often as U.S. citizens: 52.7% of noncitizens were
denied bail compared to 25.9% of citizens.  About two-thirds
(68.3%) of the noncitizens detained were detained solely because
the court considered them to be a flight risk; 1.7% because the
court considered them to be a danger to either the community or
prospective witnesses or jurors; and 30% for both reasons (not
shown in a table).

Nearly two-thirds (63.6%) of defendants charged indicated that
they either owned (including those buying) or rented their
residence.  About a quarter indicated that they had no fixed
address -- homeless -- or otherwise made no monetary
contribution to their housing.  Defendants without a permanent
residence were more likely to be detained than those with a
permanent residence.  Nearly two-thirds of defendants identified
as homeless and 38.2% of those who made no monetary contribution
to their housing were detained.  By contrast, 16.5% of those
defendants who reported owning or buying their home and 30.9% of
those who were renting were detained.

Detention rates also varied according to the defendant's
employment status.  Defendants who were unemployed at the time
of the offense were detained at a greater rate than those who
were employed: 39.1% of defendants who were unemployed at the
time of the offense were detained by the court compared to 25.3%
of those who were employed.

Threat to the community

Under certain circumstances the defendant, rather than the
Government, bears the responsibility for proving that the
defendant is an acceptable pretrial risk and that the defendant
should be released pending trial.  Pursuant to the Bail Reform
Act of 1984, a defendant is presumed to be a pretrial risk if --

* the defendant was charged with a drug-related offense with a
statutory maximum of 10 years or more  

* the defendant was charged as a felon in possession of a
firearm pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 924(c) 

* the defendant:

-- had previously been convicted of an offense with a statutory
maximum of life imprisonment or death,  a crime of violence, or
a drug-related offense with a statutory maximum of 10 years or
more

-- the offense was committed while the defendant was on release
pending trial for another offense; and

-- the offense was committed within 5 years of a previous
conviction or release from imprisonment.  (18 U.S.C. Section
3142 (e).)

During 1996, 14.4% of defendants charged with a Federal offense
were presumed to pose a pretrial risk.

Among these defendants --

* 78% because the current offense was a serious drug offense or
because the defendant was charged as a felon in possession of a
firearm

* 22% because an offense was committed while the defendant was
on pretrial release for another offense, the offense was
committed within 5 years of a previous conviction or release
from prison; and the defendant had previously been convicted of
a serious offense (not shown in a table).  

Of those defendants presumed to pose a pretrial risk, 85% were
ordered detained by the court following the detention hearing
(not shown in a table). 

-----------------------------------------------------
Administering Federal pretrial services

The Federal Pretrial Services Act of 1982 established pretrial
services for defendants prosecuted in U.S. district courts.  (18
U.S.C.  Section 3152-3155.)  (Because the District of Columbia
had a pretrial services agency that serviced both the local
court and the U.S. district court, the District of Columbia was
exempted from establishing a separate pretrial services agency
for Federal offenders.)  In 42 of the 94 Federal judicial
districts -- primarily those districts that include large
metropolitan areas --  pretrial services are administered by a
Federal pretrial services agency.  In the remaining districts
Federal pretrial services are administered by the Federal
probation agency. 

Federal pretrial services officers have two main functions: 
investigation of persons charged with a Federal offense and
supervision of defendants released into their custody.  The
purpose of the pretrial investigation is to provide the court
with verified information on which a release or detention
decision can be made.  

As part of the investigation process, the pretrial services
officer interviews the defendant.  The officer conducts a
computerized criminal history background check and verifies any
gathered information with the defendant's family, friends,
employer, and others known to the defendant. 

While pretrial services officers are charged with supervising
each defendant released into their custody, not every defendant
is actively supervised.  Some defendants -- primarily those the
court determined to pose no flight risk or danger to the
community -- are released only under the condition that they do
not commit any offense.  

Other defendants are released under more restrictive release
conditions.  These defendants are typically required to report
to a pretrial services officer on a predetermined reporting
schedule or reside in a community treatment facility or halfway
house.  During the release period, the pretrial services officer
monitors the defendant's compliance with the release conditions
and reports to the court and the U.S. attorney any violations.
Additionally, pretrial services officers might assist released
individuals with securing employment, medical, legal, or social
services.

Demographic characteristics

The proportion of defendants ordered detained during 1996 varied
across racial and ethnic groups.  Without considering any other
defendant or offense characteristics, nonwhite defendants were
detained at a higher rate than white defendants: 46.7% of
Hispanic defendants, 35.9% of black defendants, and 32.8% of
other nonwhite defendants were detained by the court compared to
19.3% of white defendants.

Younger defendants were more likely than older defendants to be
detained.  About 40% of those under the age of 40 were detained
compared to 31.5% of those over 40.  Additionally, the
likelihood that the defendant would be detained decreased as the
defendant's educational level increased:  40.5% of defendants
without a high school education were detained compared to 29.3%
of those with a high school education (or equivalent), 22.1% of
those with some college; and 14.6% of those with a college
degree. 

The detention rate for specific racial/ethnic groups was
influenced by factors the courts were required, by statute, to
consider.  In general, minority defendants were more likely to
be characterized by these statutory factors than white
defendants.  For example, the relatively high detention rate for
Hispanic defendants was attributable, in part, to the high
proportion (69.8%) of Hispanics who were identified as
noncitizens (not shown in table).  Additionally, 64.2% of
Hispanics charged with a Federal offense during 1996 lived in
the community for less than 1 year at the time of the arrest.  

Compared to white defendants, a greater proportion of black and
Hispanic defendants were charged with a drug trafficking
offense:  43.6% of black defendants and 42.5% of Hispanic
defendants were charged with a drug trafficking offense compared
to 25.5% of white defendants.  White defendants were
more likely to be charged with property or regulatory offenses:
43.2% of white defendants were charged with a property offense
or a regulatory offense compared to 28.7% of black defendants
and 11.5% of Hispanic defendants.

Black defendants generally had more extensive criminal histories
than white or Hispanic defendants.  Three-quarters of black
defendants had been arrested on at least one prior occasion
compared to 60.5% of whites and 56.6% of Hispanics.

Of those defendants who had been arrested on at least one prior
occasion, 38.9% of black defendants had been arrested at least 
five times compared to 23.1% of Hispanics, 24% of whites, and
15% of other nonwhite defendants.

Forty-six percent of the black defendants charged with a Federal
offense during 1996 had been previously convicted of a felony. 
Most (82.4%) of these prior felony convictions were for either a
violent (49.6%) or drug (32.8%) offense.

By contrast, fewer than 1 in 3 defendants of other racial or ethnic
groups had previously been convicted of a felony.

Black and Hispanic defendants were also more likely than whites
to meet the statutory criteria for presumptive detention. 
During 1996, 20.9% of black defendants and 15.9% of Hispanic
defendants were presumed to pose a pretrial risk.  By contrast,
10.6% of other nonwhite defendants and 8.5% of white defendants
were presumed to pose a pretrial risk (not shown in a table)


Methodology

Data Sources

The source of the data for tables that describe Federal
defendants is the BJS Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP)
database (ICPSR 9296).  The FJSP database is presently
constructed from source files provided by the Executive Office
for the United States Attorneys, the Administrative Office of
the U.S. Courts, the United States Sentencing Commission, and
the Federal Bureau of Prisons.  The Administrative Office of the
U.S. Courts also maintains data collected by the Federal
pretrial services agencies.  

The pretrial services agency data describes defendants charged
with a Federal offense and interviewed and investigated by
Federal pretrial service officers.  Data tabulations, except
where otherwise indicated, were prepared from BJS or contractor
analysis of the source agency datasets.  (Because the District
of Columbia operates its pretrial services agency separate from
the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, data describing
defendants prosecuted in the U.S. district court for the
District of Columbia but processed by the D.C. pretrial services
agency are not included in this analysis.)

Statistics describing State defendants is BJS's State Court
Processing Statistics Program (SCPS) C formerly the National
Pretrial Reporting Program.  The SCPS program collects data
describing the processing of felony defendants in the courts of
the Nation's 75 most populous counties.  For a complete
description of the SCPS program, see Felony Defendants in Large
Urban Counties, 1994, BJS report (NCJ-164616).

The offense categories used in this report are based primarily
on the offense codes established by the Administrative Office of
the U.S. Courts.  The Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics
provides a detailed description of the United States Criminal Code 
titles and sections included in each offense category.

The forms of pretrial release reported are reported as mutually
exclusive categories.  In practice, however, a single defendant
may be release on more than one form, or condition, of pretrial
release.  For example, a defendant released on his or her own
recognizance may also be required to submit to periodic drug
testing while on release.  Where a defendant was released on
multiple forms of release, the form of  release selected for 
reporting purposes was selected according to the following
hierarchy:  personal recognizance, unsecured bond, bail,
restrictive conditions only.

Unlike other BJS publications describing the Federal criminal
justice system, this report describes pretrial release and
detention decisions made by the court either initially -- at
initial appearance -- or following a pretrial detention hearing
held pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 3142(f).  This report focuses on
the incoming cohort to Federal pretrial sentences.  In addition,
the events reported reflect those events occurring at the
initial appearance or at detention hearing. Events occurring
after these proceedings such as the posting of bail are not
reported.

By contrast, in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics,
statistics describing defendants released or detained reflect
the entire pretrial period.  A released defendant may have been
subsequently detained due to misconduct.  In Compendium
tabulations, these defendants are included in both counts of
defendants released and defendants detained pending trial.  In
addition, the Compendium reports statistics describing the
exiting cohort -- those defendants whose cases were terminated
by the Federal courts.
