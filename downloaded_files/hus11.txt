Patterns & Trends

Homicide in the U.S. Known to Law Enforcement, 2011

Erica L. Smith and Alexia Cooper, Ph.D., BJS Statisticians

In 2011, an estimated 14,610 persons were victims of 
homicide in the United States, according to FBI data on 
homicides known to state and local law enforcement (figure 
1). This is the lowest number of homicide victims since 
1968, and marks the fifth consecutive year of decline. The 
homicide rate in 2011 was 4.7 homicides per 100,000 
persons, the lowest level since 1963. This homicide rate 
was also 54% below its peak of 10.2 per 100,000 persons in 
1980 and 17% below the rate in 2002 (5.6 homicides per 
100,000). 

These findings are based on analyses conducted by the 
Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) using data from the 
FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR). The SHR 
collects detailed information on each homicide reported to 
state and local law enforcement in the United States, 
including victim and suspected offender demographic 
characteristics, the type of weapon used during the 
incident, and the number of victims killed during the 
incident. This report describes homicides known to law 
enforcement in 2011, the most recent year for which 
detailed data are available, and examines homicide trends 
from 1992 to 2011, with selected findings from 1960.

****************************************************

************
Highlights
************ 

* The U.S. homicide rate declined by nearly half (49%), 
from 9.3 homicides per 100,000 U.S. residents in 1992 to 
4.7 in 2011, falling to the lowest level since 1963. 

* From 2002 to 2011, the average homicide rate for males 
was 3.6 times higher than the rate for females. The 
average homicide rate for blacks was 6.3 times higher than 
the rate for whites. 

* From 2002 to 2011, young adults ages 18 to 24 had the 
highest homicide rate of any age group and experienced the 
greatest rate decline (down 22%) over the 10-year period, 
from 15.2 per 100,000 in 2002 to 11.9 in 2011. 

* The rate of homicides involving a firearm decreased by 
49% from 1992 to 2011, while the percentage of homicide 
victims killed by a firearm (67%) remained stable. 

* Large cities of 100,000 or more residents experienced 
the largest decline (23%) in homicide rates from 2002 to 
2011, compared to communities with less than 100,000 
residents. 

* From 2002 to 2011, the majority (95%) of homicide 
incidents involved a single victim. In 2011, 66% of 
homicides with a single victim involved a firearm, 
compared to 79% of homicide incidents with multiple 
victims.
****************************************************

******************************************
Two national sources of homicide data: 
the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports 
(SHR) and the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention’s (CDC) National Vital 
Statistics System (NVSS)
******************************************

National estimates of the annual number of homicides known 
to law enforcement in the United States found in this 
report are derived from data submitted to the FBI’s 
Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. ***Footnote 1 For 
more information on the FBI’s UCR, see 
www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/ucr.*** In 2011, more than 18,000 law 
enforcement agencies voluntarily submitted annual summary 
counts of crimes brought to their attention that year. 
More detailed information specifically on homicides is 
collected by the FBI through the Supplementary Homicide 
Reports (SHR), which is part of the UCR. Instead of a 
summary count of homicides, participating law enforcement 
agencies provide information on the sex, age, and race of 
homicide victims and offenders, as well as other incident- 
and victim-specific characteristics, such as the victim-
offender relationship, weapon use, and circumstance of the 
crime.

The SHR captures only information on criminal homicide 
incidents known and handled by state and local law 
enforcement that occur in the United States, including 
homicides involving victims who were not U.S. residents. 
Homicides of U.S. residents that occur outside of the 
United States and homicides handled by federal law 
enforcement are not included in the SHR data. Homicides 
that are classified as negligent or involuntary are also 
not included in the SHR. In this analysis of the SHR data, 
homicide is defined as homicides known to law enforcement 
that were classified as murder or nonnegligent 
manslaughter. In the SHR, the determination that a crime 
was a homicide is made solely based on police 
investigation, and is not the result of the decision of a 
court, medical examiner, coroner, jury, or other non-law 
enforcement entity.

A second source of national data on homicide is the 
National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), a data collection 
administered by the National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS), a division of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC). Data collected through the NVSS provide 
information on the number of injury-related deaths and the 
death rate for U.S. residents, as well as demographic 
information about the victims. These data are based on 
death certificates filed with state vital-statistics 
offices in the 50 states and the District of Columbia that 
include primary cause of death.

Cause of death is coded using the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health 
Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10). The definition of 
homicide used in the ICD-10 is “injuries inflicted by 
another person with intent to injure or kill, by any 
means.” In the NVSS, the determination that a death was a 
homicide is made by the physician, medical examiner, or 
coroner responsible for certifying the death certificate. 
In the calculation of the homicide rate, the NVSS does not 
include homicides resulting from legal intervention and 
operations of war. However, the NVSS does include deaths 
resulting from assault that occurred one year or more 
after the originating event. For more information, see the 
online version of the ICD-10, available from the World 
Health Organization at 
http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/icdonlineversions/en/.

Of the two sources, NVSS data estimate a higher annual 
number of homicides. Over the 20-year period from 1992 to 
2011, the NVSS count of homicides was consistently higher 
than the homicide count estimated from SHR data (figure 
2). The NVSS average annual estimate was about 1,255 
homicides higher than the SHR annual estimate. Similarly, 
the average homicide rate based on the NVSS was 0.4 
homicides per 100,000 persons higher than the homicide 
rate based on the SHR (figure 3). Despite these 
differences, the two sources show very similar trends for 
the number and rate of homicides over the most recent 10-
year period. From 2002 to 2011, both the NVSS and the SHR 
reported a 10% decrease in the number of homicides and a 
17% decline in the homicide rate.
****************************************************

*************************************
The U.S. homicide rate declined by 
nearly half (49%) from 1992 to 2011
*************************************
 
Over the 20-year period from 1992 to 2011, the rate of 
homicide in the United States declined by 49%, from 
9.3 homicides per 100,000 residents in 1992 to 4.7 in 2011 
(figure 4). The decline in the homicide rate was higher 
during the 10-year period from 1992 to 2001 (down 39%) 
than from 2002 to 2011 (down 17%). 

On average, the homicide rate for males was 3.6 times 
higher than the homicide rate for females, from 1992 to 
2011. Both sexes experienced similar declines in their 
overall rates of homicide during the 20-year period. From 
1992 to 2011, the murder rate declined by half for both 
males (50%) and females (49%). 

*************************************
The homicide rate in 2011 was highest 
among males, blacks, and young adults 
*************************************

In 2011, the murder rate for males was 7.4 homicides per 
100,000 males, or an estimated 11,370 male homicide 
victims (table 1). The murder rate for females in 2011 was 
2.0 homicides per 100,000 females, or about 3,240 female 
homicide victims. From 2002 to 2011, the homicide rate 
among males declined by 16%, while the rate for females 
decreased by 20%.

From 2002 to 2011, the homicide rate for blacks was 
6.3 times higher than the rate for whites. Over this 
10-year period, the homicide rate among whites decreased 
by 17%, from 3.3 homicides per 100,000 in 2002 to 2.8 in 
2011. Similarly, the homicide rate among blacks declined 
by 19%, from 21.2 per 100,000 in 2002 to 17.3 in 2011. The 
homicide rate for persons of other races—persons 
identified as American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, 
Native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander—experienced the 
greatest decline (down 33%), from 2.7 homicides per 
100,000 persons in 2002 to 1.8 in 2011.
 
In 2011, age 30 was the median age of homicide victims, 
(i.e., half of all murder victims were age 30 or younger 
and half were age 30 or older). From 2002 to 2011, young 
adults ages 18 to 24 had the highest homicide rate of any 
age group. Young adults also experienced the largest 
homicide rate decline (down 22%), from 15.2 per 100,000 in 
2002 to 11.9 in 2011. Persons age 65 or older (down 17%) 
and youth ages 12 to 17 (down 19%) also experienced large 
declines in their homicide rates from 2002 to 2011.

***********************************
The peak homicide victimization 
rate for black males was nearly 
9 times higher than the peak rate 
for white males 
***********************************

The homicide rate was analyzed by age for white males, 
black males, white females, and black females to examine 
differences in the rates by age for those demographic 
groups. To achieve a sufficient number of cases to support 
this analysis, homicide and population data were 
aggregated across the 10-year period from 2002 to 2011. 
The magnitude of the homicide rate for males varied by age 
and race, although the patterns by age among black and 
white males were similar (figure 5). For example, males 
under age 15 experienced the highest rate of homicide 
during the first year of life, regardless of race. During 
the 10-year period from 2002 to 2011, the average homicide 
rate for white males under age 1 was 5.1 homicides per 
100,000, compared to 12.5 per 100,000 for black males 
younger than age 1.
 
The homicide victimization rate for both white and black 
males increased after age 14 and into the early 20s, 
although with dramatically different trajectories. The 
homicide rate for white males peaked at age 20 (11.4 
homicides per 100,000 white males), while the homicide 
rate for black males peaked at age 23 (100.3 homicides per 
100,000 black males). The highest murder rate for black 
males was nearly 9 times higher than the highest rate for 
white males. After peaking for victims in their early 20s, 
the murder rate for both white and black males declined 
with age. For victims age 60 or older, the homicide rate 
for black males was more than 4 higher than the rate for 
white males. 

***********************************
The homicide victimization rate for
females was highest during the 
first year of life 
***********************************

For the 10-year period from 2002 to 2011, females younger 
than age 1 had a higher murder rate than females of any 
other age group (figure 6). The homicide rate for females 
younger than age 1 was 4.5 homicides per 100,000 for white 
females and 10.3 per 100,000 for black females. Among 
white females, the homicide rate was highest during the 
first year of life. However, among black females, the 
homicide rate peaked at age 22 (11.8 homicides per 100,000 
black females), a level slightly above the rate for black 
females younger than age 1. In comparison, the homicide 
rate for white females at age 22 was 37% lower than the 
homicide rate for white females younger than age 1.

As with male homicide victims, the murder rates for black 
females and white females followed similar trends across 
age groups. The average homicide rate for black females 
was over 3 times higher than the rate for white females. 
For both black females and white females, the youth murder 
rate decreased after age 1. After age 11, the female 
homicide rate for both races increased substantially. The 
homicide rate for white females age 11 or older was 
greatest for ages 20 to 31, with an average homicide rate 
of 2.8 per 100,000. In comparison, the homicide rate for 
black females age 11 or older was highest for those ages 
21 to 26, with an average homicide rate of 11.4 per 
100,000. The peak rate for black females age 11 or older 
was 4 times higher than the peak rate for white females 
age 11 or older.

Homicide rates among black and white females declined with 
age after age 30. Among victims age 60 or older, black 
females experienced a homicide rate that was approximately 
2 times higher than the rate for white females. In 
addition, the rate remained stable among white females age 
75 or older, while the homicide rate among black females 
age 75 or older increased, from 2.2 homicides per 100,000 
for persons age 75 to 3.6 per 100,000 for those age 83. 

***********************************
The rate of homicides involving a 
firearm decreased by half from 
1992 to 2011 
***********************************

The homicide rate declined from 1992 to 2011, regardless 
of the type of weapon used in the crime. In 1992, the 
murder rate for incidents involving a firearm was 
6.3 homicides per 100,000 persons (figure 7). By 2011, the 
firearm-involved homicide rate was 3.2 per 100,000, a 
decline of 49% from 1992. Overall, the total number of 
homicide incidents involving a firearm declined from more 
than 16,100 in 1992 to approximately 9,900 in 2011 (not 
shown in figure). 

Declines in the number and rate of firearm-involved 
homicides known to law enforcement are consistent with 
declines seen in analysis of data in which homicide was 
the primary cause of death, as recorded by physicians, 
medical examiners, and coroners through the National Vital 
Statistics System (NVSS), a data collection of the 
National Center on Health Statistics within the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Over the 
same 20-year period, the age-adjusted firearm homicide 
rate based on data from the NVSS declined 45%, from 6.5 
homicides per 100,000 in 1992 to 3.6 per 100,000 in 2011 
(not shown in figure).***Foonote 2 Estimates of firearm-involved 
homicides from 1992 to 2010 were retrieved from Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and 
Control, Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System 
(WISQARS), 1992–2010, retrieved November 2013 from 
www.cdc.gov/ncipc/wisqars. Preliminary estimates for 2011 firearm-
involved homicides were retrieved from Hoyert, D.L. & Xu, J.Q. (2012), 
Deaths: Preliminary data for 2011, National Vital Statistics Reports, 
61(6).*** For more information, see the two national sources of 
homicide data in this report and the BJS report Firearm Violence, 
1993–2011, NCJ 241730, BJS web, May 2013. 

The homicide rate for incidents involving other types of 
weapons also declined from 1992 to 2011. During this 20-
year period, the rate of murder involving a knife or blunt 
object declined by 55%, and the rate of murder involving a 
personal weapon (including fists or feet and pushing or 
strangling the victim) decreased by 47%. The rate of 
homicide involving other nonpersonal weapons (e.g., 
poison, explosives, fire, narcotics, and unknown weapons) 
declined by 34%.

****************************************************

***********************************
Missing information on 
homicide offenders
***********************************

Using data from the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) to 
estimate the characteristics of homicide offenders is problematic due to 
the number of homicides in the data file with no information on the 
offender demographic characteristics. This offender information could be 
missing because either the reporting law enforcement agency did not 
identify a suspect (i.e., the offender was unknown) or the agency did not 
report the information to the SHR (i.e., the offender was known but the 
information was not reported). In 2011, the most recent year for which 
SHR data are available, 31% of homicide victims had missing corresponding 
information on all three primary demographic characteristics (i.e., sex, 
race, and age) for homicide offenders (table 2). 

In addition, missing information about the offender is not distributed 
uniformly across homicide victims. Instead, it varies depending on the 
characteristics of the victim. For example, the demographic 
characteristics of the homicide offender were more likely to be missing 
in the SHR data when the homicide victims were male (36%) compared to 
female (16%), black (40%) compared to white (23%), older juveniles ages 
12 to 17 (34%) compared to younger juveniles age 11 or younger (9%), and 
adults ages 18 to 34 (37%) compared to adults age 35 or older (24%). 

Studying data on crimes cleared (i.e., considered by law enforcement to 
be solved) can provide information on the degree to which the missing 
offender information in the SHR data is the result of either the offender 
being unknown or the offender information being known to law enforcement 
but not reported in the data. A murder is cleared, or considered solved, 
by law enforcement when an offender is arrested for the crime, or when an 
offender is identified but cannot be arrested (e.g., the offender is 
deceased).

Information on whether each reported homicide is cleared is not included 
as part of the SHR. However, through a separate data collection effort, 
the FBI compiles information from law enforcement agencies on the total 
number of murders cleared each year. From 1992 to 2011, the average 
annual murder clearance rate reported by the FBI was 64%, meaning that 
law enforcement could not identify an offender in 36% of murders. During 
the same period, the percentage of murders not cleared by law enforcement 
was, on average, about 2% lower than the percentage of homicides for 
which the sex, race, and age of the offender were missing in the SHR data 
(figure 8). This implies that for more than 9 in 10 murders known to law 
enforcement for which corresponding offender information was not 
available, the information was missing because the law enforcement agency 
did not identify a suspect in the crime. 
****************************************************

***********************************
The percentage of victims killed 
by a firearm remained relatively 
stable from 1992 to 2011 
***********************************

While the rate of murder involving a firearm declined by half from 1992 
to 2011 for both males and females (figures 9 and 10), the percentage of 
male and female murders committed with a firearm changed little over the 
period (figures 11 and 12). In both 1992 and 2011, firearms were 
reportedly used in 73% of all murders of males and in 49% of all murders 
of females, with minor fluctuations during the period. 

Handguns were more commonly involved in homicides than other types of 
firearms. From 1992 to 2011, handguns were used in an average of 57% of 
male homicides and in 35% of female homicides. An additional 16% of male 
homicide victims and 13% of female homicide victims were killed with some 
other type of firearm (e.g., rifles, shotguns, and firearms of unknown 
type). 

***********************************
The percentage of homicides that 
involved a firearm was generally 
stable across periods for various 
victim types 
***********************************

The percentage of homicides involving a firearm was examined by age for 
white males, black males, white females, and black females across 
different periods to assess whether the percentage of homicides involving 
a firearm had changed over time for different demographics of victims. 
Data on the percentage of homicides known to law enforcement agencies 
that involved a firearm were calculated for the most recent period from 
2008 to 2011 and compared to the percentage of firearm-involved homicides 
from 1992 to 1995, the period within the past 20 years during which the 
homicide rate peaked. 

Overall, the percentage of homicides involving a firearm was similar 
across the two periods, regardless of victim demographics. Although the 
number and rate of homicides have both decreased substantially since the 
early 1990s, the nature of firearm use in homicides has not changed. Data 
show that white males were the only demographic category to have a 
noticeable decrease in the percentage of homicides involving a firearm 
from the early to mid-1990s to the late 2000s (figure 13). For white 
females, the percentage of firearm-involved homicides was nearly the same 
during the two periods, regardless of age (figure 14).
 
Among black male and black female victims, the percentage of murders 
involving a firearm was similar between the early to mid-1990s and the 
late 2000s, with a few exceptions (figures 15 and 16). For example, black 
male victims ages 25 to 45 experienced a higher proportion of homicides 
involving a firearm from 2008 to 2011 than from 1992 to 1995, while the 
opposite was true for white male victims in the same age range. In 
addition, black female victims ages 18 to 41 were more likely to be 
murdered with a firearm from 2008 to 2011 than from 1992 to 1995. In 
comparison, the percentage of white females ages 18 to 41 killed with a 
firearm was lower during the most recent period than during the early to 
mid-1990s.

****************************************************

***********************************
Firearm use in nonfatal violent 
Victimizations
***********************************

The proportion of nonfatal violent victimizations (rape or sexual 
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault) involving a 
firearm was calculated to examine whether it followed the same trend over 
time as the proportion of homicides involving a firearm. Data on nonfatal 
violent victimizations come from BJS’s National Crime Victimization 
Survey (NCVS), which collects information on nonfatal crimes reported and 
not reported to the police against persons age 12 or older from a 
nationally representative sample of U.S. households. The percentages of 
nonfatal violent victimizations of males and females age 12 or older that 
involved a firearm were compared for the periods 1993 to 1995 and 2008 to 
2011 for six different victim age categories. Like the pattern among 
homicides, the proportion of nonfatal violent victimizations involving a 
firearm for 1993 to 1995 was similar to the proportion for 2008 to 2011, 
across most of the victim sex and age groups (figures 17 and 18). Exceptions 
were found in three categories of victims—males ages 12 to 17, females ages 
12 to 17, and males ages 35 to 49—each of which experienced a decrease 
between the two periods in the percentage of nonfatal violent victimizations 
involving a firearm. For additional information on nonfatal violent 
victimizations involving firearms, see Firearm Violence, 1993–2011, 
NCJ 241730, BJS web, May 2013, and National Crime Victimization Survey 
(NCVS) data on the BJS website.
****************************************************

***********************************
In 2011, the homicide rate in all 
types of communities fell to the 
lowest point in 20 years 
***********************************

Using SHR data, trends in homicide rates were examined for five different 
types of communities: large cities with 500,000 or more residents, large 
cities with 100,000 to 499,999 residents, small cities with 99,999 or 
fewer residents, suburban areas, and rural areas. The murder rate in all 
five types of communities decreased from 1992 to 2011 (figure 19). The 
largest declines occurred from 1992 to 2002. During this period, the 
homicide rate declined by half (down 49%) in the largest urban areas with 
500,000 or more residents and decreased by about a third both in urban 
areas with 100,000 to 499,999 residents (down 37%) and in urban areas 
with 99,999 or fewer residents (down 31%). The homicide rate in suburban 
areas declined by 42%, and in rural areas by 27%.
 
From 2002 to 2011, the murder rate also declined in each type of 
community, but by a smaller percentage. Large urban areas had the largest 
declines. Cities with 100,000 to 499,999 residents and those with 500,000 
or more residents experienced a 23% decline in the murder rates during 
this period. In large cities with populations of 500,000 or more 
residents, the homicide rate decreased from 14.2 homicides per 100,000 in 
2002 to 10.9 in 2011. Similarly, in cities with populations of 100,000 to 
499,999, the rate declined from 9.9 homicides per 100,000 in 2002 to 7.7 
in 2011. 

Although the murder rate in other types of communities also dropped from 
2002 to 2011, the declines were more modest. The homicide rate in 
suburban areas declined by 13% over the 10-year period from 2002–2011, 
from 5.4 to 4.7 homicides per 100,000. In comparison, the homicide rate 
in small cities with 99,999 or fewer residents did not change 
substantially, decreasing from 2.0 homicides per 100,000 in 2002 to 1.8 
in 2011. Rural areas also saw little change, declining from 3.4 homicides 
per 100,000 in 2002 to 3.1 in 2011.

***********************************
The homicide rate in large cities 
decreased by nearly a quarter from 
2002 to 2011 
***********************************

To better examine trends in murder rates by type of community from 2002 
to 2011, the annual homicide rate from 2003 to 2011 was compared to the 
2002 rate in that area. The absolute change in the rate was calculated 
for each year, with positive numbers indicating an increase from the 
homicide rate in 2002 and negative numbers demonstrating a reduction from 
the 2002 baseline. This allowed for an examination of the trends in the 
homicide rate for each type of community. 

Cities with 100,000 or more residents showed the largest decreases in 
homicide rates from 2002 to 2011, but the decline was not uniform across 
the period (figure 20). For example, while large cities with 500,000 or 
more residents experienced the largest net decline over the period, the 
murder rates in 2002 and 2006 were similar. After 2006, the homicide rate 
dropped rapidly, reaching its lowest level in the last decade in 2011. 

In comparison to large cities, the homicide rate in suburban areas 
increased slightly from 2002 to 2007, then decreased through 2011. While 
the rate fluctuated over the 10-year period, the overall number of 
homicides in suburban areas in 2011 was nearly equal to the number in 
2002. Small cities with less than 100,000 residents and rural areas also 
experienced little change in their respective homicide rates from 2002 to 
2011.

***********************************
Rural areas experienced a decrease 
in the percentage of homicides 
involving a firearm from 1992 to 2011 
***********************************

From 1992 to 2011, the percentage of homicides involving a firearm 
fluctuated for all five types of communities (figure 21). During that 
period, the percentage of homicide victims killed with a firearm 
increased by nearly 6 percentage points in urban areas with 100,000 to 
499,999 residents, but decreased about 2 percentage points in urban areas 
with 500,000 or more residents. The overall percentage of homicides 
involving a firearm in small cities with 99,999 or fewer residents and in 
suburban areas was about the same in 2011 as in 1992. In rural areas, the 
percentage of homicides involving a firearm decreased by 8 percentage 
points during the same period. 

From 2002 to 2011, rural areas experienced an overall decline in the 
percentage of homicides involving a firearm. In comparison, urban areas 
with 100,000 to 499,999 residents and those with 500,000 or more 
residents experienced an increase in the percentage of homicides 
involving a firearm. 

***********************************
The percentage of males and females 
killed with a firearm differed by 
community type 
***********************************

Overall, an estimated two-thirds (68%) of murders that occurred in 2011 
involved a firearm, with nearly half (49%) involving a handgun (table 3). 
Knives or blunt objects were used in 17% of homicides, and personal 
weapons (e.g., hands, fists, or feet) and other weapons (e.g., poison, 
fire, or explosives) were used in 15% of murders.

In 2011, males (73%) were more likely than females (49%) to be killed 
with a firearm. In comparison, female homicide victims were more likely 
than male victims to be killed with a weapon other than a firearm. The 
percentage of female victims killed with a personal weapon (15%) in 2011 
was 3 times higher than the comparable percentage of male victims (5%). 

The type of community in which the homicide occurred was also related to 
the type of weapon used in the homicide. Across all types of communities 
in 2011, a higher proportion of male homicide victims was killed by a 
firearm than any other weapon. In urban and suburban areas, homicides of 
males involving a firearm were more than twice as likely to include a 
handgun than other types of firearms (e.g., a rifle, shotgun, or firearm 
of an unreported type). In the largest cities with 1 million or more 
residents, homicides involving a handgun were even more common, with male 
victims being 10 times more likely to be killed by a handgun (72%) than 
other types of firearms (7%). In comparison, male homicide victims in 
rural areas were almost equally likely to be killed with a handgun (32%) 
as another type of firearm other than a handgun (27%). 

***********************************
About half of all firearm homicides 
in rural areas involved a firearm 
other than a handgun 
***********************************

In 2011, of the more than 9,900 homicides involving a firearm, an 
estimated 73% involved a handgun (table 4). The percentage of firearm 
homicides committed with a handgun was similar among males and females, 
although the percentage fluctuated by type of community. Firearm 
homicides were more likely to involve a handgun if the murder occurred in 
a large city with 1 million or more residents (91%) than other urban 
areas, regardless of the sex of the victim. Similarly, nearly half (47%) 
of firearm homicides that occurred in rural areas involved a firearm 
other than a handgun, such as a rifle, shotgun, or other unspecified 
firearm, compared to about a quarter (24%) of firearm homicides in urban 
areas and about a third (31%) of firearm homicides in suburban areas.

***********************************
Since 2002, the percentage of homicide 
incidents involving two or more victims 
has remained relatively stable 
***********************************

From 2002 to 2011, the majority (95%) of homicide incidents involved the 
killing of a single victim (not shown in figure).3 During the same 
period, about 4% of homicide incidents involved two victims, 0.6% 
involved three victims, and 0.2% involved four or more victims (figure 
22). In 2011, about 110 homicide incidents involved three victims, or 
less than 1% of all homicides that year. Homicide incidents involving 
four or more victims were even less frequent. In 2011, of an estimated 
13,750 reported homicide incidents, about 25 involved four or more 
victims. 

***********************************
Multiple-victim homicides were more 
likely than single-victim homicides 
to involve firearms other than handguns
***********************************

In 2011, 66% of single-victim homicides involved a firearm, and 79% of 
homicide incidents with multiple victims involved a firearm (table 5). 
Among homicides reported by law enforcement, the percentage of homicide 
incidents involving a firearm increased with the number of victims killed 
in the incident. In 2011, 77% of incidents in which two victims were 
killed involved a firearm, compared to 82% among homicides in which three 
victims were killed. For incidents involving four or more victims, 91% of 
the homicides involved a firearm.
 
The percentage of homicides involving a handgun (49%) remained relatively 
stable, regardless of the number of victims killed during the incident. 
However, a larger percentage of multiple-victim homicides than single-
victim homicides involved a firearm other than a handgun. An estimated 
17% of homicides involving one victim were committed with a firearm other 
than a handgun, compared to 25% of homicides involving two victims, 35% 
of homicides involving three victims, and 47% of homicides involving four 
or more victims.

*************
Methodology
************* 

Data sources 
*************

The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program, launched over 80 years 
ago, collects and publishes annual statistics on criminal offenses known 
to law enforcement and on arrests. Information on reported offenses is 
limited to eight offenses: homicide, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated 
assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. Data on 
the number of arrests includes many additional types of crime, such as 
drug abuse violations and driving under the influence. The FBI annually 
publishes data from the UCR in Crime in the United States, available at 
http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/ucr#ucr_cius. The UCR is one of two 
major national indicators about crime, along with BJS’s National Crime 
Victimization Survey (NCVS). For more information about these two 
indicators, see The Nation’s Two Crime Measures, NCJ 122705, BJS web, 
October 2004. 

The UCR collects data on only those crimes that come to the attention of 
law enforcement through direct reports or observation. Of all the crimes 
included in the UCR, homicide incidents are the most completely 
documented. Information on other serious offenses (e.g., forcible rape, 
robbery, and aggravated assault) is currently available at the national 
level only in summary counts and without any details about the incident, 
victims, or offenders. Such incident-specific detail is available 
nationally on homicides through the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports 
(SHR). 

Supplementary Homicide Reports 
*******************************

Most of the data used in this report are from the SHR, which is a part of 
the FBI’s UCR program. Supplementary data about homicide incidents 
include details on location, weapon, and victim and offender demographic 
characteristics. These SHR data include information on the reporting 
agency and its residential population; county and Metropolitan 
Statistical Area designations; geographical division and population 
group; the sex, age, and race of victims and offenders; and the victim-
offender relationship, weapon use, and circumstance of the crime. 
Contributing law enforcement agencies provided supplementary homicide 
data for 317,492 (89%) of the estimated 356,470 murders that took place 
from 1992 to 2011.
 
In this report, homicide is used interchangeably with murder, and 
includes both murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, which is the willful 
killing of one human being by another. The analyses presented exclude 
deaths caused by negligence, suicide, or accident; justifiable homicides; 
attempts to murder; and murders of U.S. residents that occurred outside 
the United States. Deaths from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 
2001, are also not included in these analyses. The data included in the 
SHR are on homicides known to law enforcement. The determination that a 
crime was a homicide was made solely based on police investigation rather 
than the decision of a court, medical examiner, coroner, jury, or other 
non-law enforcement entity. 

All rates were calculated by dividing the estimated number of homicide 
victims by estimates of the U.S. resident population for the appropriate 
group. This report used bridged-race population estimates developed by 
the National Center for Health Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau, 
unless otherwise specified. The bridged-race data are available at 
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_ race/data_documentation.htm. All 
rates were per 100,000 U.S. residents.
 
Homicide estimates in this report were based on homicides with known 
attributes and have been rounded to the nearest 5, unless otherwise 
indicated. The National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) stores 
the data from which the analyses in this report are based. Annual SHR 
data files are available from NACJD at www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD.
 
Weighting
********** 

The SHR data were weighted to compensate for the average annual 10% of 
homicides that were not reported to the SHR. The development of the set 
of annual weights is a three-step process. 

Each year the FBI’s annual Crime in the United States report presents a 
national estimate of murder victims in the United States and estimates of 
the number of murder victims in each of the 50 states and the District of 
Columbia. The first stage weight uses the FBI’s annual estimates of 
murder victims in each state and the number of murder victims from that 
state found in the annual SHR database. 

Specifically, the first stage weight for victims in state S in year Y is—
              FBI’s estimate of murder victims in state S(Year Y)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Number of murder victims in the SHR file from state S(Year Y)

For complete reporting states, this first stage weight is equal to 1. For 
partial reporting states, this weight is greater than 1. For states with 
a first stage weight greater than 2—that is, the state reported SHR data 
for less than half of the FBI’s estimated number of murder victims in the 
state—the first stage weight is set to 1. 

The second stage weight uses the FBI’s annual national estimates of 
murder victims in the United States and the sum of the first stage 
weights for each state. The second stage weight for victims in all states 
in year Y is— 
 
          FBI’s estimate of murder victims in the United States (Year Y)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Sum of the first stage weights of all states(Year Y)

The third step in the process is to calculate the final annual victim-
level SHR weight. The weight used to develop national estimates of the 
attributes of murder victims is— 

SHR weight(Year Y) = (first stage weight(Year Y)) X (second stage 
weight(Year Y))

Conceptually, the first stage weight uses a state’s own reported SHR 
records to represent all murder victims in that state, as long as at 
least 50% of the estimated number of murder victims in that state has a 
record in the SHR. The sum of the first stage weights then equals the sum 
of the total number of all murder victims in states with at least 50% SHR 
coverage and the simple count of those victims from the other reporting 
states. The second stage weight is used to inflate the first stage 
weights so that the weight derived from the product of the first and 
second stage weights represents all murder victims in that year in the 
United States. The difference between the sum of the first stage weights 
and the FBI’s annual national estimate of murder victims is the 
unreported murder victims in states with less than 50% SHR coverage and 
the murder victims in states that report no data to the SHR in that year. 
The second stage weight compensates for this difference by assuming that 
the attributes of the nonreported victims are similar to the attributes 
of weighted murder victims in that year’s SHR database. 

The weighting procedure outlined above assumes that the characteristics 
of unreported homicide incidents are similar to the characteristics of 
reported incidents. There is no comprehensive way to assess the validity 
of this assumption.
 
Reporting on victim race and ethnicity 
***************************************

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) established standards for 
federal statistical agencies regarding the reporting of data on race and 
ethnicity. These standards indicate that data collections should include 
a minimum of five categories on race (American Indian or Alaska Native; 
Asian; black or African American; Native Hawaiian or other Pacific 
Islander; and white) and two categories on ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino, 
and non-Hispanic or Latino). Data on race submitted to the FBI for the 
SHR include four categories on race, as the data collection form used by 
local law enforcement agencies to submit homicide data combines the two 
categories of Asian and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander into 
one category. The SHR data collection form allows for the reporting of 
information on victim ethnicity; however, on average from 1992 to 2011, 
more than 98% of homicide victims for whom data were reported to the SHR 
were missing information on ethnicity. Due to the lack of reporting of 
ethnicity by submitting law enforcement agencies, homicide rates by 
Hispanic or Latino origin were not calculated. 

Missing information on victim age, sex, and race
************************************************

In general, SHR data are missing very little information on the age, sex, 
or race of homicide victims. On average from 1992 to 2011, victim age was 
missing for 2% of cases, victim sex was missing for less than 1%, and 
victim race was missing for 1%. An imputation procedure was developed to 
replace the missing victim information on each SHR record. This procedure 
used available information to infer the missing victim characteristics 
for incidents in which the victim and offender demographic 
characteristics and weapon information were known. Specifically, unknown 
victim data were imputed based on the profiles in known-victim cases, 
matched on victim and offender age, sex, and race, and weapon used. 

Counting multiple-victim homicides 
***********************************

Calculating the exact number of murder victims in an incident is not 
straightforward due to the way in which multiple-victim homicides are 
reported in the SHR. The FBI’s reporting guidelines permit a maximum of 
11 victims and 11 offenders on each individual homicide incident record 
in the SHR data. In those rare instances where a crime results in more 
than 11 homicides, FBI reporting guidelines state that homicide victim 
information should be distributed across more than one incident record, 
with the offender information repeated on each. However, these guidelines 
are not always followed. 

For example, in April 2007, a student at Virginia Polytechnic Institute 
killed 32 persons. Victim information for this homicide incident in the 
FBI’s 2007 SHR data file was allocated across four separate incident 
records. Three of the records held information on 10 victims, and the 
fourth record held information on two victims. These four records are not 
linked in the SHR file. Without knowing that these four records represent 
a single homicide incident, an analysis of the SHR data would conclude 
that there were three incidents with 10 victims each and one incident 
with two victims. 

These reporting patterns make it difficult to accurately calculate the 
number of multiple homicides or mass murders in the United States in any 
given year, without extensive knowledge of the specific incidents. Using 
SHR data and other sources of information, BJS is working to establish a 
list of mass murders that have occurred since 1980. Once this task is 
completed, BJS will produce a modified SHR data file that links together 
records from the same incident so that analysts will be able to document 
more precisely trends in mass murders in the United States.
 
Additional methodological considerations 
*****************************************

The methodology used for this report differs slightly from the 
methodology used in past BJS reports on homicide. Therefore, the data 
presented in this report should not be considered comparable to prior BJS 
homicide publications (see the Homicide Trends in the United States 
series). In addition, due to concerns regarding the representativeness of 
offender information contained in the SHR data, information on homicide 
offending rates and homicide offender characteristics have not been 
included in this report. For more information, see “Missing information 
on homicide offenders” on page 6. 

Furthermore, many of the variables examined in this report may be related 
to one another and to other variables not included in the analyses. 
Complex relationships among variables were not fully explored in this 
report and warrant more extensive analysis. Readers are cautioned not to 
draw causal inferences based on the results presented.

Alternative sources of national homicide statistics 
***************************************************

In addition to the FBI’s Supplementary Homicide Reports, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects data on homicides in the 
United States, obtained via death certifications, through the National 
Vital Statistics System (NVSS). The two sources provide somewhat 
different estimates of the annual number of homicides and their 
characteristics. Some of these differences can be attributed to 
differences in the focus of the two collections. For example, currently 
the SHR captures information on all murders known to law enforcement that 
occur in the United States, including homicide involving victims who were 
not U.S. residents, while the NVSS collects information from death 
certificates on the homicides of all U.S. residents, including deaths of 
U.S. residents that occurred in other countries. These and other coverage 
differences help to explain the differences found in statistics generated 
from the two data sources. For additional information on the two sources 
of national data on homicide, see page 2 of this report.
