Highlights

Number of HIV-Infected inmates steadily decreasing 
since 1999

*  Between 2002 and 2003 the number of HIV-positive
prisoners decreased less than 1%, while the overall
prison population grew 1.6% during the same period.

*  At yearend 2003, 2.8% of all female State prison
inmates were HIV positive, compared to 1.9% of males.

*  During 2003, 29 States reported a decrease in the
number of HIV-positive prisoners, and 14 States and 
the Federal system reported an increase.

*  New York held about a fifth of all inmates(5,000
inmates) known to be HIV positive at yearend 2003.

*  Florida, with an increase of 264 HIV-positive 
inmates, reported the largest increase, followed 
by the Federal system (up 84). New Jersey, with 99 
fewer HIV-positive inmates, reported the largest 
drop.

Rate of AIDS-related deaths in State prisons 
decreased in 2003

*  The overall rate of confirmed AIDS among the 
prison population (0.51%) was more than 3 times 
the rate in the U.S. general population (0.15%).

*  In 2003, 282 prisoners died from AIDS-related 
causes -- 268 State inmates and 14 Federal 
inmates.

*  The number of AIDS-related deaths in State 
prisons decreased 73% from 1995 to 2003.

*  Through a combination of death data from both
National Prisoner Statistics and the Deaths in 
Custody Reporting Program, 55 additional AIDS-
related deaths were identified for 2003.
----------------------------------------------

On December 31, 2003, 2.0% of State prison inmates
and 1.1% of Federal prison inmates were known to be
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Correctional authorities reported that 22,028 State
inmates and 1,631 Federal inmates were HIV positive.
The number known to be HIV positive totaled 23,659,
down from 23,864 at yearend 2002.

Of those known to be HIV positive in all U.S. 
prisons at yearend 2003, an estimated 5,944 were 
confirmed AIDS cases, up from 5,643 in 2002. 
Among State inmates, 0.5% had AIDS; among Federal 
inmates, 0.4%.

During 2003, 268 State prisoners died from AIDS-
related causes, down from 283 in 2002. In 2003,
8% of State inmate deaths were attributed to AIDS,
down from 32% in 1995. Among Federal prisoners 14
died from AIDS-related causes, down 3 deaths from 
the total in 2002.

This report is based on the 2003 National Prisoners
Statistics(NPS-1) and the Deaths in Custody 
Reporting Program (DCRP). Data from NPS-1 are 
reported on one form by the departments of 
corrections in 50 States and by the Federal Bureau 
of Prisons. DCRP data are from individual records 
for each death. A record includes information on 
the deceased's characteristics such as gender, age, 
and race/ Hispanic origin.

----------------------------------------
Number of HIV-infected prison inmates 
at yearend 2003, down from 2002

At yearend 2003, 23,659 inmates in State and Federal
prisons were known to be infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), down from 23,864 in
2002. Among State prison inmates, 22,028 were known
to be HIV positive; among Federal inmates, 1,631. 

HIV-infected inmates were concentrated in a small
number of States. New York (5,000), Florida (3,112),
and Texas (2,460) held the largest number of
HIV-positive inmates. These three States housed 
nearly half (48.0%) of all HIV-infected inmates in 
State prisons in 2003. 

New York has estimated the number of HIV-infected
inmates using data obtained through blinded sero-
prevalence studies conducted biennially by the
New York Department of Health.* ** Footnote: New 
York draws blood from all entering inmates. Every 
other year an extra sample from 1,000 sequential 
receptions in each of 4 reception centers is tested 
for various diseases including HIV. The percentage 
with HIV-infection is applied to the total inmate 
population and then adjusted for length of stay and 
findings from other studies. Projections are made 
for the interim years without the blinded studies.
***  The trend in HIV-infection among prisoners is 
affected by these estimated numbers in New York. 
Excluding New York, the number of HIV-infected 
inmates has been stable among the other States. 
Between 1998 and 2003 the number has fluctuated 
between 18,180 and 19,333.
--------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
HIV-positive inmates comprised 2.0% of the State 
prison population in 2003, unchanged since 2001. 
In Federal prisons HIV-positive inmates comprised 
1.1% in 2003. Overall, the percentage of the total 
prison population with HIV has remained constant 
at 1.9% since 2001. Inmates in the Northeast had 
the highest rate of HIV infection

In the Northeast 4.5% of the prison population 
were known to be HIV positive in 2003, followed 
by 2.2% in the South, 1.0% in the Midwest, and 
0.7% in the West. New York had the highest 
percentage of inmates known to be HIV positive 
(7.6%), followed by Maryland (4.2%)and Florida 
(3.9%)

Vermont, North Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming reported 
fewer than 10 HIV-positive inmates in their prisons.
In 2003 every reporting jurisdiction held at least
one HIV-positive inmate. Seven States reported that
fewer than 0.5% of their inmate population were HIV
positive. 

Between 2002 and 2003, 29 States reported a decrease
in the number of HIV-positive inmates. The largest
decrease was reported in New Jersey (down 99),
followed by Connecticut (94), and Texas (68). 
Fourteen States and the Federal system reported an 
increase.  The largest increases were reported in 
Florida (up 264), the Federal system (84), North 
Carolina (38), and Rhode Island (34). 

A greater percentage of females than males 
with HIV infection 

On December 31, 2003, 19,777 male inmates and 2,115
female inmates in State prisons were known to be HIV
positive. Overall, 1.9% of male inmates and 2.8% of 
all female inmates were known to be HIV positive. New
York reported the largest numbers of male and female
HIV-positive inmates (4,570 and 430, respectively). 
The second largest numbers of HIV-positive male 
and female inmates were in Florida (2,744 and 368,
respectively), followed by Texas (2,205 and 255,
respectively). Four States (Vermont, Minnesota, 
North Dakota, and Montana) reported having no 
HIV-positive female inmates. Every reporting 
State had at least one HIV-positive male inmate.

Over 10% of all female inmates were known to be 
HIV positive in two States -- New York (14.6%), 
and Maryland (11.1%). New York (with 7.3%) was 
the only State with more than 5% of male inmates 
known to be HIV positive.
----------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------
Number of HIV-positive male and female inmates 
in State prisons declined during 2003 

In States that did not provide a breakdown of the 
number of HIV cases by gender, estimates were made 
using the data reported from the most recent year. 
Based on these yearend estimates, the number of 
HIV-infected females in State prisons decreased 
from 2,164 to 2,131 in 2003. The number of 
infected male inmates decreased from 20,273 to 
20,060 in 2003. The estimated number of both male 
and female HIV-positive inmates in State prisons 
declined after 1998. Between 1998 and 2003 the 
percentage of male HIV-positive inmates decreased 
from 2.2% to 1.8%, as the percentage of female 
inmates fell from 3.8% to 2.7%.

Confirmed AIDS cases in U.S. prisons increased
during 2003

At the end of 2003, a reported 5,227 inmates in 
U.S. prisons had confirmed AIDS, up from 4,898 
in 2002. Among those with confirmed AIDS, 4,601 
were in State prisons, and 626 were in Federal 
prisons.  

Because some States each year did not provide a
breakdown of the number of HIV cases by type of 
HIV infection, estimates of the number of 
confirmed AIDS cases were made for those States 
to provide comparable year-to-year data. Based 
on yearly estimates, the number of confirmed AIDS 
cases increased from 5,643 in 2002 to 5,944 in 
2003.

Between 1998 and 2003, 33 States and the Federal
system consistently reported the number of inmates 
with confirmed AIDS. As with the reported and 
estimated numbers, the comparable number of 
inmates with confirmed AIDS declined between 
1998 and 2003, from 5,864 to 4,956.
---------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------
Confirmed AIDS cases made up 0.5% of inmates in
State prisons and 0.4% of those in Federal prisons. 
Of those known to be HIV-positive inmates, more 
than a fifth had confirmed AIDS.

The States with the largest number of confirmed AIDS
cases were New York (800), Texas (778), and Florida
(711). Combined, these States held nearly half of all
confirmed AIDS cases in State prisons. The Federal
system held 626 inmates with confirmed AIDS. Eleven
States reported having fewer than 10 confirmed AIDS
cases in their prisons; 5 reported having none.

Rhode Island (1.5%) had the highest percentage of
confirmed AIDS, followed by Connecticut and New 
York (both 1.2%). In 12 States confirmed AIDS 
cases comprised 0.1% or less of State inmates. 

During 2003, 16 States reported a decrease in the
number of confirmed AIDS cases. Illinois, with a
decrease of 73, had the largest drop in the number 
of confirmed AIDS cases, followed by New York and
Connecticut (both down 60). Seventeen States and 
the Federal system reported an increase in the 
number of confirmed AIDS cases, led by Texas(up 
219) and Florida (191).

Rate of confirmed AIDS 3 times higher among prison 
inmates than in the U.S. general population

In every year since 1991, the rate of confirmed AIDS
has been higher among prison inmates than in the
general population. At yearend 2003 the rate of con-
firmed AIDS in State and Federal prisons was more 
than 3 times higher than in the total U.S. 
population. About 51 in every 10,000 prison inmates 
had confirmed AIDS, compared to 15 in 10,000 persons 
in the U.S. general population.

AIDS-related deaths in State prisons dropped 
from 1995 to 2003
 
The number of State inmates who died of Pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia, Kaposi's sarcoma, or other
AIDS-related diseases peaked in 1995 and steadily
decreased until 2001. According to data reported in 
the NPS-1, the number of AIDS-related deaths (213) 
was slightly less than that in 2002 (215). Overall, 
after 1995 the number of AIDS-related deaths was 
down 797 from 1,010 in 1995 to 213 in 2003.
----------------------------------------------
 
Among Federal inmates 14 died from AIDS-related
causes, down from 17 in 2002. In 2003 for every
100,000 inmates, 8 died from AIDS-related causes.
These AIDS-related deaths accounted for 4% of all
deaths in Federal prison.

The introduction of protease inhibitors and 
combination antiretroviral therapies produced a 
substantial improvement in the effectiveness of 
HIV/AIDS care. See Hammett and Harmon, "Medical 
Treatment and a Continuum of Care" in 1996-1997 
Update: HIV/AIDS, STDs and TB in Correctional 
Facilities (July 1999, NCJ 176344). 

DCRP identifies more States with AIDS-related
deaths in State prisons

Pursuant to the Death in Custody Reporting Act 
of 2000, BJS began in 2001 to collect individual-
level information about deaths in State prisons 
(DCRP). Overall, 12 States under-reported AIDS-
related deaths in the NPS-1 collection, while 
11 States under-reported AIDS-related deaths in 
DCRP.

For a total of AIDS-related deaths in prisons, 
DCRP and NPS-1 data were combined. The most 
complete data for each State's number of deaths 
were used to calculate the totals for 2001, 2002, 
and 2003. An additional 55 AIDS-related deaths 
were identified in 2003,68 in 2002, and 55 in 
2001. Adjusted for under-reporting, the number 
of AIDS-related deaths in 2003 was 21 per
100,000 State prison inmates, down from 22 in 
2002. 

For the general population the percentage of 
deaths due to AIDS increased in 2001 but 
declined in 2002. In 2002 the percentage of 
deaths due to AIDS was more than 2 times higher 
in the prison population than in the U.S.
general population ages 15-54. About 1 in every 
11 prisoner deaths were attributable to AIDS-
related causes compared to 1 in 23 deaths in 
the general population.

About 1 in 12 deaths in State prisons 
due to AIDS-related illnesses

In 2003 for every 100,000 State inmates, 21 died 
from AIDS-related causes. The most AIDS deaths 
were reported in the South (157), followed by 
the Northeast (63). Together, these two regions 
accounted for more than 8 out of 10 AIDS-related 
deaths in State prisons.

Florida reported the largest number of AIDS-
related deaths (42), followed by New York and 
Texas (27). Eighteen States reported having no 
AIDS-related deaths.

Relative to the number of inmates, Delaware had 
the highest rate of AIDS-related deaths (87 per 
100,000 inmates), followed by Maryland (54 per 
100,000), Florida (52 per 100,000), and Vermont 
(50 per 100,000).

AIDS-related deaths reported in DCRP show
variations by gender, race/Hispanic origin, 
and age 

Of the 210 reported inmate deaths due to AIDS-
related causes in 2003, 202 were deaths of 
males, and 8 were deaths of females. Inmates 
between ages 35 and 44 accounted for almost half 
of all AIDS-related deaths (97). AIDS-related 
deaths among black inmates (146) accounted for 
more than two-thirds of all AIDS-related deaths. 

Relative to the total number of inmates under 
State jurisdiction at midyear 2003, males (18 
deaths per 100,000) were nearly twice as likely 
as females (10 per 100,000) to die from AIDS-
related causes. Black inmates (27 per 100,000) 
were about 3½ times more likely than whites (8 
per 100,000) and almost 2½ times more likely 
than Hispanics (12 per 100,000) to die from
AIDS-related causes. Inmates age 45 or older 
had the highest rates of AIDS-related death 
(36 per 100,000), 4 times the rate among those 
age 25 to 34 (9 per 100,000).

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The National Prisoner Statistics series 
(NPS-1) includes yearend counts of prisoners 
by jurisdiction, gender, race, Hispanic origin, 
and admissions and releases during the year. 
The series consists of reports from the
departments of corrections of the 50 States 
and the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Since 1991 
respondents have indicated the circumstances 
under which inmates are tested for HIV and 
have provided the number of HIV-infected 
inmates in their custody.

AIDS in the U.S. resident population

The number of persons with confirmed AIDS in the 
U.S. general population (age 13 and over) was 
derived from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, 
yearend editions 1995-2001. For each year the 
number of active AIDS cases in the United States 
was calculated by subtracting the number of 
cumulative AIDS deaths for people age 15 or older 
at yearend from the cumulative number of total 
AIDS cases for people age 13 or older at yearend
as listed in the HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report.

The rate of confirmed AIDS cases in the U.S. 
resident population was calculated by dividing 
the annual totals for individuals with AIDS by 
the population estimates for the U.S. resident 
population of individuals 13 or older prior to 
2000 and 15 or older for 2000 and beyond.

 AIDS-related deaths in the United States

The number of AIDS-related deaths for persons age
15-54 was derived from the CDC, HIV/AIDS
Surveillance Report, yearend editions.  Deaths 
in the U.S. population for persons age 15-54 
were taken from the CDC, Monthly Vital Statistics 
Report, Vol. 42, No. 2(S); Vol. 43, No. 12;  Vol. 
43, No. 6(S); Vol. 45, No. 3(S); and Vol. 45, No. 
11(S); and from CDC, National Vital Statistics 
Report, Vol. 47, No. 9; Vol. 47, No. 25; Vol. 48, 
No. 11; Vol. 49, No. 8; and Vol. 50, No. 15.

AIDS-related deaths as a percentage of all deaths 
in the U.S. population were calculated by dividing 
the national estimate of AIDS deaths of persons 
age 15-54 by the national mortality estimates of 
persons age 15-54 in a given year. 

BJS Deaths in Custody Reporting Program

To implement the Death in Custody Reporting Act of
2000 (PL 106-297), BJS developed four quarterly 
data collections of death records: local jails 
(begun in 2000), State prisons (2001), State 
juvenile correctional agencies (2002), and State 
and local law enforcement agencies (2003). Records 
include data on the deceased's characteristics
(such as age, gender, and race/ Hispanic origin), 
criminal background (such as legal status, offenses, 
and time in custody), and the death itself (such 
as cause, time, location, and medical conditions 
and treatment).
