The total number of prisoners under the jurisdiction of Federal or State
adult correctional authorities was 1,470,045 at yearend 2003. During the
year the States added 20,370 prisoners and the Federal prison system
added 9,531 prisoners. Overall, the Nation's prison population grew
2.1%, which was less than the average annual growth of 3.4% since
yearend 1995.  

The rate of incarceration in prison at yearend 2003 was 482 sentenced
inmates per 100,000 U.S. residents -- up from 411 in 1995. About 1 in
every 109 men and 1 in every 1,613 women were sentenced prisoners
under the jurisdiction of State or Federal authorities.

Overall, the United States incarcerated 2,212,475 persons at yearend
2003.  This total represents persons held in -- 
--Federal and State prisons (1,387,848, which excludes State and Federal
prisoners in local jails)
-- territorial prisons (16,494)
-- local jails (691,301)
-- facilities operated by or exclusively for the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, formerly the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (10,323)
-- military facilities (2,165) 
-- jails in Indian country (2,006 as of midyear 2002)
-- juvenile facilities (102,338 as of October 2002).

1 in every 140 U.S. residents in prison or 
jail at yearend 2003  

On December 31, 2003, 1,387,848 inmates were in the custody of State
and Federal prison authorities, and 691,301 were in the custody of local
jail authorities. (Custody is defined on page 10.) Since yearend 2002 the
total incarcerated population has increased by 52,600, or 2.6% -- less
than the average annual increase  since 1995 (3.5%). Including inmates
in public and privately operated facilities, the number of inmates in 
State prisons increased 1.4% during 2003; the number in Federal prisons,
6.6%; and in local jails, 3.9%. 

The rate of incarceration in prison and jail was 714 inmates per 100,000
residents in 2003, up from 601 in 1995.  At yearend 2003, 1 in every 140
U.S. residents were incarcerated in State or Federal prison or a local 
jail.

U.S. prison population rose 2.1% during 2003 

In 2003 the growth in the number of inmates under State or Federal
jurisdiction (2.1%) was less than the percentage increase recorded for
2002(2.6%). (Jurisdiction is defined on page 10.) The population under
the jurisdiction of State and Federal authorities increased by 29,901 
inmates during 2003, smaller than the  increase in 2002 (up 36,112). 
Since December 31, 1995, the U.S. prison population has grown an 
average of 43,266 inmates per year (3.4%).

The Federal prison population totaled 173,059 at yearend 2003, up from 
163,528 at yearend 2002. Most of the Federal prison growth occurred in
the first half of the year (up 4.2% between January 1 and June 30). The
population rose 1.5% in the second half of 2003 -- a rate more than twice
that of State prisoners (up 0.7%).

-------------------------------------------------------------------
At yearend 2003 16,494 inmates held in U.S. Territories

The U.S. Territories and Commonwealths -- American Samoa, Guam,
Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands -- reported
16,494 inmates in the custody of their prison systems at yearend 2003,
an increase of 1.8% since 2002.
  
Prisoners with a sentence of more than 1 year totaled 12,532 (more than
three-quarters of the total territorial prison population).

Relative to the resident populations in the Territories, the rate of
incarceration was 292 prisoners per 100,000 residents. 

Of the 5 Territories, the U.S. Virgin Islands had the highest prison
incarceration rate (338 inmates per 100,000 residents), followed by 

Puerto Rico (with 301). Puerto Rico, the largest of the Territories, also
held the largest number of sentenced prisoners, 11,667 at yearend 2003.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

11 States reported increases of at least 5% during 
2003; 11 States had decreases 

Between January 1 and December 31, 2003, North Dakota experienced
the largest increase in prison populations (up 11.4%), followed by
Minnesota (10.3%), Montana (up 8.9%), and Wyoming (up 7.8%). Eleven
States experienced a decline. Connecticut had the largest decline (down
4.2%), followed by New York (down 2.8%), Michigan (down 2.4%), and
New Jersey (down 2.3%). In absolute numbers of inmates, 4 jurisdictions
grew by at least 2,000 inmates during 2003. The Federal system (up
9,531), experienced the largest growth, followed by Texas (up 4,908),
Florida (up 4,384), and California (up 3,126). New York and Michigan had
a drop of at least 1,000 inmates (down 1,867 and 1,233, respectively). 

Overall, the number of inmates under jurisdiction in the West grew 2.9%,
followed by those in the South (2.2%) and the Midwest (0.8%). The
number of inmates declined in the Northeast (down 1.5%). In the same
period the Federal system grew 5.8%.

The prison incarceration rate reached 482 
per 100,000 residents in 2003, up from 411 
in 1995

Eleven States exceeded the national prison incarceration rate of 482 per
100,000 residents, led by Louisiana (801), Mississippi (768), Texas (702),and Oklahoma (636). Nine States, including Maine (149), Minnesota
(155), and North Dakota (181), had rates that were less than half the
national rate.
 
Since 1995 the sentenced inmate population in State prisons has averaged 
a growth of 3.3% per year.  During this period 15 States had an average 
annual growth of at least 5%, led by North Dakota (up 9.8%), Oregon 
(up 8.7%), and West Virginia (up 8.3%). Between 1995 and 2003 the 
Federal system grew an average of 7.7% per year, an average annual 
increase of 8,532 inmates.

The number of female prisoners 
increased 3.6% --  higher than that 
of men, 2.0% -- during 2003

During 2003 the number of women under the jurisdiction of State or
Federal prison authorities increased by 3.6%. The number of men in 
prison rose 2.0%. At yearend 2003, 101,179 women and 1,368,866 men
were in prison. Since 1995 the annual rate of growth of the female 
inmate population averaged 5.0%, higher than the 3.3% increase in 
male inmate population. By yearend 2003 women accounted for 6.9% 
of all prisoners, up from 6.1% in 1995 and 5.7% in 1990.  

Relative to their number in the U.S. resident population, men were 
almost 15 times more likely than women to be incarcerated in a State 
or Federal prison. At yearend 2003 there were 62 sentenced female 
inmates per 100,000 women in the United States, compared to 915 
sentenced male inmates per 100,000 men.

Since 1995 the total number of male prisoners has grown 29%; the number 
of female prisoners, 48%. At yearend 2003, 1 in every 1,613 women and 1 
in every 109 men were incarcerated in a State or Federal prison.

Over a third of female prisoners held 
in the 3 largest jurisdictions

Texas (13,487), the Federal system (11,635), and California (10,656)
held more than a third of all female inmates. Mississippi (134 sentenced
female inmates per 100,000 female residents), Oklahoma (127), and
Louisiana (104) had the highest female incarceration rates. States with
the lowest female incarceration rates were concentrated in the Northeast
-- Rhode Island (10 sentenced female prisoners per 100,000 female
residents), Massachusetts (12), and Maine and New Hampshire (both
with 18). 

Twelve States had an average annual increase of more than 10% between 
1995 and 2003, led by North Dakota (18.5%), Montana (17.9%), and Maine
(16.7%). During this period the State female prison population
increased an average of 4.9% per year; the Federal female prison
population increased  5.8% per year.

Privately operated prisons held 6.5% 
of State and Federal inmates in 2003

At yearend 2003, 30 States and the Federal system reported a total of
95,649 prisoners held in privately operated facilities. Private facilities held 5.7% of all State prisoners and 12.6% of Federal prisoners. Among States,Texas (with 16,570 State inmates housed in private facilities) and Oklahoma (with 6,022) reported the largest number in 2003. 

Six States had at least 25% of their prison population housed in private
prisons, led by New Mexico (44%),  Alaska (31%), Montana (29%), and
Oklahoma and Wyoming (both 26%). Except for Wisconsin (with over 8%
of its State inmates in private facilities) and New Jersey (nearly 10%), 
the use of private facilities was concentrated among Southern and Western States. At yearend 2003, 8.2% of State inmates in the South and 6.0% in the West were in privately operated facilities, compared to 1.8% in the Northeast and 2.0% in the Midwest. 

Since yearend 2000 the number of Federal inmates held in private
facilities has increased nearly 42%, while the number held in State
facilities has decreased 1.8%. As a percentage of all inmates under 
State and Federal jurisdiction, the number held in private facilities 
has remained stable (6.5%).  

In 2003 local jails held 5% of State 
and Federal prisoners 

At the end of 2003, 32 States and the Federal system reported a total of
73,343 State and Federal prisoners held in local jails or other facilities operated by county or local authorities.  These inmates held in local jails represented 5% of all prisoners in 2003.  

Louisiana had the largest percentage of its State inmate population
housed in local jails (46%). Four other States -- led by Tennessee (25%)
and Kentucky (24%) -- had at least a fifth of their population housed in
local jail facilities.

Over four-fifths of prisoners held in local jails were in the South 
(60,810).  Overall, the South held 10.3% of prisoners in local jails, 
followed by the West (1.7%), the Northeast (1.1%), and the Midwest 
(1.0%).

From yearend 2000 to 2003 the number of Federal inmates held in local
jails rose 34.5%, while the number of State inmates in local jails rose
15.4%. Combined, the number of State and Federal inmates held in local
jails grew by 10,203 (up 16.2%). 

23 States and Federal system operate 
at or above highest capacity

To estimate the capacity of their prisons, jurisdictions were asked to 
supply three measures for capacity at yearend 2003: rated, operational,
and design capacities. These measures were defined as follows:

Rated capacity is the number of beds or inmates assigned by a rating
official to institutions within the jurisdiction.

Operational capacity is the number of inmates that can be accommodated, 
based on a facility's staff, existing programs, and services.

Design capacity is the number of inmates that planners or architects
intended for the facility. 

Twenty-three jurisdictions gave only 1 measure or the same figure for
each measure. For the 28 jurisdictions with more than 1 reported type of
capacity, estimates of population as a percent of capacity are based on
the highest and lowest figures provided.

At yearend 2003, 27 States reported that they were operating below
100% of their highest capacity, and 22 States and the Federal prison
system reported operating at 100% or more of their highest capacity.
Mississippi, operating at 73% of its highest capacity, reported the 
lowest percent of capacity occupied. Alabama, 109% over lowest 
reported capacity, had the highest percent of capacity occupied. 

At yearend 2003 the Federal prison system was operating at 39% over
capacity. Overall, State prisons were operating between 100% of their
highest capacity and 16% above their lowest capacity.

U.S. prison population is aging

The Nation's prison population is becoming more middle-aged. In 2003
an estimated 388,700 sentenced inmates were between the ages of 40
and 54, compared to 236,000 in 1995. By yearend 2003, 28% of all
inmates were in this age group, up from 22% in 1995. The rise in the
number of inmates has been the largest among inmates age 45 to 54 (up
82,700) since 1995, followed by inmates age 40 to 44 (up 70,000).  
Combined, inmates between the ages of 40 and 54 accounted for more 
than 46% of the total growth in the U.S. prison population since 1995.

Expressed in terms of percent change, the oldest age group, inmates age
55 or older, recorded the largest change -- an increase of 85% since
1995. Despite this rapid growth, the number of inmates age 55 or older
relative to inmates in other age groups remains small, accounting for
4.3% of all inmates in 2003, up from 3.0% in 1995.

An estimated 2,800 sentenced inmates were under age 18 on December
31, 2003, down from 4,800 at yearend 1995. Overall, fewer than 0.2% of
all sentenced prisoners were under age 18 at yearend 2003. (For total
counts, see Prison and Jail Inmates at Midyear 2003, NCJ 203947.)

Underlying the increasing age of inmates has been a gradual rise in the
age of State inmates at time of admission compounded by a sharp
increase in time served in prison. In 2002 (the latest available data), 
the mean age of sentenced State inmates at time of admission was 33,
compared with 31 in 1995, and the average time served among released
inmates was 30 months, compared with 23 months in 1995. 

-----------------------------------------------------
Prisoners held by military authorities dropped 8.9% 

There were 2,165 prisoners under military jurisdiction at yearend 2003.
Fifty-eight percent of the prisoners held by the Army, Air Force, Navy,
Marine Corps, and Coast Guard had sentences of 1 year or more. At
yearend 2003 the Army's Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth,
Kansas, and five other local or regional Army facilities held the largest share of inmates under military jurisdiction (45%). The 11 Navy facilities held nearly 30% of all inmates; the 6 Marine Corps facilities held 20% of all inmates; and the 34 Air Force facilities held 5% of all inmates.

The operational capacity of the 57 military confinement facilities totaled 3,348 (not shown in a table). At yearend 2003 these facilities were operating at 65% of their operational capacity. About 87% of prisoners held by the Army,  Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps were convicted inmates; 13% were unconvicted persons.
------------------------------------------------------

More black males than white males among State and 
Federal inmates at yearend 2003

At yearend 2003 black inmates represented an estimated 44% of all
inmates with sentences of more than 1 year, while white inmates
accounted for 35% and Hispanic inmates, 19%. 

Although the total number of sentenced inmates rose sharply (up 30%
between 1995 and 2003), there were small changes in the racial and
Hispanic composition of the inmate population.

At yearend 2003 black males (586,300) outnumbered white males
(454,300) and Hispanic males (251,900) among inmates with sentences
of more than 1 year. More than 44% of all sentenced male inmates were
black. 

White females (39,107) outnumbered black females (35,050) and
Hispanic females (16,172). About 42% of all sentenced female inmates
were white.

-------------------------------------------------------------
The number of Immigration and Customs detainees 
rose nearly 12% during 2003 

The U.S. Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE),
formerly the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS),
reported 23,514 detainees on December 31, 2003, up from 21,065 at
yearend 2002.  Nearly two-thirds of these detainees (15,044) were
held in Federal and State prisons and local jails, and about a third
were held in ICE-operated facilities (5,109) and private facilities 
under exclusive contract to the ICE (1,935).

The number of detainees under ICE jurisdiction nearly tripled between
1995 and 2003. This increase most affected State prisons, local jails, 
and other facilities maintaining intergovernmental agreements with ICE; 
they held 15,044 detainees in 2003, up from 2,286 in 1995. 

Among the 23,514 ICE detainees for immigration violations at yearend
2003, 12,603 had been convicted of criminal offenses, and 1,961 had
pending criminal cases (not shown in table). Detainees convicted of
violent offenses (31.7%) and drug offenses (29.5%) constituted the
largest groups under ICE jurisdiction, followed by property offenses
(14.8%) and public-order offenses (14.7%). 
----------------------------------------------------------------

An estimated 9% of black males, age 25-29, in 
prison in 2003

When incarceration rates are estimated separately by age group, black
males in their twenties and thirties have high rates relative to other
groups. Among black males age 25 to 29, 9.3% were in prison at
yearend, compared to 2.6% of Hispanic males and about 1.1% of white
males of the same age group. Although incarceration rates drop with age,
the percentage of black males age 45 to 54 in prison in 2003 was nearly
3.5% -- higher than the highest rate (2.6%) for Hispanic males (age 25
to 29) and more than twice the highest rate (1.1%) for white males (age
25 to 29). (See Methodology for description of new estimation
procedures.)

Female incarceration rates, substantially lower than male incarceration
rates at every age, reveal similar racial and ethnic disparities. Black
females (with an incarceration rate of 185 per 100,000) were more than
twice as likely as Hispanic females (84 per 100,000) and nearly 5 times
more likely than white females (38 per 100,000) to be in prison on
December 31, 2003. These differences among white, black, and Hispanic
females were consistent across all age groups. 

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), with the U.S. Census Bureau as
its collection agent, obtains yearend and midyear counts of prisoners
from departments of correction in each of the 50 States and the Federal
Bureau of Prisons. 

The National Prisoner Statistics (NPS) distinguishes prisoners in custody from those under jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a State must hold that person in one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction means that a State has legal authority over the prisoner.  Prisoners under a State's jurisdiction may be in the custody of a local jail, another State's prison, or other correctional facility. Some States are unable to provide both custody and jurisdiction counts. 

Excluded from NPS counts are persons confined in locally administered
confinement facilities who are under the jurisdiction of local authorities. NPS counts include all inmates in State-operated facilities in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont, which have combined jail-prison systems. NPS excludes inmates held by the District of Columbia (DC), which as of yearend 2001 operated only a jail system. Counts of inmates held in DC jails are included in the Annual Survey of Jails.

Military Corrections Statistics

BJS obtains yearend counts of prisoners in the custody of U.S. military
authorities from the Department of Defense Corrections Council. In 1994
the council, comprised of representatives from each branch of military
service, adopted a standardized report (DD Form 2720) with a common
set of items and definitions. This report gives data on persons held in
U.S. military confinement facilities inside and outside the continental
United States, by branch of service, sex, race, Hispanic origin, 
conviction status, sentence length, and offense. It also has data on the
number of facilities, and their design and rated capacities.

Other inmate counts

In 1995 BJS began collecting yearend  counts of prisoners from the
departments of correction in the U.S. Territories (American Samoa,
Guam, and U.S. Virgin Islands) and U.S. Commonwealths (Northern
Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico). These counts include all sentenced
and unsentenced inmates for whom the Territory or Commonwealth
government had legal authority (inmates under jurisdiction) and all
inmates physically located in prison or jail facilities (inmates in 
custody). These counts are collected by gender, race, Hispanic origin, 
and sentence length. In addition, BJS obtains reports of the total 
design, rated, and operational capacity of correctional facilities.

Estimating age-specific incarceration rates

The number of sentenced prisoners within each group was estimated for
men, women, whites, blacks, and Hispanics. In 2003 for the first time,
estimates were produced separately for inmates under State jurisdiction
by combining data from NPS and the 2002 National Corrections
Reporting Program (NCRP). The 2002 NCRP provided updated estimates by 
age that were previously obtained from the 1997 survey of Inmates in 
State Correctional Facilities. The following procedures were
used:
1. The NCRP provided counts of State sentenced inmates by age, gender,  
race, and Hispanic origin. These counts were based on reports on
characteristics of inmates held at yearend 2002 in 25 participating
States, representing 81% of all inmates.

2. The Federal Justice Statistics Program (FJSP) provided counts of
sentenced Federal inmates by age for each demographic group at the
end of fiscal year 2002.

3. The NPS provided counts of sentenced State inmates by gender by
race and Hispanic origin at midyear 2003. These counts were then
converted to percentages and multiplied by the number of sentenced
inmates by gender to obtain estimates of the number of sentenced State
inmates on December 31. The FJSP counts were converted to
percentages and multiplied by the NPS totals at yearend 2003.

4. Estimates of the U.S. resident population for July 1, 2002, by age,
gender, race/Hispanic origin were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau. 
These data were then updated, by adjusting to national estimates by 
gender for July 1, 2003.

5. Age-specific rates of incarceration for each demographic group were
calculated by dividing the estimated number of sentenced prisoners in
each age group by the number of U.S. residents in each age group and
then multiplying by 100,000. 

NPS jurisdiction notes

Alaska -- Prisons and jails form one integrated system. All NPS data
include jail and prison populations. Counts exclude individuals in
electronic and special monitoring programs.

Arizona -- Population counts are based on custody data. Counts exclude
174 sentenced inmates housed in contracted local jail facilities, some 
awaiting transfer to the DOC.

The definition of operational capacity has changed to include temporary 
beds and double bunks used in situations of crowding.

California -- Population counts include felons and civil addicts who are
temporarily absent, such as in court, jail or hospital.

Colorado -- Population counts include 247 male and 8 female inmates in the Youthful Offender System.

secure facilities under contract with BOP or with State or local government that has an intergovernmental agreement. Custody counts exclude offenders housed under home confinement.

Rated capacity excludes contract beds.

Florida -- Population counts from December 31, 2002 based on custody
data, including inmates in privately operated facilities, and are not
comparable to 2003 numbers.
