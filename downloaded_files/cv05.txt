Errata
Criminal Victimization, 2005

June 16, 2011

The estimates published in the Criminal Victimization, 2005 bulletin were
calculated using incorrect sampling weights. Base weights for
non-self-representing primary sampling units were adjusted to more accurately
represent the 2000 sample design. The corrected weights resulted in relatively
small revisions to estimates of victimization counts and rates (table A).  See
Methodology at http://bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=dcdetail&iid=245 for a discussion
of the National Crime Victimization Survey design and weighting protocol. 

With the following exceptions, all conclusions and findings presented in
Criminal Victimization, 2005 remain unchanged:

Table 1. The change in property crime rates from 2004 to 2005 was significant
at the 90% confidence level.  The difference was originally reported
significant at the 95% level.

Table 6. The aggravated assault rate for Hispanics was higher than that for
non-Hispanics. (i.e. the difference was significant at the 95% level.)  The
report originally reported the difference as significant at the 90% level.

Table 7. The difference between the violent crime rates for never married
persons and divorced/separated persons was not statistically significant.  The
report originally reported the difference as significant at the 90% level.

The incorrect sampling weight also impacted estimates presented in the BJS
reports listed below. Errata detailing the impact are forthcoming for each of
these reports.

Highlights

The overall violent crime rate remained unchanged 
between 2004 and 2005, while the property crime
rate declined

* For most crimes, aggregated rates for the two-year period 
2004-05 were unchanged from 2002-03, while minor declines 
were seen for some forms of robbery and simple assault 
without injury.

* From 1993 to 2005, the violent crime rate was down 58%, 
from 50 to 21 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or 
older.

* During 2005, 24% of all violent crime incidents were 
committed by an armed offender, including 9% by an 
offender with a firearm.

* The rate of firearm violence increased between 2004 and 
2005, from 1.4 to 2.0 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 
12 or older.

* Males were most vulnerable to violence by strangers (54% 
of the violence against males), while females were most 
often victimized by nonstrangers (64%).

* Males, blacks, and persons age 24 or younger continued 
to be victimized at higher rates than females, whites, and 
persons age 25 or older in 2005.

* During 2005, 47% of all violent victimizations and 40% of 
all property crimes were reported to the police.
------------------------------------------------------

In 2005 U.S. residents age 12 or older experienced an
estimated 23 million violent and property victimizations, 
according to the National Crime Victimization Survey(NCVS). 
These criminal victimizations included an estimated 18 
million property crimes (burglary, motor vehicle theft,
and theft),  5.2 million violent crimes (rape or sexual
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault), 
and 227,000 personal thefts (pocket picking and purse 
snatching).

Because of a decline in the rate of theft, the overall
property crime rate declined between 2004 and 2005. 
Victimization rates for every other major type of crime 
measured by the survey were unchanged. For completed
robbery with injury and simple assault without minor injury, 
aggregate rates for the period 2004-05 were somewhat lower 
than those for 2002-03. The 1-year (2004-2005) and 2-year
(2002-03 to 2004-05) change estimates indicate that at the 
national level crime rates remain stabilized at the lowest 
overall levels experienced since 1973. 

Between 1993 (when the NCVS was redesigned) and 2005, the
violent crime rate decreased 58%, from 50 to 21 
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older. Property 
crime declined 52%, from 319 to 154 per 1,000 households.

In 2005, according to victims, 47% of violent crimes were
reported to the police, up from 43% in 1993. The proportion 
of property crimes reported to the police also increased 
to 40% in 2005, from 33% in 1993.

Criminal victimization, 2004-05

The NCVS collects data on nonfatal crimes against persons
age 12 or older, reported and not reported to the police, 
from a nationally representative sample of U.S. households. 
(See Methodology, page 11.) Information on homicide is 
obtained from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program 
of the FBI.

Crimes measured by the NCVS

Violent crimes include rape or sexual assault, robbery,
aggravated assault, and simple assault. Property crimes 
include household burglary, motor vehicle theft, and 
theft.

The overall violent crime rate remained stable between 
2004 and 2005, while the overall property crime rate 
declined due to a drop in household theft from 123 to 
116 victimizations per 1,000 households.

Murder/nonnegligent manslaughter

Based on preliminary 2005 data from the FBI, the number 
of persons murdered in the United States increased 4.8% 
between 2004 and 2005. In 2004, 16,140 persons were 
murdered; the estimate for 2005 is about 16,910 victims 
of murder. Based on these preliminary data, the homicide 
rate for 2005 is an estimated 5.7 per 100,000 individuals. 

Preliminary data suggest that while increases in the number
of murders occurred in all regions of the country, the 
greatest increases were in the Midwest (5.8%) and South 
(5.3%). 

---------------------------------------------------
Murder and victim characteristics, 2004

In 2004, the year in which the most recent comprehensive 
data are available, the FBI reported a total of 16,140 
murders or nonnegligent manslaughters. The total represented 
a 2.4% decrease from the 16,530 murders recorded in 2003. 
The FBI defines murder in its annual Crime in the United 
States as the willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human 
being by another. Justifiable homicides, attempted murder, 
and deaths caused by negligence, suicide, or accident are 
not included. The FBI's UCR program collects data on murder 
from over 17,000 city, county, and State law enforcement 
agencies.

Though the rate and level of homicide change from year to 
year, the relationship between victim characteristics and 
homicide tends to remain the same. For example, as in 
previous years, in 2004 —

* Most murder victims were male (78%).

* When the race of the murder victim was known, about half 
were white (49.8%), almost half were black (47.6%), and 
about 2.6% were of another race.

* When information on the victim-offender relationship was 
available, 77% of the offenders were known to the victim, 
while 23% were a stranger to the victim.

* Firearms were used in the majority of murders (70%).

* Offenders were most often male (90%) and age 18 or older 
(92%).

* Homicide is generally intraracial.

* Arguments were the most often cited circumstance 
leading to murder (44%).

* Homicides occurred in connection with another felony 
(such as rape, robbery, or arson) in 23% of incidents.
--------------------------------------------------

Criminal victimization, 2002-03 and 2004-05

Comparing the 2-year average annual rates, criminal
victimization changed somewhat in three sub-categories 
of crime rates from 2002-03 to 2004-05.

During this period there were indications that the average
annual rates of attempted or threatened violence, completed 
robbery with injury, and simple assault without injury 
declined somewhat from 2002-03 to 2004-05.

----------------------------------------
Estimating change in crime 
victimization rates

Since 1995 the NCVS has under-gone sample reductions 
because of the escalating costs of data collection. 
At the same time, the rate of crime remains at the 
lowest levels in the past thirty years. The 
combination of the two — fewer survey respondents and 
less crime — has resulted in a diminished ability to 
detect statistically significant year-to-year changes 
in rates.

Comparing 2-year average rates provides a picture of 
the continuing decline in some categories of crime. 
Annual detailed tables of victimization counts and 
per capita rates are located on the BJS website at
<www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cv05.htm>.
---------------------------------------

Comparing victim characteristics, 
2002-03 and 2004-05

Violent victimization rates remained unchanged from 
2002-03 to 2004-05 for most demographic categories of 
victims examined. 

Gender

Violent crime rates for females declined somewhat from
2002-03 to 2004-05. 

Marital status

Rates of violence against persons who were never married 
declined somewhat from 2002-03 to 2004-05, from 42 to 38
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older.

Age

For persons 16 to 19 years old, violent crime rates fell 
from 56 to 45 victimizations per 1,000 persons. Despite 
apparent differences, there was no detectable change for 
persons in other age groups. 

Annual household income

There are indications that the rate of violent victimization
declined for persons in households earning less than $7,500 
per year. There was no detectable change for persons in other 
income categories.

Region and location of residence

Crime rates remained stable for persons residing in all
regions of the country (Northeast, Midwest, South, and 
West). Between 2002-03 and 2004-05, violent crime 
decreased 12% for persons residing in suburban areas but 
remained unchanged in urban and rural areas. 

Comparing household 
characteristics, 2002-03 and 2004-05

Annual household income

Property crime rates were unchanged for households in 
all income categories between 2002-03 and 2004-05. 

Region, location, and homeownership

A decline of 12% in property crime rates was measured in 
the Northeast, 2002-03 to 2004-05. No difference in rates 
was observed in other regions of the country.

Despite apparent changes, rates of property crime remained
stable for households in urban (207), suburban (142), and 
rural (130) areas.

From 2002-03 to 2004-05, average annual property crime 
rates remained  stable for residential renters and 
homeowners.

--------------------------------------
Victimization trends, 1993-2005

The rate of every major violent and property crime 
measured in the NCVS — rape or sexual assault, robbery, 
aggravated assault, simple assault, burglary, theft, 
and motor vehicle theft — fell significantly between 
1993 and 2005.

Violent crime

The overall violent crime rate fell 58% from 50 to 21 
violent victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older 
between 1993 to 2005. Other significant declines were 
measured in the rates of rape or sexual assault(down 69%), 
robbery (down 57%), aggravated assault (down 64%), and 
simple assault (down 54%).

Property crime

From 1993 through 2005, the rate of overall property 
crime declined significantly, as did the rate for all 
major types of property crime. The household burglary 
rate fell 49%; the motor vehicle theft rate fell 56%; 
and the theft rate fell 52%. The declines in motor 
vehicle theft and theft were greater for attempted 
crimes than for completed crimes.
-------------------------------------

Characteristics of victims, 
1993-2005

Violent victimization declined in every demographic group
between 1993 and 2005. For males, the rate of violence 
declined 57%, from 60 to 26 victimizations per 1,000 males. 
The rate of violence against females declined by 58%, from 
41 to 17 victimizations per 1,000 females.

In 2003 new definitions for race and ethnicity were
implemented in the NCVS survey that prevent long term 
comparisons(See Methodology on page 11 for further details). 
Using these new definitions, in 2005 the rate of violence 
for whites was 20.1 per 1,000; for blacks, 27.0 per 1,000; 
and for other races (American Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, 
Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander), 13.9 per 1,000.

Violent crime rates declined 39% for victims residing in
households earning $15,000 to $24,999 per year, from 49 
to 30 victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older. 
Violent crime rates for individuals living in households 
in all other income categories declined by nearly 50% or 
more. 

Property crime rates fell for every demographic group
considered between 1993 and 2005. Households in every
region of the country experienced declines in property 
crime rates of 50% or more. Property crime rates for 
households that owned or rented their homes also showed 
a decline of at least 50%.

Households in urban areas (down 51%), suburban areas(down
54%), and rural areas (down 49%) experienced similar 
declines in property crime rates from 1993 to 2005. 

Households with annual incomes of less than $15,000
experienced smaller declines in property crime rates than 
households with annual incomes of $25,000 or more between 
1993 and 2005. 

Characteristics of violent crime 
victims, 2005

Males, blacks, and persons age 24 or younger continued 
to be victimized at higher rates than females, whites, 
and persons age 25 or older in 2005. 

Gender of victim

Males were victims of overall violent crime, robbery, 
total assault, aggravated assaults and simple assault at 
rates higher than females. Females were more likely than 
males to be victims of rape or sexual assault.

Race of victim

Blacks were victims of overall violence, rape, robbery, 
and aggravated assault at rates higher than those for 
whites in 2005. Blacks were also more likely than 
persons of other races to be victims of violence.

Beginning in 2003 survey respondents were able to self-
identify with more than one race. In 2005, persons of 
two or more races were victims of overall violence at 
significantly higher rates than whites, blacks, and 
persons of other races.

Hispanic origin of victim

Hispanics were victims of overall violence, robbery, and
aggravated assault at rates somewhat higher than those of 
non-Hispanics in 2005. Hispanics and non-Hispanics were 
equally likely to experience rape or sexual assault, 
simple assault, and theft.

Age of victim

As in previous years, there was a general pattern of
decreasing crime rates for persons of older age groups. 
Persons age 25 or older experienced lower victimization 
rates than younger individuals. Persons age 16-19 
experienced robbery at rates higher than persons in other 
age groups, except ages 20-24. 

Household income

There was a general pattern of decreasing victimization
rates for persons residing in households with higher 
incomes. Persons in households with an annual income 
under $7,500 were more likely to be victims of robbery 
and assault than members of households with incomes of 
$35,000 or more. Persons of all income categories were 
equally likely to experience rape or sexual assault.

Differences in robbery rates among persons in income
categories below $35,000 were not statistically 
significant. 

Marital status of victims

Persons who were never married experienced somewhat higher
rates of overall violence than did persons of other marital 
status categories. Persons who were married and  widowed 
were equally likely to experience rape or sexual assault. 
Persons who were married were more likely than persons who 
were divorced or separated to experience assault. Married 
and divorced or separated persons were equally likely to 
experience robbery.

Region

Despite apparent differences, persons residing in the
Midwest(3.2 per 1,000), Northeast(2.4 per 1,000), and 
West(2.7 per 1,000) were equally likely to experience 
robbery victimizations. There was some indication that 
the rate of robbery was lower in the South than in the 
Midwest.

Location of residence

Urban residents experienced overall crimes of violence,
robbery, and assault at rates higher than those for 
suburban and rural residents. Except for the crime of 
rape or sexual assault, suburban and rural residents had 
statistically similar rates of violence. 

Characteristics of households 
experiencing property crime, 2005

Annual household income

Households earning less than $7,500 per year were more
likely to experience burglary than households earning 
more than $15,000 per year. While theft rates varied 
across income levels, no patterns emerged.

Region, locality, and homeownership

Rates of overall property crime were lowest for households
in the Northeast (104 per 1,000). Households in the West 
experienced higher overall property victimization rates 
(206 per 1,000) than those in other regions. For 
households located in the South and Midwest, the rates 
of overall property crime were statistically similar. 

Northeastern households were less likely to experience
burglary than were households in other regions of the 
country. 

Western households continued to experience the highest 
rates of motor vehicle theft in 2005. Northeastern and 
Midwestern households were equally likely to experience 
motor vehicle theft.

Rates of burglary, motor vehicle theft, and household 
theft were highest for households located in urban areas. 
Suburban households were victims of motor vehicle theft 
and theft at rates higher than those of rural households. 
Rates of burglary were somewhat higher for rural 
households than for suburban households but lower than 
rates of burglary in urban areas.

In 2005 households that owned their home (137 per 1,000)
were less likely to experience all types of property 
crime than households that rented their home (192 per 
1,000). 

Characteristics of the violent 
crime incident

Victim-offender relationship

Historically, females have been most often victimized by
someone they knew, while males were more likely to be 
victimized by a stranger. This finding continued during 
2005.

Of those offenders victimizing females, 18% were described
as intimates and 34% as strangers. In contrast, of those 
offenders victimizing males, 3% were described as intimates 
and 54% as strangers. Women reported being raped or sexually 
assaulted by a friend or acquaintance in 38% of such 
victimizations. 

Presence of weapons

An estimated 24% of all violent crime incidents were
committed by an armed offender. As in previous years, 
the presence of a firearm during a violent crime was 
related to the type of crime. Three percent of rape or 
sexual assault victimizations, 7% of assault victimizations, 
and 26% of robberies were committed by an offender with a
firearm. 

Between 1993 and 2005, the overall rate of firearm violence
declined significantly from 5.9 to 2.0 victimizations per 
1,000 persons age 12 or older.

The rate of firearm violence increased between 2004 and
2005, from 1.4 to 2.0 victimizations per 1,000 individuals. 
In 2003 the rate was 1.9 per 1,000 (not shown in table). 

Reporting to the police

During 2005, 47% of all violent victimizations and 40% 
of all property crimes were reported to the police. The 
percentage of aggravated assault reported to the police
(62%) was higher than the percentage for rape or sexual 
assault (38%) and simple assault (42%). It was also 
somewhat higher than that for robbery (52%). 

Fifty-six percent of burglaries and 32% of household thefts
were reported to the police in 2005. Motor vehicle theft 
was the property crime most frequently reported to the 
police(83%).

Reporting and victim characteristics

In 2005, violent crimes against females (55%) were more
likely to be reported to police than crimes against males 
(42%). Rates of reporting for violent victimizations did 
not differ for males or females across racial and ethnic 
categories. 

Reporting crime to the police, 
1993-2005

The percentage of violent and property crime reported to 
the police remained unchanged between 2004 and 2005. 

With the exception of rape or sexual assault and robbery,
reporting to the police of violent and property crime 
increased between 1993 and 2005. 

Aggravated assault reported to the police increased from 
54% to 62%, and simple assault reported to the police 
increased from 37% to 42% between 1993 and 2005. During 
the same period, burglary reported to the police increased 
from 50% to 56%; motor vehicle theft increased from 75% to 
83%; and theft increased from 26% to 32%.

Methodology

This Bulletin presents data on nonlethal violence and
property crimes from the National Crime Victimization 
Survey (NCVS). It also presents data on homicide from 
the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program.

Victimization rates are based on data collected during the
calendar year. In 2005, about 77,200 households and 134,000 
individuals age 12 or older were interviewed for the NCVS. 
The response rate was 90.7% of eligible households and 
84.3% of eligible individuals.

Since 2003 the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB)
guidelines mandate that individuals in household surveys 
be allowed to choose more than one racial category. In 
prior years they were asked to select a single primary 
race.

Racial categories presented in this report consist of the 
following: white only, black only, other race only (American 
Indian, Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific 
Islander if only one of these races is given), and two or 
more races (all persons of any race indicating two or more 
races).

Individuals are asked whether they are of Hispanic origin 
before being asked about their race, and are asked directly 
if they are of Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino origin.

Standard error computations

Comparisons of percentages and rates made in this report 
were tested to determine if observed differences were 
statistically significant. Differences described as higher, 
lower, or different passed a test at the 0.05 level of 
statistical significance (95% confidence level). 
Differences described as somewhat, slightly, marginally, or 
some indication  passed a test at the 0.10 level of 
statistical significance (90% confidence level). Caution is 
required when comparing estimates not explicitly discussed 
in this Bulletin.
