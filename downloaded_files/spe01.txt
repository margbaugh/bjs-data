States spent $29.5 billion for prisons in 2001, 
about a $5½ billion increase from 1996, after 
adjusting for inflation

*  Prison operations consumed about 77% of State correctional

--------------------------------------------
                                     
Correctional authorities spent $38.2 billion to maintain the Nation's 
State correctional systems in fiscal year 2001, including $29.5 
billion specifically for adult correctional facilities. Day-to-day 
operating expenses totaled $28.4 billion, and capital outlays for
land, new building, and renovations, 1.1 billion.
                                     
The average annual operating cost per State inmate in 2001 was 
$22,650, or $62.05 per day. Among facilities operated by the 
Federal Bureau of Prisons, it was $22,632 per inmate, or $62.01 
per day.                                 
In a followup to a study based on FY 1996 data, this report 
presents unique statistics on the cost of operating State
prisons in FY 2001. Information was obtained by extracting 
corrections data from each State's responses to the U.S. 
Census Bureau's annual Survey of Government Finances. Item
categories were standardized across jurisdictions, and 
reported figures were verified with State budget officials.
                                     
Expenditures are the total amounts paid for prison operations, 
including interest on indebtedness. Figures are net of amounts 
derived from revenue-generating activities such as farm and 
industrial production and services.
                                     
The increase in cost of corrections outpaced 
the cost of health, education, or natural 
resources

State spending for corrections increased from $65 per resident 
in 1986 to $134 in 2001. Per capita expenditures for State 
prison operations alone rose from $49 in 1986 to $104 in 2001.  

At an average annual increase of 6.2% for total State correctional 
spending and 6.4% specifically for prisons, increases in the cost 
of adult incarceration outpaced those of health care (5.8%), 
education (4.2%), and natural resources (3.3%).

Although correctional spending grew at a faster rate than many 
other State payments between 1986 and 2001, it remained one of 
the smaller cost items. For example, the outlay for education, 
at $374.5 billion, was nearly 10 times larger, and that for 
welfare, at $260.3 billion, was nearly 7 times larger.

State correctional expenditures include the cost of operating
 prisons and related institutions. Such institutions are 
reformatories; prison farms; centers for the reception, 
evaluation, and classification of inmates; and correctional 
facilities exclusively for the criminally insane or for the 
treatment of drug and alcohol addiction. State correctional 
expenditures are primarily for operating adult facilities. 
Other spending pays for juvenile correctional activities, 
adult parole boards and programs (including court programs),
and correctional administration not associated with specific 
penal institutions.

States spent $29.5 billion on prisons
in fiscal 2001

State prison expenditures totaled $29.5 billion in fiscal year 
2001. Adjusted for inflation, this was approximately $5.5
billion more than was spent in FY 1996.

California reported the largest prison expenditure, $4.2 
billion, and North Dakota the smallest, $26.8 million.

As a non-State activity, correctional spending by the Federal 
Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was outside the scope of this report. 
However, outlays for its operations in FY 2001 amounted to
$3.8 billion, or about 11% of the Nation's prison expenditure.
     
Operating costs averaged $22,650
per inmate in fiscal year 2001 

State prison operating expenditures totaled $28.4 billion in 
fiscal year 2001. This total, divided by the number of
prisoners, produced a nationwide average annual operating 
cost per inmate of $22,650. Adjusted for inflation, the 
equivalent figure in 1996 was $22,515. 
 
The average operating cost to incarcerate one inmate in the 
Federal Bureau of Prisons system during FY 2001 was $22,632.
 
The $28.4 billion State operating cost, divided by the U.S. 
resident population, resulted in a nationwide average 
operating expenditure of $100 per person. The highest costs 
per resident were recorded in the District of Columbia
($251), Alaska ($243), and Delaware ($204). The lowest costs 
per resident were in West Virginia ($34), North Dakota ($38), 
and New Hampshire and Minnesota ($48 each). 

State correctional systems with integrated jail-prison facilities 
may have higher operating costs than other jurisdictions because 
the costs of housing jail inmates are included as State 
expenditures. Of the six States with integrated jail-prison 
systems in 2001, four had average annual operating costs per 
resident above the average for States not operating integrated 
systems. 

Compared to 1996, prison spending
in 2001 revealed a greater emphasis
on facility operation 

Over three-fourths of the States spent 96% or more of prison funds 
on current operations such as salaries, wages, benefits, supplies,
maintenance, and contractual services. In 1996 State spending on 
current operations accounted for 94% of total expenditures.

The District of Columbia, Hawaii, Alaska, Tennessee, and Utah 
allocated all or nearly all prison expenditures to current 
operating activities. By contrast, Nebraska spent the lowest 
proportion (79%), followed by Missouri (83%), Wisconsin (84%), 
and Wyoming (86%).

Salaries, wages, and benefits made up about two-thirds of State 
prison operating expenditures, nationwide, in 2001. Other
operating costs comprised about a third. Other operating costs 
covered a wide variety of outlays, such as inmate health care, 
food, utilities, supplies, fees, commissions, and contractual 
services.

A majority of States spent 4% or less of
prison expenditures on capital projects

Thirty-seven jurisdictions used 4% or less of all prison dollars 
to finance new construction, renovations, major repairs,
equipment, land, buildings, and other nonrecurring outlays during 
FY 2001. Among this group, the District of Columbia, Alaska, Hawaii, 
and Utah spent less than 1%. Four other States allocated significant
proportions of prison funds to capital projects: Nebraska (21%), 
Missouri (17%), Wisconsin (16%), and Wyoming (14%).

Spending on State prison capital
projects decreased 25% from 1996
to 2001

Total capital expenditures of State prisons, adjusted for 
inflation, declined 25% from $1.5 billion in FY 1996 to
$1.1 billion in FY 2001.

-----------------------------------------------
Many factors associated with
variation in prison costs

Much of the variation between States in the cost of operating 
prisons was outside the influence of correctional officials: 
differences in the cost of living, variation in prevailing 
wage rates, climate, and other factors. Although important, 
they were beyond the scope of this study.   

However, certain corrections-related factors were possible to 
analyze. For example, employee salaries, wages, and benefits 
consumed more than half of prison operating expenditures. 
Their influence was measurable by comparing inmate-to-staff 
ratios with operating costs per inmate. High inmate-to-staff 
ratios were most common in States reporting low average costs 
per inmate, and low inmate-to-staff ratios predominated in
States with high average annual costs per inmate.

Cost savings may also have been made from the operation of 
larger capacity prisons. Eight of the 10 States with average 
annual operating expenditures per inmate over $30,000 had an 
average number of inmates per facility under 800. By contrast, 
3 of the 7 States with average annual operating expenditures 
per inmate under $15,000 had an average number of inmates per
facility over 800.  

Transfer payments, which included intergovernmental monies 
from one government to another as well as intra-governmental 
payments from one department or agency to another, varied 
significantly by State. In the 1996 State prison expenditure 
study, when these payments were last identified separately, 
departments of corrections in the South received about 8% of 
their total expenditures from transfer payments, compared to 
about 4% in other regions.
-------------------------------------------   

More than three-fourths of State prison capital expenditures were 
for new construction, renovations, and major repairs, including 
fees and services of architects, engineers, appraisers, and
attorneys. In FY 2001 these components consumed nearly the 
entire capital account in Missouri (99%) and Washington (97%).

The second-largest capital expenditure was for equipment purchases 
and installations, including furnishings, office equipment, motor 
vehicles, and other devices having a useful life of more than 5 
years. The average outlay was approximately 23% of total capital 
spending. In Alaska, Delaware, Nevada, and Utah, however, equipment
accounted for the entire capital spending category in FY 2001. 

The purchase of land, rights-of-way, existing structures, title 
searches, and related costs (not shown in table 4)included less 
than half of 1% of State prison capital expenditures, nationwide.
Four States reported outlays in this category that exceeded 2%: 
Oregon (4.6%), New Mexico (3.9%), Florida (3.4%), and Arkansas 
(2.3%).

Over a quarter of prison operating
costs for basic living expenses

Prisoner medical care, food service, utilities, and contract 
housing totaled $7.3 billion, or about 26% of State prison 
current operating expenses. 

Inmate medical care totaled $3.3 billion, or about 12% of 
operating expenditures. Supplies and services of government 
staff and full-time and part-time managed care and fee-for-
service providers averaged $2,625 per inmate, or $7.19 per 
day. By comparison, the average annual health care 
expenditure of U.S. residents, including all sources in FY
2001, was $4,370, or $11.97 per day.***Footnote: U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services, National Center for
health Statistics, citing Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services in Health, United States, 2003, table 116.***

Five States reported annual medical costs per inmate above 
$4,000: Maine ($5,601), New Mexico ($4,665), California 
($4,394), Massachusetts ($4,049), and Alaska ($4,047). 
Three States spent less than $1,000 per inmate: Louisiana 
($860), Montana ($922), and Kentucky ($960).

Factors beyond the scope of this report contributed to the 
variation in spending levels for prisoner medical care.
Lacking economies of scale, some States had significantly 
higher than average medical costs for everyone, and some 
had higher proportions of inmates whose abuse of drugs or
alcohol had led to disease. Also influencing variations in 
expenditures were staffing and funding of prisoner health 
care and distribution of specialized medical equipment for
prisoner treatment.

Food service in FY 2001 cost $1.2 billion, or approximately 4% 
of State prison operating expenditures.  

As a percentage of total prison operating costs, South Dakota 
and Hawaii allocated the largest proportions to food services, 
11.3% and 8.2%, respectively, and North Carolina and Oregon 
allocated the smallest proportions, 0.7% and 1.8%.  

On average nationwide, State departments of correction spent 
$2.62 to feed inmates each day. Pennsylvania ($5.69) and 
Washington ($5.68) reported the largest amounts, followed by 
Maine ($5.03), Hawaii ($4.87), and Iowa ($4.81). North
Carolina indicated the lowest cost ($0.52), followed by 
Alabama ($0.72), Mississippi ($0.81), and Louisiana ($0.96).   

Reports of low food costs often reflected prisoner-operated farm 
and food processing operations.  or example, Mississippi State
Penitentiary, Parchman, and South Mississippi State Penitentiary,
Leakesville, grew a wide variety of fruits, vegetables and grains, 
and raised livestock for other Mississippi prisons.  Prison 
enterprises in North Carolina operated a cannery, a meat
processing plant, warehouses, and trucks to deliver food and 
equipment to correctional facilities statewide.

Utility services for electricity, natural gas, heating oil, water, 
sewerage, trash removal, and telephone in State prisons totaled 
$996 million in FY 2001. 

Utilities accounted for about 3.5% of State prison operating 
expenditure. Among individual States, they consumed the most 
in Alabama (5.7%), New Hampshire and Virginia (5.6%), and the 
least in Rhode Island (0.5%), and Montana (1.5%).

Daily utility costs ranged from a high of $5.43 per inmate in 
Massachusetts, $4.52 in Alaska, and $4.50 in Maine to a low of 
$0.55 in Rhode Island, $0.89 in Louisiana, and $0.92 in
Montana. 

40 State correctional systems paid
others to house some prisoners 

All but 11 States had expenses relating to the contract housing 
of prison inmates in private facilities, local jails, other 
States' facilities, or Federal facilities. The 11 States not 
reporting con- tract housing costs for inmates in FY 2001 were 
Alabama, Iowa, Kansas, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, 
New Hampshire, North Carolina, Washington, and West Virginia. 

Contract housing averaged 6% of operating expenses, nationwide. 
However, seven States spent more than 3 times this proportion:

Montana spent $26.1 million, all of it to house inmates in 
private facilities.  Louisiana paid $171.1 million, 81% of 
it to house inmates in local jails; and Tennessee spent 
$150.7 million, about a third of it to hold inmates in 
private facilities and two-thirds in local jails.

Methodology

Following a procedure similar to that used to produce State 
Prison Expenditures, 1996, BJS asked government finance 
specialists at the U.S. Census Bureau to identify each
State's corrections function codes, as reported in the FY 
2001 Survey of Government Finances. Census staff entered this 
information into a data base, using a standardized format
provided by BJS.

--------------------------------------------
The data to produce the graph in the Highlights on page 1 are 
available with other tables of the report on the BJS
website <www.ojp.usdoj.gov/ bjs>. These data include inflation-
adjusted costs for total State corrections and prisons as well 
as costs per U.S.   Resident.
--------------------------------------------

This data extraction procedure included both inter- and
intragovernmental transfer payments, and clarified missing, 
repetitious, and out-of-range data items.  

Both department of corrections and State central office budget 
specialists were asked to review the originally submitted numbers. 
These officials worked with the Census Bureau to eliminate 
duplicate reports, interpret expenditure codes, and understand
organizational functions and accounting procedures. 

Budget officials sharpened the scope of the study by including 
expenditures for central office personnel who performed prison 
activities and deleting outlays that pertained to probation and
parole services, juvenile corrections, and nonresidential 
community corrections -- areas outside the prison function. 

Upon final approval by each State's designated financial 
reviewer, Census staff completed the data adjustment
phase of the project with a 100% response rate for total 
and operating expenditures. 

Underreporting

Correctional expenditures shown in the Highlights figure may be
underreported. As the result of discussions between State budget
officials and U.S. Census Bureau specialists in government 
finance who collected the  data for this report, the total cost 
to operate State prisons in FY 2001 was 1.1% higher than 
originally reported to the Census Bureau in the 2001 Survey of 
Government Finances.

Factors which contributed to the revised FY 2001 State prison 
spending figure included adjustments for central office staff 
assigned to prison, probation, parole, and juvenile activities; 
elimination of duplicate fund reporting; and access to final 
numbers following State submissions of preliminary numbers in 
the Survey of Government Finances.

Data limitations   

Expenditure data published in State Prison Expenditures, 2001 
and State Prison Expenditures, 1996 were reported by State 
budget officials, based on categories established by the 
Census Bureau's annual Survey of Government Finances. Previous 
State prison cost data published by BJS were reported by 
correctional facility operators.

Adjusting for inflation

State government expenditures for fiscal years 1996 and 2001 
were inflation-adjusted in 2001 constant dollars, as 
appropriate for State and local government spending. The
following annual chain-type price indexes for gross domestic 
product were employed as divisors and unadjusted
expenditures as dividends to produce inflation-adjusted 
expenditures in 2001 constant dollars:
