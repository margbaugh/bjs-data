Rape and Sexual Assault Victimization Among 
College-Age Females, 1995–2013

Sofi Sinozich, BJS Intern
Lynn Langton, Ph.D., BJS Statistician

For the period 1995–2013, females ages 18 to 24 had the
highest rate of rape and sexual assault victimizations
compared to females in all other age groups. Within
the 18 to 24 age group, victims could be identified as
students enrolled in a college, university, trade school or
vocational school or as nonstudents. Among student victims,
20% of rape and sexual assault victimizations were reported
to police, compared to 32% reported among nonstudent
victims ages 18 to 24 (figure 1).

This report describes and compares the characteristics
of student and nonstudent female victims of rape and
sexual assault, the attributes of the victimization, and
the characteristics of the offender. The findings are from
the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) National Crime
Victimization Survey (NCVS), which collects information on
nonfatal crimes reported and not reported to police against
persons age 12 or older. Rape and sexual assault are defined
by the NCVS to include completed and attempted rape,
completed and attempted sexual assault, and threats of rape or 
sexual assault (see Methodology). Unless otherwise noted,
this report presents aggregate estimates of rape and sexual
assault victimization for the period 1995 through 2013.
Aggregating data across the period increases the reliability
and precision of estimates and facilitates comparisons of
detailed victimization characteristics.

HIGHLIGHTS
*************

This report uses the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS) to compare the rape and sexual assault
victimization of female college students and nonstudents.
For the period 1995–2013--

* The rate of rape and sexual assault was 1.2 times higher
for nonstudents (7.6 per 1,000) than for students (6.1 per
1,000).

* For both college students and nonstudents, the offender
was known to the victim in about 80% of rape and sexual
assault victimizations.

* Most (51%) student rape and sexual assault victimizations
occurred while the victim was pursuing leisure activities
away from home, compared to nonstudents who were engaged in 
other activities at home (50%) when the victimization occurred.

* The offender had a weapon in about 1 in 10 rape and sexual 
assault victimizations against both students and nonstudents.

* Rape and sexual assault victimizations of students (80%)
were more likely than nonstudent victimizations (67%) to
go unreported to police.

* About a quarter of student (26%) and nonstudent (23%)
victims who did not report to police believed the incident
was a personal matter, and 1 in 5 (20% each) stated a fear
of reprisal.

* Student victims (12%) were more likely than nonstudent
victims (5%) to state that the incident was not important
enough to report.

* Fewer than 1 in 5 female student (16%) and nonstudent
(18%) victims of rape and sexual assault received assistance
from a victim services agency

Comparing the NCVS and other 
surveys that measure rape and 
sexual assault in a college-age 
population 
**********************************

The NCVS is one of several surveys used to study rape and
sexual assault in the general and college-age population.
In addition to the NCVS, the National Intimate Partner and
Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS) and the Campus Sexual Assault
Study (CSA) are two recent survey efforts used in research on
rape and sexual assault. The three surveys differ in important
ways in how rape and sexual assault questions are asked
and victimization is measured. Across the three surveys,
the measurement differences contribute, in part, to varying
estimates of the prevalence (the number of unique persons in
the population who experienced one or more victimizations
in a given period) and incidence (the number of victimizations
experienced by persons in the population during a given
period) of rape and sexual assault victimization.

Although conducted at different times, with different samples
and reference periods, both NISVS and CSA produced
prevalence rates that were substantially higher than the NCVS 
victimization and prevalence rates. Based on 2011 NISVS
data, 2% of all females experienced unwanted sexual contact
during the prior 12 months. ***Footnote 1 Breiding, M.J.,

of females ages 18 to 25 who were enrolled in two colleges and 
surveyed in the United States had experienced a completed 
sexual assault since entering college. ***Footnote 2 Krebs,

WG-BX-0010, document number 221153. Retrieved from 
https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf***. In 
comparison, in 2010 the NCVS showed that 1% of females age 12 
or older experienced one or more rape or sexual assaults in the 
prior year. ***Footnote 3 Measuring the Prevalence of Crime 
with the National Crime Victimization Survey, NCJ 241656, BJS 
web, September 2013***. For the period 2007–13, the NCVS 
victimization rate was 4.7 per 1,000 for females ages 18 to 24 
who were enrolled in post-secondary schools (not shown). 
Several of the key measurement differences that contribute to 
the different estimates include (see Appendix 1)--

* Survey context and scope. The NCVS is presented as a
survey about crime, while the NISVS and CSA are presented
as surveys about public health. The NISVS and CSA collect
data on incidents of unwanted sexual contact that may not
rise to a level of criminal behavior, and respondents may
not report incidents to the NCVS that they do not consider
to be criminal.

* Definitions of rape and sexual assault. The NCVS, NISVS, and 
CSA target different types of events. The NCVS definition is 
shaped from a criminal justice perspective and includes 
threatened, attempted, and completed rape and sexual assault 
against males and females (see Methodology). The NISVS uses a 
broader definition of sexual violence, which specifically 
mentions incidents in which the victim was unable to provide 
consent due to drug or alcohol use; forced to penetrate another
person; or coerced to engage in sexual contact (including
nonphysical pressure to engage in sex) unwanted sexual
contact (including forcible kissing, fondling, or grabbing);
and noncontact unwanted sexual experiences that do not
involve physical contact. ***Footnote 4 National Research 
Council. (2014). Estimating the incidence of rape and sexual 
assault. Panel on Measuring Rape and Sexual Assault in Bureau 
of Justice Statistics Household Surveys, C. Kruttschnitt, W.D.

Statistics, Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences and 
Education. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. 
Retrieved from 
http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=18605&page=R1, p. 
86***. The CSA definition of rape and sexual assault includes 
unwanted sexual contact due to force and due to incapacitation, 
but excludes unwanted sexual contact due to verbal or emotional 
coercion. ***Footnote 5 Krebs, C.P., Lindquist, C.H., Warner, 
T.D., Fisher, B.S., & Martin, S.L. (2007). The Campus Sexual 
Assault (CSA) study. Retrieved from 
https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf, p. 1–
3***.

* Question wording. The three surveys use different
approaches to asking about experiences with rape and
sexual assault. The NCVS uses a two-phased approach to
identifying incidents of rape and sexual assault. Initially,
a screener is administered, with cues designed to trigger
the respondent’s recollection of events and ascertain
whether the respondent experienced victimization during
the reference period. The screener questions are short
and worded specifically about experiences with rape and
sexual assault. For instance, “Incidents involving forced or
unwanted sexual acts are often difficult to talk about. Have
you been forced or coerced to engage in unwanted sexual
activity by (a) someone you didn’t know before, (b) a casual
acquaintance? OR (c) someone you know well?”

The screener is then followed by an incident form that
captures detailed information about the incident, including
the type of injury, presence of a weapon, offender
characteristics, and reporting to police.

Even if the respondent does not respond affirmatively
to the specific screeners on rape and unwanted sexual
contact, the respondent could still be classified as a rape or
sexual assault victim if a rape or unwanted sexual contact is
reported during the stage-two incident report.

Unlike the NCVS, which uses terms like rape and unwanted
sexual activity to identify victims of rape and sexual assault, 
the NISVS and CSA use behaviorally specific questions
to ascertain whether the respondent experienced rape
or sexual assault. These surveys ask about an exhaustive
list of explicit types of unwanted sexual contact a victim
may have experienced, such as being made to perform or
receive anal or oral sex.

* Mode and response rates. Collection mode and response
rates can impact data quality. The NCVS uses in-person
and telephone interviews to collect data and has an 88%
person and 74% overall response rate. The 2011 NISVS
uses random-digit dialing with a 33% response rate. The
2007 CSA is a self-administered survey with 33% to 43%
response rates.

Despite the differences that exist between the surveys,
a strength of the NCVS is its ability to be used to make
comparisons over time and between population subgroups.
The differences observed between students and nonstudents
are reliable to the extent that both groups responded
in a similar manner to the NCVS context and questions.
Methodological differences that lead to higher estimates of
rape and sexual assault in the NISVS and CSA should not affect
the NCVS comparisons between groups.

As a result, the differences in the NCVS between student and
nonstudent rates and variations in the characteristics of 
student and nonstudent victimizations should not be affected by 
the methodological differences impacting the overall level of 
rape and sexual assault victimization in the NCVS. Because the 
CSA only collects data from a student population, and student 
status cannot be identified in the NISVS, the magnitude of 
difference between these subgroups cannot be ascertained.
********************************************************

**********************************
Females ages 18 to 24 had higher 
rates of rape and sexual assault 
than females in other age groups
**********************************

From 1997 to 2013, females ages 18 to 24 consistently
experienced higher rates of rape and sexual assault than
females in other age brackets (figure 2). In 2013, collegeage
females had a similar rate of rape and sexual assault
regardless of enrollment status (about 4.3 victimizations per
1,000), while the victimization rate for not college-age (ages
12 to 17 and 25 or older) females was 1.4 victimizations per
1,000. For both students and nonstudents ages 18 to 24, the
2013 rates of rape and sexual assault were not significantly
different from their respective rates in 1997. During the
period, the rates for students did not differ significantly 
from one year to the next, though rates in the high years of 
2001 and 2002 were slightly higher than in the low year of 
2009. For nonstudents, there was more fluctuation. The rates 
ofrape and sexual assault victimization for nonstudents were
significantly higher for the period 1999–2001 than for the
periods 2005–07 and 2012–13.

**********************************
Rate of rape and sexual assault 
victimization was 1.2 times higher 
for nonstudents than students
**********************************

For the period 1995–2013, females ages 18 to 24 not enrolled
in a post-secondary school were 1.2 times more likely to
experience rape and sexual assault victimization (7.6 per
1,000), compared to students in the same age range (6.1 per
1,000) (table 1). Nonstudents (65,700) also accounted for
more than double the number of rape and sexual assault
victimizations as students (31,300).

The rate of completed rape for nonstudents (3.1 per 1,000)
was 1.5 times higher than for students (2.0 per 1,000).
However, there was no significant difference in the rates
of female students and nonstudents who experienced
attempted rape or other sexual assault. This suggests that
differences in the rates of completed rape largely accounted
for differences in the overall rates of rape and sexual assault 
between students and nonstudents.

Among female student victims ages 18 to 24, a third (33%)
of the rape and sexual assault victimizations involved
completed rape, while 2 in 5 nonstudent (40%) female
victims experienced completed rape (figure 3). The majority
of student (56%) and nonstudent (52%) victims experienced
attempted rape or other sexual assault.

**********************************
Rates of other violence
among college-age females
**********************************

Across all types of violent crime, female students had a lower 
victimization rate than nonstudents (table 2). For the
period 1995–2013, the rate of violent victimization was 1.6 
times higher for nonstudents (73.1 per 1,000) than students 
(46.3 per 1,000). For both students and nonstudents, the rate 
of rape and sexual assault was lower than the rate of  
aggravated and simple assault, but higher than the rate of 
robbery.
********************************************************

**********************************
Rape and sexual assault 
victimization among male students
**********************************

For the period 1995–2013, the rate of rape and sexual assault 
victimization was lower for males ages 18 to 24 than for 
females, regardless of enrollment status (table 3). College-age 
male victims accounted for 17% of rape and sexual assault 
victimizations against students and 4% against nonstudents. 
However, the rate of rape and sexual assault victimization for 
nonstudents(0.3 per 1,000) was a fifth of the rate for students 
(1.4 per 1,000). Due to the relatively small number of sample 
cases of male victims, this report focuses exclusively on 
females. Estimates of male rape and sexual assault 
victimization from the NCVS cannot be further disaggregated by 
victim and incident characteristics.

**********************************
Female students were more likely 
to experience rape or sexual 
assault victimization away from 
home, while nonstudents were more 
likely to be at home
**********************************

For both students and nonstudents, about 70% of rape and
sexual assault victimizations occurred either at the victim’s
home or the home of another known person (table 4). ***Footnote 
6 In the NCVS, the victim’s home is defined as the location of 
residence at the time of the interview***. A greater  
percentage of the victimizations against students
(29%) than nonstudents (17%) occurred at the home of a
known person, such as a friend, relative, or acquaintance.
In comparison, nonstudents (50%) experienced a greater
proportion of rape and sexual assaults at their homes
than students (38%). There were no significant differences
between the percentages of students and nonstudents
victimized in other places, including commercial areas, at
school, or on public transportation.

The majority (51%) of student rape and sexual assault
victimizations occurred while the victim was away from
home pursuing leisure activities or traveling from place to
place. Nonstudents (50%) were more likely than students
(31%) to be sleeping or pursuing other activities at home
when the victimization occurred. Nearly two-thirds of both
student (65%) and nonstudent (64%) victims experienced
the victimization at night (from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.).

**************************************
About 1 in 10 rape and sexual assault 
victimizations against college-age 
females involved a weapon
**************************************

For the period 1995–2013, the offender had a weapon in
about 1 in 10 rape and sexual assault victimizations against
female students (11%) and nonstudents (12%) (table 5).
There were no significant differences between students and
nonstudents in the percentage of rape and sexual assault
victimizations in which a weapon was present.

There was also no significant difference in the percentage of
student and nonstudent victims who sustained a physical
injury during the rape and sexual assault victimization. The
majority of student (57%) and nonstudent (63%) victims
suffered an injury (e.g, cuts, bruises, internal injuries, 
broken bones, gunshot wounds, or rape-related injuries) during 
the victimization. About 4 in 10 students (40%) and nonstudents
(37%) who were injured during the victimization received
medical treatment for their injuries.

**************************************
More than 3 in 4 student victims 
of rape and sexual assault knew 
the offender
**************************************

College-age female victims knew their offender in about
80% of rape and sexual assault victimizations, regardless
of their enrollment status (table 6). Nonstudents (34%)
were more likely than students (24%) to experience rape
or sexual assault committed by an intimate partner (i.e.,
a former or current spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend). For
student victims, offenders were more likely to be friends or
acquaintances (50%) than intimate partners (24%). Among
nonstudent victims, there was no significant difference in the
percentage of rape and sexual assault committed by friends
or acquaintances (37%) or intimates (34%). About 1 in 5
rape and sexual assault victimizations among students (22%)
and nonstudents (20%) were committed by a stranger.

**************************************
Similar percentages of student (47%) 
and nonstudent (40%) victims perceived 
that the offender was drinking or 
using drugs
**************************************

In the NCVS, victims of rape and sexual assault are asked to
provide information about the perceived characteristics of
their offenders. For the period 1995–2013, more than 90%
of rape and sexual victimizations of female students (95%)
and nonstudents (92%) were committed by a single offender,
rather than a group of offenders (table 7). Regardless of the
victim’s enrollment status, more than half of female victims
perceived that the offender was white. However, because
the NCVS did not collect information on the Hispanic
origin of the offender prior to 2012, Hispanic offenders
make up an unknown portion of the white, black, and
other race of offender categories. There were no significant
differences between students and nonstudents in the race of
the offender.

For both students and nonstudents, the vast majority of
offenders were male. However, a male was the offender in a
greater percentage of female student victimizations (97%)
than nonstudent victimizations (91%).

There was no difference in the distribution of offender age
among female student and nonstudent victims. More than
half of all offenders were perceived to be between the ages of
21 and 29 in victimizations involving both students (51%)
and nonstudents (53%). Student victims (25%) were less
likely than nonstudent victims (36%) to believe that the
offender was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol
at the time of the rape or sexual assault. However, about a
quarter of student (28%) and nonstudent (24%) victims did
not know whether the offender was using drugs or alcohol.

**************************************
A greater percentage of student (80%) 
Than nonstudent (67%) rape and sexual 
Assault victimizations were not 
reported to police
**************************************

For the period 1995–2013, rape and sexual assault
victimizations against female students (80%) were more
likely to go unreported to police, compared to victimizations
against nonstudents (67%) (table 8). Regardless of
enrollment status, rape and sexual assault victimizations
were more likely to go unreported than other types of
violent crime (not shown). The NCVS does not directly
collect information about whether victims reported to other
officials or administrators.

The reasons for not reporting a rape or sexual assault
victimization to police varied somewhat between students
and nonstudents. A greater percentage of nonstudent
(19%) than student (9%) victims stated that they did not
report to police because the police would not or could not
do anything to help. Nonstudent victims were also more
likely to state that they had reported to a different 
official.***Footnote 7 The NCVS does not ask victims for 
information about the types of other officials to which they 
may have reported***. Student victims (12%) were more likely 
to state that the victimization was not important enough to 
report, compared to nonstudent victims (5%). About a quarter 
of student (26%) and nonstudent (23%) victims who did not 
report to police believed the incident was a personal 
matter, and 1 in 5 (20% each) stated a fear of reprisal.
**************************************
No significant difference in the 
proportion of student and nonstudent 
victims who received assistance from
a victim service agency
**************************************

Fewer than 1 in 5 female student (16%) and nonstudent
(18%) victims of rape and sexual assault received assistance
from a victim services agency for the period 1995–2013
(table 9). Victim service agencies include public or privately
funded organizations that provide victims with support and
services to aid their recovery, offer protection, guide them
through the criminal justice system process, and assist with
obtaining restitution. There was no significant difference in
the proportion of victims who received assistance based on
enrollment status.

**************************************
Among females living in rural areas, 
the rate of rape and sexual assault 
victimization was almost 2 times higher 
for nonstudents (8.8 per 1,000) than 
students (4.6 per 1,000)
**************************************

For the period 1995–2013, there were no significant
differences in the student and nonstudent rates of rape
and sexual assault for black non-Hispanics, Hispanics, or
persons of other races (table 10). However, among white
non-Hispanic females, the rate of victimization was 1.4 times
higher for nonstudents (9.2 per 1,000) than for students
(6.7 per 1,000). Among female students, the rate of rape
and sexual assault was slightly higher for whites (6.7 per
1,000) than for Hispanics (4.5 per 1,000), but did not differ
significantly from the rate for blacks (6.4 per 1,000).

The rate of rape and sexual assault was 1.6 times higher
for females ages 18 to 19 not enrolled in college (10.4 per
1,000) than for female students in the same age group
(6.6 per 1,000). Among females ages 20 to 21, the rate of
victimization was 1.5 times higher for nonstudents (8.9 per
1,000) than students (5.8 per 1,000). There was no significant
difference in the rate of rape and sexual assault for students
and nonstudents ages 22 to 24.

Among female college students there were no significant
differences in the rate of victimization by age. However,
among nonstudents, the rate of victimization was lower for
females ages 22 to 24 (5.4 per 1,000) than for females ages 18
to 21.

Nonstudents in the South were slightly more likely (1.4
times) to experience rape and sexual assault, compared to
female students in the South. Across other regions of the
country, there were no significant differences in the student
and nonstudent victimization rates.

Female students in the Midwest (8.3 per 1,000) had a higher
rate of rape and sexual assault, compared to students in
the Northeast (5.2 per 1,000) and South (4.7 per 1,000).
Similarly, among nonstudents, females in the Midwest had
a higher rate of victimization than in any other region of
the country.

In rural areas, the rate of rape and sexual assault was
1.9 times higher for college-age nonstudents (8.8 per 1,000)
than students (4.6 per 1,000). Nonstudents in urban areas
(8.7 per 1,000) also had a slightly higher rate of 
victimization (1.3 times), compared to students in urban areas 
(6.6 per 1,000). In suburban areas, there was no significant 
difference in the rate of rape and sexual assault between 
femalestudents (6.0 per 1,000) and nonstudents (6.3 per 1,000).
Among female students, there was no significant variation
in rape and sexual assault rates across urban, suburban, and
rural areas. Among nonstudents, females living in suburban
areas had the lowest victimization rates.

Methodology
***************

Survey coverage
****************

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an
annual data collection conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau
for the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The NCVS is a
self-report survey in which interviewed persons are asked
about the number and characteristics of victimizations
experienced during the prior 6 months. The NCVS collects
information on nonfatal personal crimes (rape or sexual
assault, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and personal
larceny) and household property crimes (burglary, motor
vehicle theft, and other theft) both reported and not
reported to police. In addition to providing annual level and
change estimates on criminal victimization, the NCVS is
the primary source of information on the nature of criminal
victimization incidents.

Survey respondents provide information about themselves
(e.g., age, sex, race and Hispanic origin, marital status,
education level, and income) and whether they experienced
a victimization. The NCVS collects information for each
victimization incident about the offender (e.g., age, sex, race
and Hispanic origin, and victim–offender relationship),
characteristics of the crime (including time and place of
occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic
consequences), whether the crime was reported to police,
reasons the crime was or was not reported, and victim
experiences with the criminal justice system.

The NCVS is administered to persons age 12 or older from a
nationally representative sample of households in the United
States. The NCVS defines a household as a group of persons
who all reside at a sampled address. Persons are considered
household members when the sampled address is their usual place 
of residence at the time of the interview and when they have no 
usual place of residence elsewhere. Once selected, households 
remain in the sample for 3 years, and eligible persons in these 
households are interviewed every 6 months either in person or 
over the phone for a total of seven interviews.

All first interviews are conducted in person with subsequent
interviews conducted either in person or by phone. New
households rotate into the sample on an ongoing basis to
replace outgoing households that have been in the sample
for the 3-year period. The sample includes persons living
in group quarters, such as dormitories, rooming houses,
and religious group dwellings, and excludes persons
living in military barracks and institutional settings such
as correctional or hospital facilities, and persons who
are homeless.

NCVS measurement of rape 
and sexual assault
*************************

This report focuses on rape and sexual assault victimizations,
including completed, attempted, and threatened rape or sexual 
assault. Because of the sensitive nature of the topic,  
measuring the extent of these victimizations is often 
difficult, and best practices are still being determined. For
the NCVS, survey respondents are asked to respond to a
series of questions about the nature and characteristics of
their victimization. The NCVS classifies victimizations as
rape or sexual assault, even if other crimes, such as robbery
or assault, occur at the same time. The NCVS then uses the
following rape and sexual assault definitions:

* Rape is the unlawful penetration of a person against the
will of the victim, with use or threatened use of force,
or attempting such an act. Rape includes psychological
coercion and physical force, and forced sexual intercourse
means vaginal, anal, or oral penetration by the offender.
Rape also includes incidents where penetration is from a
foreign object (e.g., a bottle), victimizations against males
and females, and both heterosexual and homosexual rape.
Attempted rape includes verbal threats of rape.

* Sexual assault is defined across a wide range of
victimizations separate from rape or attempted rape.
These crimes include attacks or attempted attacks usually
involving unwanted sexual contact between a victim and
offender. Sexual assault may or may not involve force and
includes grabbing or fondling.

The measurement of rape and sexual assault presents many
challenges. Victims may not be willing to reveal or share
their experiences with an interviewer. The level and type of
sexual violence reported by victims is sensitive to how items
are worded, which definitions are used, the data collection
mode, and a variety of other factors related to the interview
process. In addition, the legal definitions of rape and sexual
assault vary across jurisdictions. The NCVS presents one
approach to measuring and enumerating these incidents as
well as other forms of violence and property crime.

Comparison of NCVS and National 
Center for Education Statistics 
student population statistics
********************************

This report focused on females ages 18 to 24, which
account for about 32% of the total population enrolled in
post-secondary institutions. Footnote 8 National Center for 
Education Statistics***. To assess whether the NCVS
estimates of the college student population accurately reflect
the actual population of students, NCVS weighted counts of
enrolled students were compared to data collected through
the National Center for Education Statistics’ (NCES)
Integrated Post-Secondary Education Data System (IPEDS).

From 1997 to 2011, the years of available NCES data, the
NCVS estimates of the female population of college students
were significantly lower than the NCES estimates in 9 of the
15 years (table 11). In the years in which the NCVS estimate
differed from the IPEDS population count, the NCVS female
student population was about 10% lower.

Nonresponse and weighting adjustments
**************************************

In 2013, 90,630 households and 160,040 persons age 12
or older were interviewed for the NCVS. Each household
was interviewed twice during the year. The response rate
was 84% for households and 88% for eligible persons.
Victimizations that occurred outside of the United States
were excluded from this report. In 2013, less than 1% of the
unweighted victimizations occurred outside of the United
States and were excluded from the analyses.

Estimates in this report use data from the 1995 to 2013
NCVS data files, weighted to produce annual estimates
of victimization for persons age 12 or older living in U.S.
households. Because the NCVS relies on a sample rather
than a census of the entire U.S. population, weights are
designed to inflate sample point estimates to known
population totals and to compensate for survey nonresponse
and other aspects of the sample design.

The NCVS data files include both person and household
weights. Person weights provide an estimate of the
population represented by each person in the sample.
Household weights provide an estimate of the U.S.
household population represented by each household in the
sample. After proper adjustment, both household and person
weights are also typically used to form the denominator in
calculations of crime rates.

Victimization weights used in this analysis account for the
number of persons present during an incident and for 
highfrequency repeat victimizations (i.e., series 
victimizations). Series victimizations are similar in type but 
occur with such frequency that a victim is unable to recall 
each individual event or describe each event in detail. Survey 
procedures allow NCVS interviewers to identify and classify 
these similar victimizations as series victimizations and to 
collect detailed information on only the most recent incident 
in the series.

The weight counts series incidents as the actual number of
incidents reported by the victim, up to a maximum of
10 incidents. Including series victimizations in national rates
results in large increases in the level of violent 
victimization; however, trends in violence are generally 
similar, regardless of whether series victimizations are 
included. In 2013, series incidents accounted for about 1% of 
all victimizations and 4% of all violent victimizations. 
Weighting series incidents as the number of incidents up to a 
maximum of 10 incidents produces more reliable estimates of 
crime levels, while the cap at 10 minimizes the effect of 
extreme outliers on rates. Additional information on the series 
enumeration is detailed in the report Methods for Counting 
High-Frequency Repeat Victimizations in the National Crime 
Victimization Survey (NCJ 237308, BJS web, April 2012).

Standard error computations
***************************

When national estimates are derived from a sample, as with
the NCVS, it is important to use caution when comparing
one estimate to another estimate or when comparing
estimates over time. Although one estimate may be larger
than another, estimates based on a sample have some degree
of sampling error. The sampling error of an estimate depends
on several factors, including the amount of variation in the
responses and the size of the sample. When the sampling
error around an estimate is taken into account, the estimates
that appear different may not be statistically different.

One measure of the sampling error associated with an estimate 
is the standard error. The standard error can vary from one 
estimate to the next. Generally, an estimate with a small 
standard error provides a more reliable approximation of the 
true value than an estimate with a large standard error. 
Estimates with relatively large standard errors are associated
with less precision and reliability and should be interpreted
with caution.

To generate standard errors around numbers and estimates
from the NCVS, the Census Bureau produced generalized
variance function (GVF) parameters for BJS. The GVFs
take into account aspects of the NCVS complex sample
design and represent the curve fitted to a selection of
individual standard errors based on the Jackknife Repeated
Replication technique. The GVF parameters were used to
generate standard errors for each point estimate (e.g., counts,
percentages, and rates) in this report.

BJS conducted tests to determine whether differences in
estimated numbers, percentages, and rates in this report
were statistically significant once the sampling error was
taken into account. Using statistical programs developed
specifically for the NCVS, all comparisons in the text were
tested for significance. The primary test procedure was
the Student’s t-statistic, which tests the difference between
two sample estimates. Differences described as higher,
lower, or different passed a test at the 0.05 level of 
statistical significance (95% confidence level). Differences 
described as somewhat, slightly, or marginally different, or 
with some indication of difference, passed a test at the 0.10 
level of statistical significance (90% confidence level). 
Caution must be taken when comparing estimates not explicitly 
discussed in this report.

Data users can use the estimates and the standard errors of
the estimates provided in this report to generate a confidence
interval around the estimate as a measure of the margin of
error. The following example illustrates how standard errors
can be used to generate confidence intervals:

* According to the NCVS, for the period 1995–2013,
the rate of rape and sexual assault for female students
ages 18 to 24 was 6.1 per 1,000 persons (see table 1).
Using the GVFs, it was determined that the estimated
victimization rate has a standard error of 0.56 (see
appendix table 2). A confidence interval around the
estimate was generated by multiplying the standard
errors by ±1.96 (the t-score of a normal, two-tailed
distribution that excludes 2.5% at either end of the
distribution). Therefore, the 95% confidence interval
around the 6.1 estimate is 6.1 ± (0.56 X 1.96) or (5.0 to
7.2). In others words, if different samples using the same
procedures were taken from the U.S. female student
population, 95% of the time the rape and sexual assault
rate would fall between 5.0 and 7.2 per 1,000 persons.

In this report, BJS also calculated a coefficient of variation
(CV) for all estimates, representing the ratio of the standard
error to the estimate. CVs provide a measure of reliability
and a means to compare the precision of estimates across
measures with differing levels or metrics. In cases in which
the CV was greater than 50%, or the unweighted sample had
10 or fewer cases, the estimate was noted with a “!” symbol.
(Interpret data with caution. Estimate based on 10 or
fewer sample cases, or the coefficient of variation is greater
than 50%.)

Methodological changes to the NCVS in 2006
*******************************************

Methodological changes implemented in 2006 may have
affected the crime estimates for that year to such an extent
that they are not comparable to estimates from other
years. Evaluation of 2007 and later data from the NCVS
conducted by BJS and the Census Bureau found a high
degree of confidence that estimates for 2007 through 2013
are consistent with and comparable to estimates for 2005 and
previous years. The reports, Criminal Victimization, 2006,

Differences between the NCVS and other 
Surveys measuring rape and sexual 
assault in a college-age population
**************************************

The NCVS is one of several surveys used to study rape and
sexual assault in the college-age population. In addition to
the NCVS, two recent survey efforts used in research on
rape and sexual assault of college students are the National
Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS)
and the Campus Sexual Assault Study (CSA). Each of
these surveys has a different purpose and methodological
approach than the NCVS. Depending on which of the three
data sources are used, researchers will generate different
estimates of the prevalence and frequency of rape and sexual
assault victimization. Some of these differences include—

* Survey context and scope. In a 2014 report on the
measurement of rape and sexual assault in the NCVS
and other federal surveys, the National Research Council
(NRC) of the National Academies of Sciences described
survey context as “a major contributor of differences in
the estimates of rape and sexual assault” across different
data collections. ***Footnote 9 National Research Council. 
(2014). Estimating the incidence of rape and sexual assault, p. 
96***.  Survey context refers to how the survey is described to 
respondents through notification letters, survey questions, or 
the interviewer. The NCVS is an omnibus survey designed to 
collect information on experiences with a broad range of 
crimes. It is likewise presented to respondents as a survey 
about criminal victimization. Because victims of rape or sexual 
assault may not consider their victimization a crime, this 
context could discourage or suppress recall and reporting of 
those incidents. ***Footnote 10 Krebs, C.P., Lindquist, C.H., 
Warner, T.D., Fisher, B.S., & Martin, S.L. (2007). The Campus 
Sexual Assault (CSA) study. Retrieved from 
https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf, p. 
15***.  Additionally, because the NCVS covers a wide range of 
criminal victimization, the number of screening questions 
related to rape and sexual assault are limited. In comparison, 
the NISVS focused on sexual violence, stalking, and intimate 
partner violence and was presented as a survey collecting data 
on a range of behaviors that impact public health. This public 
health perspective may encourage respondents to recall and 
report on experiences that they may not typically think of as 
criminal victimization. It also may result in the collection of 
incidents that may not be considered criminal behavior. 
Similarly, the CSA study focused specifically on rape and 
sexual assault, also from a public health and safety  
perspective.

* Definitions of rape and sexual assault. The NCVS,
NISVS, and CSA define rape and sexual assault slightly
differently. The NCVS definition is shaped from a criminal
justice perspective and includes threatened, attempted, and
completed rape and sexual assault against males and females
(see Methodology). Penetration due to coercion is included
in the definition of rape, but the survey does not specifically
ask about incidents in which the victim was unable to
provide consent because of drug or alcohol consumption.
Because the NISVS is focused on rape and sexual assault
from a public health perspective, the scope of sexual violence
included in NISVS is broader than the definitions used in
the NCVS. In NISVS, sexual violence includes threatened,
attempted, or completed rape, including incidents in which
the victim was unable to provide consent due to drug or
alcohol use; forced penetration of another person; sexual
coercion, which includes nonphysical pressure to engage
in sex; unwanted sexual contact, including forcible kissing,
fondling, or grabbing; and noncontact unwanted sexual
experiences, which do not involve physical contact. ***Footnote 
11 National Research Council. (2014). Estimating the incidence 
of rape and sexual assault, p. 86***. The CSA definition of 
rape and sexual assault included unwanted sexual contact due to 
force and due to incapacitation, but excluded unwanted sexual 
contact due to verbal or emotional coercion.***Footnote 12 
Krebs, C.P., Lindquist, C.H., Warner, T.D., Fisher, B.S., & 
Martin, S.L. (2007). The Campus Sexual Assault (CSA) study. 
Retrieved from
https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf, p. 1–
3***.

* Longitudinal versus cross-sectional design. Both the
CSA and NISVS were cross-section data collections
administered to the sample a single point in time that
asked about events that occurred during a specified
reference period. The NCVS is a longitudinal survey
administered seven times to the same sampled household,
with questions asked about events occurring since the last
interview. Longitudinal surveys like the NCVS have the
advantage of bounding the reference period and ensuring
that events occurring outside of that reference period are
not included in estimates. Since research has suggested
that traumatic events, such as rape and sexual assault, may
be particularly prone to telescoping (i.e., the reporting of
events occurring outside of a reference period as though
they occurred within the specified period), unbounded
surveys may have artificially high incident rates due to
events occurring outside of the reference period being
telescoped in.

* Question wording. The language and ordering of
questions in a survey may affect whether a respondent
indicated that an incident occurred. The three surveys
used different approaches to asking about experiences
with rape and sexual assault. The NCVS used a twophased
approach to identifying incidents of rape and
sexual assault. Initially, a screener was administered, with
cues designed to trigger the respondent’s recollection of
event and ascertain whether the respondent experienced
victimization during the reference period. The
screener questions directly focused on rape and sexual
assault were—

* (Other than any incidents already mentioned), has
anyone attacked or threatened you in any of these
ways:… (e) any rape, attempted rape, or other type of
sexual attack;

* Incidents involving forced or unwanted sexual acts are
often difficult to talk about. (Other than any incidents
already mentioned), have you been forced or coerced
to engage in unwanted sexual activity by (a) someone
you didn’t know before, (b) a casual acquaintance? OR
(c) someone you know well?

Even if the respondent did not respond affirmatively to these
specific screeners on rape and unwanted sexual contact, the
respondent could still be classified as a rape or sexual 
assault victim if a rape or unwanted sexual contact was 
reported during the stage-two incident report.

Unlike the NCVS which used terms like rape and unwanted
sexual activity to identify victims of rape and sexual assault,
the NISVS and CSA used behaviorally specific questions to
ascertain whether the respondent experienced rape or sexual
assault. For example, one question on the NISVS survey read:

* When you were drunk, high, drugged, or passed out
and unable to consent, how many people ever…

–– had vaginal sex with you? By vaginal sex, we mean
that {if female: a man or boy put his penis in your
vagina} {if male: a women or girl made you put your
penis in her vagina}.

–– {if male} made you perform anal sex, meaning that
they made you put your penis into their anus? made
you receive anal sex, meaning they put their penis
into your anus?

–– made you perform oral sex, meaning that they put
their penis in your mouth or made you penetrate
their vagina or anus with your mouth?

–– made you receive oral sex, meaning that they put
their mouth on your {if male: penis} {if female:
vagina} or anus? ***Footnote 13 National Research Council. 
(2014). Estimating the incidence of rape and sexual assault, p. 
89***.

Questions on the CSA used similar behaviorally specific cues
to identify victims of rape and sexual assault.

*  Survey mode. The NCVS, NISVS, and CSA used different
modes of administration. The CSA study was a self administered
web survey sent via email to students at the participating 
colleges. Self-administered surveys are not subject to 
interviewer effects, but may result in lower response rates or 
confusion over question wording that could otherwise be 
clarified by an interviewer. The NISVS was a random digit 
dialing telephone survey. Telephone surveys exclude respondents 
without a phone, may be subject to sampling bias because of 
multiple phones associated with particular households or 
individuals, and may be subject to nonresponse bias due to low 
response rates. ***Footnote 14 National Research Council. 
(2014). Estimating the incidence of rape and sexual assault, p. 
102***.  The NCVS used a multimode design that begins
with an initial in-person interview, followed by telephone
follow-ups every 6 months for the 3.5 years the household
is in the sample. While respondents can develop rapport
with the interviewer and familiarity with the survey
questions, the NCVS may be more subject to interviewer
effects than the CSA or NISVS.

* Population surveyed. The NCVS and NISVS were administered to 
a national sample of noninstitutionalized persons, meaning that 
findings are generalizable to the noninstitutionalized U.S. 
population of persons ages 18 to 24 with some exceptions. The 
NCVS uses a household based sample, so persons who are homeless 
are excluded from the scope. The NISVS was administered using 
random digit dialing, which excludes persons without a 
telephone. In comparison, the CSA was administered to a 
stratified random sample of students at two large public 
universities. ***Footnote 15 Krebs, C.P., Lindquist, C.H., 
Warner, T.D., Fisher, B.S., & Martin, S.L. (2007). The Campus 
Sexual Assault (CSA) study. Retrieved from https://
www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf, p. 3–11***.
Because of the limited population included in the CSA, it 
should not be assumed that findings from the survey are 
representative of the population of persons ages 18 to 24 or 
even to college students specifically.

* Survey response rates and bias. Surveys with low response 
rates have an increased potential for nonresponse bias compared 
to surveys with higher response rates. ***Footnote 16 National 
Research Council. (2014). Estimating the incidence of rape and 
sexual assault, p. 127***.  Nonresponse bias means that those 
who participated in the survey may differ in important ways 
from those who did not participate, which could in turn impact 
the survey findings. In 2013, the NCVS had an 88% response rate 
for eligible persons and a combined persons and household 
response rate of 74%, while the 2011 NISVS had an overall 
response rate of 33.1%, and the CSA response rate was between 
33% and 43% for males and females at the two  schools.

Measuring rape and sexual assault victimization is an evolving 
field. BJS is currently engaged in a variety of
projects exploring ways to improve the measurement of rape
and sexual assault through the NCVS and related surveys.
