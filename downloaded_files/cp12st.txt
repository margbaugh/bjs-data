Capital Punishment, 2012 – Statistical Tables

Tracy L. Snell, BJS Statistician

At yearend 2012, 35 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons held 3,033 
inmates under sentence of death, which was 32 fewer than at yearend 2011 
(figure 1). This represents the twelfth consecutive year in which the number 
of inmates under sentence of death decreased.

Four states (California, Florida, Texas, and Pennsylvania) held more than 
half of all inmates on death row on December 31, 2012. The Federal Bureau of 
Prisons held 56 inmates under sentence of death at yearend 2012.

Of prisoners under sentence of death at yearend 2012, 56% were white and 42% 
were black. The 384 Hispanic inmates under sentence of death accounted for 
14% of inmates with a known ethnicity. Ninety-eight percent of inmates under 
sentence of death were male, and 2% were female. The race and sex of inmates 
under sentence of death has remained relatively unchanged since 2000.

Among inmates for whom legal status at the time of the capital offense was 
available, 40% had an active criminal justice status. About 4 in 10 of these 
inmates were on parole, and nearly 3 in 10 were on probation. The remaining 
inmates had charges pending, were incarcerated, had escaped from 
incarceration, or had some other criminal justice status.

Criminal history patterns of death row inmates differed by race and Hispanic 
origin. More black inmates had a prior felony conviction (73%), compared to 
Hispanic (64%) or white (63%) inmates. Similar percentages of white (9%), 
black (9%), and Hispanic (6%) inmates had a prior homicide conviction. A 
slightly higher percentage of Hispanic (32%) and black (30%) inmates were on 
probation or parole at the time of their capital offense, compared to 24% of 
white inmates.

In 2012, 19 states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported that 79 inmates 
were received under sentence of death. Admissions in Florida (20), California 
(13), Texas (9), and Pennsylvania (6) accounted for 61% of those sentenced to 
death in 2012.

Twenty states and the Federal Bureau of Prisons removed 111 inmates from 
under sentence of death: 43 were executed, 17 died by means other than 
execution, and 51 were removed as a result of commutations or courts 
overturning sentences or convictions. Removals in Texas (17) and Florida (10) 
accounted for a quarter of all inmates removed from under sentence of death 
in 2012.

Nine states executed 43 inmates in 2012. The inmates executed in 2012 had 
been under sentence of death an average of 15 years and 10 months, which was 
8 months less than those executed in 2011.

Among the 36 jurisdictions with prisoners under sentence of death at yearend 
2012, 5 jurisdictions had more inmates than at yearend 2011, 13 had fewer 
inmates, and 18 had the same number. Florida showed the largest increase (up 
10 inmates). Oklahoma and Texas (down 8 each), followed by Mississippi (down 
7), North Carolina (down 6), and Arizona (down 5) had the largest decreases.

The U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976 (see Gregg v. 
Georgia, 427 U.S. 153 (1976) and its companion cases). From 1976 to 2000, the 
number of inmates under sentence of death in the U.S. steadily increased 
until it peaked at 3,601 inmates on December 31, 2000 (figure 2). In 2001, 
the number of inmates removed from under sentence of death was higher than 
the number admitted for the first time since 1976 (figure 3). The number of 
annual removals of those under sentence of death exceeded the number of 
admissions every year since 2001. The 79 inmates received under sentence of 
death in 2012 represent a 5% decrease from the 83 inmates received in 2011. 
The number of inmates received in 2012 was the smallest number of admissions 
to death row since 1973 when 44 persons were admitted.

Of the 8,032 people under sentence of death between 1977 and 2012, 16% had 
been executed, 6% died by causes other than execution, and 40% received other 
dispositions.*** Footnote 1Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s 1976 approval 
of revised statutes in some states (Gregg v. Georgia), executions of inmates 
resumed in 1977.***The federal government began collecting annual execution 
statistics in 1930. Between 1930 and 2012, a total of 5,179 inmates were 
executed under civil authority (figure 4).***Footnote 2 Military authorities 
carried out an additional 160 executions between 1930 and 1961, which are not 
included in this report.*** After the Supreme Court reinstated death penalty 
statutes in 1976, 35 states and the federal government executed 1,320 
inmates.

*********************************************
One state repealed its death penalty statute 
in 2012, one state had a portion of its statute 
declared unconstitutional, and one state 
revised its capital statute
*********************************************

As of December 31, 2012, 36 states and the federal government authorized the 
death penalty (table 1). Although New Mexico repealed the death penalty in 
2009 (Laws 2009, ch. 11 § 5), the repeal was not retroactive, and offenders 
charged with a capital offense committed prior to the repeal may be eligible 
for a death sentence. As of December 31, 2012, New Mexico held two men under 
previously imposed death sentences, and one person was awaiting sentencing 
with the state seeking the death penalty.

In 2012, the Connecticut legislature repealed the death penalty (Public Act 
No. 12-5), effective for only those capital offenses committed on or after 
April 25, 2012. Since the repeal was prospective, 10 men remained under 
sentence of death as of December 31, 2012.

The Arkansas Supreme Court overturned a portion of the state’s capital 
criminal procedure on June 22, 2012. The decision in Hobbs v. Jones (2012 
Ark. 293) found that the Method of Execution Act of 2009 (Ark. Code Ann. § 5-
4-617 (Supp. 2011)) violated the separation of powers doctrine in Article 4 
of the Arkansas Constitution because the legislature granted the executive 
branch sole discretion in selecting the method of administering the drugs for 
lethal injections.

During 2012, Delaware revised its statutory provisions relating to the death 
penalty. The legislature added home invasion as a class B felony offense to 
the statute (11 Del. Code Ann. 11 Del. Code Ann. § 826A) and amended the 
aggravating factors for which a death penalty may be imposed to include 
murder committed in the course of a home invasion (11 Del. Code Ann. § 
4209(e)(1)j), effective June 1, 2012.

*********************************************
Lethal injection was authorized by all 
states with capital statutes
*********************************************

As of December 31, 2012, all 36 states with death penalty statutes authorized 
lethal injection as a method of execution (table 2).
In addition to lethal injection, 15 states authorized an alternative method 
of execution; 8 states authorized electrocution; 3 states, lethal gas; 3 
states, hanging; and 2 states, firing squad.

In states that authorized multiple methods of execution, the condemned 
prisoner generally selects the method. Five of the 15 states (Arizona, 
Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Utah) stipulated which method must be used 
depending on either the date of the offense or sentencing. One state (New 
Hampshire) authorized hanging only if lethal injection could not be given. 
Four states authorized alternative methods if lethal injection is ruled to be 
unconstitutional: Delaware authorized hanging, Oklahoma authorized 
electrocution or firing squad, Utah authorized firing squad, and Wyoming 
authorized lethal gas.

The method of execution of federal prisoners is lethal injection, pursuant to 
28 CFR, Part 26. For offenses prosecuted under the federal Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the method used is that of the state 
in which the conviction took place (18 U.S.C. 3596.

************************************************************

*******************
Executions in 2013
*******************

In 2013, 9 states executed 39 inmates, which was four fewer than the number 
executed in 2012. 

Three states accounted for nearly three-quarters of the executions carried 
out during this period: Texas executed 16 inmates, Florida executed 7 
inmates, and Oklahoma executed 6 inmates. 

Of the 39 executions carried out in 2013, 38 were by lethal injection. One 
inmate in Virginia was executed by electrocution.
A woman was executed in 2013 in Texas.

Methodology
**************

Capital punishment information is collected annually as part of the National 
Prisoner Statistics program (NPS-8). This data series is collected in two 
parts: data on persons under sentence of death are obtained from the 
department of corrections in each jurisdiction currently authorizing capital 
punishment, and the status of death penalty statutes is obtained from the 
Office of the Attorney General in each of the 50 states, the District of 
Columbia, and the federal government. Data collection forms are available on 
the BJS website at www.bjs.gov.

NPS-8 covers all persons under sentence of death at any time during the year 
who were held in a state or federal nonmilitary correctional facility. This 
includes capital offenders transferred from prison to mental hospitals and 
those who may have escaped from custody. It excludes persons whose death 
sentences have been overturned by the court, regardless of their current 
incarceration status.

The statistics included in this report may differ from data collected by 
other organizations for various reasons: (1) NPS-8 adds inmates to the 
population under sentence of death not at sentencing, but at the time they 
are admitted to a state or federal correctional facility; (2) if inmates 
entered prison under a death sentence or were reported as being relieved of a 
death sentence in one year but the court had acted in the previous year, the 
counts are adjusted to reflect the dates of court decisions (see note on 
table 4 for the affected jurisdictions); and (3) NPS counts are always for 
the last day of the calendar year and will differ from counts for more recent 
periods.

All data in this report have been reviewed for accuracy by the data providers 
in each jurisdiction prior to publication.
