During 2004 the total Federal, State, and local 
adult correctional population -- incarcerated or 
in the community -- grew by 59,900 to reach nearly 
7 million. The growth of 0.9% during the year was 
a third of the average annual increase of 2.7% 
since 1995. About 3.2% of the U.S. adult population, 
or 1 in every 31 adults, were incarcerated or on 
probation or parole at yearend 2004.

The probation population reached 4,151,125 on
December 31, 2004.  This represented an increase of
0.2% for the year, less than a tenth of the average
annual increase of 2.8% since 1995. During 2004 the
adult parole population grew 2.7%, more than double
the average annual increase of 1.3% since 1995, to
a total of 765,355.  

Nearly 5 million persons on 
probation or parole

The number of adult men and women in the United
States who were being supervised on probation or
parole at the end of 2004 reached a new high of
4,916,480, up from 3,757,282 on December 31, 1995. 
These data were collected in the 2004 Annual
Probation Survey and the 2004 Annual Parole Survey
conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS).

Probationers are criminal offenders who have been
sentenced to a period of correctional supervision 
in the community in lieu of incarceration. Parole 
is a period of conditional supervised release 
following a prison term. Prisoners may be released 
to parole either by a parole board decision or by 
mandatory conditional release.

In 2004 the growth in the community supervision
population was 0.5%, or 26,573 additional persons
added during the year. The increase was less than 
a fifth of the average annual increase of 3.0% 
since 1995. 

Probationers accounted for half the growth in the
correctional population since 1990

Probationers accounted for half the total growth 
in the correctional population since 1990. Overall, 
the correctional population increased by nearly 2.5
million, or 57%, from 1990 to 2004. Probationers
accounted for 51% of the growth (or 1,262,000),
followed by prisoners (27% or 679,000), jail 
inmates (12% or 309,000), and parolees (9% or 
234,000).  

Community supervision declined as a 
percentage of the correctional 
population

Between 1990 and 2004 the prison population was
the fastest growing correctional population, with 
an average annual increase of 4.7%, followed by 
jails (4.1%), probation (2.8%), and parole(2.6%).

As a percentage of the correctional population,
offenders under community supervision accounted
for 70% in 2004 (down from nearly 74% in 1990), 
while those incarcerated accounted for 30%(up 
from 26% in 1990). 

Probationers continued to account for the majority 
of all persons under correctional supervision in 
2004 (59%, compared to 61% in 1990). Parolees were
11% of the total population in 2004 (down from 12%
in 1990). In contrast, prisoners increased to 20% 
of the total correctional population in 2004 (up 
from 17% in 1990), and jail inmates increased to 
10% (up from 9% in 1990). 

Correctional supervision rate rose 
sharply from 1980 to 2004

The rate of U.S. adult residents under correctional
supervision nearly tripled between 1980 (1,132 per
100,000) and 2004 (3,175 per 100,000). During 2004
the U.S. resident population increased at a higher
rate (1.2%) than the population under correctional
supervision (0.9%). Despite growth in the total
correctional population from 6,936,600 in 2003 to
6,996,500 in 2004, the rate of U.S. men and women
under correctional supervision fell from 3,186 per
100,000 adult residents to 3,175 in 2004.
 
6 of the 10 States with largest 
probation populations also had 
large parole populations 

Texas, California, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, 
and Illinois had 6 of the 10 largest probation 
populations in the Nation at yearend 2004. These 
six States accounted for more than a third of all 
probationers (37%). The same six States were among 
the 10 States with the largest parole populations 
in the Nation. Almost half of all parolees were 
supervised within these six States (48%).

Texas and California alone accounted for more than
1 million adults supervised in the community, or 
about 1 in 5 probationers and parolees. Texas led 
the Nation with 530,845 persons on probation or 
parole, followed by California with 495,113. 

Among the States, Massachusetts had the largest
percentage of its adult population under community
supervision (3.4% at yearend 2004), followed by
Texas (3.3%) and Rhode Island (3.2%). 

Despite having the largest parole population and 
the second largest probation population in the 
Nation, the percentage of California's adult 
population under community supervision was 1.9%, 
or slightly below the Nation's percentage of 2.2%.

Eight States reported that less than 1,000 per
100,000 adult residents were under community
supervision. New Hampshire had the lowest rate 
of supervision in the community (553 offenders 
per 100,000 adults).

4 States reported an increase 
of 10% or more in their probation 
population 

In 2004 Kentucky reported the largest increase 
(15%) in the number of adults on probation, 
followed by Mississippi (12%), New Mexico (11%), 
and New Jersey (10%). A total of twenty-seven 
States reported an increase in their adult 
probation population during 2004.

Twenty-one States had fewer adults on probation 
at the end of 2004 than at the beginning of the 
year, led by Washington State, down 27%, the 
only double-digit decrease during 2004.

6,343 probationers added in 2004

During 2004 the probation population grew by 
6,343. The growth in the number of probationers 
(0.2%) was less than a tenth of the average 
annual increase since 1995(2.8%).  

At yearend 2004 the probation supervision rate
totaled 1,884 probationers per 100,000 adult 
U.S. residents -- the equivalent of almost 1 
in every 53 adults. Two States, Massachusetts 
(3,301 per 100,000) and Rhode Island (3,117 
per 100,000), had more than 3% of their adult 
resident population under probation supervision.

A total of 11 States had less than 1% of their 
adult resident population under probation 
supervision. Two States had a rate below 500 
probationers per 100,000 adult residents: New 
Hampshire (431 per 100,000) and West Virginia
(488 per 100,000).

Probation population grew less 
in 2004 than in any of the previous 
25 years

During 2004 the probation population increased
0.2%, the smallest increase in the population 
since the survey was introduced in 1979. The 
number of entries (2,217,900) exceeded the 
number of exits (2,210,400) during 2004. 
Compared to 2003 the number of entries to 
probation (2,217,900) declined (from 
2,229,700 in 2003), and the number of exits 
(2,210,400) increased (from 2,179,800). 

Since 2000 entries to probation have increased 
at a slower rate annually (0.7%) than exits 
(1.3% annually).

Growth in probation since 1990 
linked to entries

Since 1990 the probation population has steadily
increased from 2,649,300 to 4,151,100 in 2004.
Although the number of entries decreased from 
1990 (1,637,600) to 1994 (1,397,500), entries 
exceeded exits during that period, resulting in 
an average annual increase of 3.0% in the 
probation population. The number entering 
probation has increased each year since 1994, 
except for a 2.0% decrease in 2001 and a 0.5% 
decrease in 2004. 

Between 1995 and 1999 the probation population
increased an average of about 100,000 each year.
Beginning in 2001 the annual increase in the 
number of probationers declined from 105,500, 
to 92,300 in 2002, to 49,900 in 2003. In 2004 
the annual increase reached its lowest since 
data collection began in 1979 -- an additional 
6,300 probationers.
 
5 States accounted for nearly a third 
of the growth in probation from 1995 
to 2004

In absolute numbers the probation population
increased 854,100 between 1995 and 2004.
California experienced the largest growth 
(104,300), followed by Pennsylvania (60,400), 
Michigan (34,700), Illinois (34,400), and 
Minnesota (30,400). These five States accounted 
for 31% of the growth in probation since 1995.

In 2004 three States, the Federal system, and 
the District of Columbia had at least 2,000 
fewer adult men and women on probation at 
yearend compared to yearend 1995. New York 
had the largest decrease in the number of 
probationers (46,000). 

-----------------------------------------------
At yearend 2004 almost 1 in 4 probationers were
female; more than 1 in 2 were white

Nationwide women represented a slightly larger
percentage of the probation population in 
2004 than in 1995. Women were 23% of 
adults on probation in 2004 (957,600), up 
from 21% in 1995.

At yearend 2004 more than half of all 
probationers were white (2,325,300); almost 
a third were black (1,235,100); and an eighth 
were Hispanic (518,100). Persons of other 
races comprised about 2% of probationers 
(72,700).

Direct sentences to probation 
more common in 2004 than 1995

A larger percentage of probationers in 2004 had
received a direct sentence to probation (56%) 
than in 1995 (48%). A smaller percentage had a 
probation sentence combined with incarceration 
(8%, compared to 15% in 1995). The percentage 
of probationers that received a sentence to
incarceration which was suspended has slowly
declined (26% in 1995, to 25% in 2000, to 24% 
in 2004).

Half of all probationers convicted of a
misdemeanor; success rates have remained
stable since 1995

For the first time since data collection 
began in 1979, probationers convicted of 
a  misdemeanor (50%) accounted for a 
larger percentage of the population than 
probationers convicted of a felony (49%).  

The largest percentage of the probation 
population was convicted of a drug law 
violation (26%), followed by a DWI (15%) 
and larceny/theft (12%).

Almost 3 in 4 probationers were under active
supervision at yearend. Probationers under 
active supervision are required to regularly 
report to a probation authority in person, 
by mail, or by telephone. The percentage of 
probationers required to report regularly 
declined steadily, from 79% in 1995 to 76% 
in 2000 and to 74% in 2004.

About 1 in 11 probationers had absconded at 
yearend 2004. Though still on probation, 
absconders had failed to report and could 
not be located. Absconders remained stable 
at 9% of all persons on probation between 
1995 and 2004.

Sixty percent of the more than 2.2 million 
adults discharged from probation in 2004 had 
successfully met the conditions of their 
supervision. The percentage of probationers 
discharged successfully remained stable, from 
62% in 1995 to 60% in 2000 and 2004. 
Probationers discharged from supervision
because of incarceration due to a rule 
violation or new offense decreased from 21% 
in 1995 to 15% in 2000 and 2004. Another 4% 
of those discharged from probation had 
absconded, and 10% had their probation 
revoked without incarceration.
----------------------------------------------

Growth in parole twice the average 
annual increase since 1995

At the end of 2004 a total of 765,355 adult men 
and women were on parole. The population grew 
20,230 during the year, or 2.7%, more than 
double the average annual increase of 1.3% since 
1995. The growth in the parole population during 
2004 was the second largest increase since 1995
(3.1% in 2003). 

At yearend 2004, 347 persons were under parole
supervision per 100,000 adult residents, or 1 
out of every 288 adults in the United States. 
Pennsylvania (806 per 100,000) was the State 
with the highest rate of parole supervision, 
while Washington and Maine had the lowest rates 
of supervision (3 per 100,000). Both the latter 
States abolished discretionary parole, in 1984 
and 1975, respectively.

Parole population increased 
in 39 States  

A total of 39 States had more adults on parole 
at the end of 2004 than at the beginning of the 
year. Double-digit increases were reported in 
10 States. Nebraska (24%) was the only State 
to report an increase of over 20%. 

A total of nine States reported a decrease in 
their parole population during 2004, with 
Nevada (13%)having the only double-digit 
decrease. One State, Maine, reported no change 
in the parole population during the year.
 
State parole population increasing 
after stability during the 1990's

From 1980 to 1992 the State parole population
increased from 196,800 to 618,700, or an 
average of 10% annually. During the period from 
1992 to 1998, the growth in the population 
slowed, increasing a total of 10,500, the 
equivalent of an average annual increase of 
nearly 0.3%. In the following period, 1998
to 2004, the State parole population added 
46,300 additional parolees, the equivalent of 
a 1% increase annually.

Growth in State parole linked to entries

From 1980 to 1990 the number of entries to 
State parole supervision more than tripled 
from 113,400 to 349,000. State parole 
entries continued to rise during the 1990's 
(up an average of 2.4% annually), but were 
offset by an increase in parole discharges 
(up an average of 4.6% annually).

From 2000 to 2004 the number of State parole
entries continued to exceed the number of 
exits, but both grew at a slower pace; 
entries grew 1.3% annually while exits grew 
1.0%.

Since 1980 discretionary releases to parole
supervision have steadily declined

As a percentage of all releases from State prison,
discretionary releases by a parole board steadily
declined from 55% in 1980 to 22% in 2003. From
1980 to 1995 mandatory parole releases increased
(from 19% to 39%). These trends were consistent
with the change in release policy occurring within
many States after 1980, resulting in a shift away 
from discretionary releases in favor of determinate
sentences and mandatory supervised release. (See
Trends in State Parole, 1990-2000, October 2001,
NCJ 184735.)

Compared to the increase during the 15-year 
period from 1980 to 1995, mandatory parole 
releases remained relatively stable from 1995 
(39%) to 2003 (36%).

Releases from State prison due to expiration of
sentence increased from 13% of all releases in 
1990 to 21% in 2001. That type of release 
declined to 19% in 2003. 

From 1995 to 2002 other conditional releases 
from State prison rose slightly (from 10% in 
1995 to 12% in 2000). These releases include 
unspecified releases and releases to probation. 
In 2003 other conditional releases comprised 
nearly 15% of all releases from State prison.  

1 in 8 parolees were female 

At yearend 2004 women made up about 1 out of
every 8 adults on parole (94,400). Women (12%)
represented a growing percentage of the parole
population since 1995 (10%).

From 1995 to 2004 black parolees decreased as a
percentage of all parolees (45% down to 41%).
During this same period, the percentage of
parolees who were white steadily increased (34% 
in 1995, 38% in 2000, and 40% in 2004). Almost 
1 in 5 parolees were Hispanic (136,500). About 
2% of parolees were of other races (11,700).

More than 8 in 10 parolees were 
under active supervision 

Active supervision requires parolees to regularly
report to a parole authority in person, by mail, 
or by telephone. This type of supervision steadily 
increased as a percentage of all parolees from 78% 
in 1995, to 83% in 2000, to 85% in 2004. Parolees 
on inactive status, excluded from regular 
reporting but still on parole, decreased as a 
percentage of all parolees, from 11% in 1995 to 
3% in 2004. Another 7% of all parolees in 2004 
had absconded, 4% were supervised out of State, 
and 1% were supervised through some other type of 
status.

About 4 in 10 parolees served a 
sentence for a drug offense

About 95% of all parolees had been sentenced 
to 1 year or more in State or Federal prison 
at yearend 2004. The largest percentage of 
parolees had been convicted of a drug offense 
(38%), followed by a property offense (26%) 
and a violent offense (24%). Another 12% of 
parolees had been convicted of other 
offenses, such as public order violations.

Rates of success for parolees have 
remained stable since 1995

As a percentage of all discharges, parolees 
who successfully met the conditions of their 
supervision have remained nearly stable between 
1995 (45%)and 2004 (46%). During this period 
the success rates for parolees were consistently 
lower than the success rates for probationers 
(62% in 1995 and 60% in 2004).

Since 1995 the total estimated number of 
parolees discharged from supervision increased 
from 391,300 to 483,000 in 2004. During this 
time, the number of successful exits increased 
from 176,300 in 1995 to 223,400 in 2004.

In 2004, 187,000 parolees were discharged from
supervision and returned to incarceration 
because of a rule violation or new offense, up 
from 160,000 in 1995. Despite the increase in 
the number of parolees returned to incarceration, 
the percentage of all exits resulting from re-
incarceration have remained nearly stable
between 1995 and 2004 (41% and 39%, 
respectively).

Methodology

The Annual Probation Survey and Annual Parole 
Survey provide a count of the total number of 
persons supervised in the community on January 
1 and December 31, 2004, and a count of the 
number entering and leaving supervision during 
the year. These surveys cover all 50 States, 
the District of Columbia, and the Federal 
system. The first annual report on probation 
and parole appeared in 1979.

Data for the Federal system are from the
Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts 
as provided to the BJS Federal Justice 
Statistics Program.

Because many States update their population 
counts, the January 1, 2004, numbers may 
differ from those previously published for 
December 31, 2003.

Probation  

The 2004 Annual Probation Survey was sent to 
468 respondents -- 34 central State reporters, 
the District of Columbia, the Federal system, 
and 432 separate State, county, or court 
agencies. States with multiple reporters were 
Alabama (3), Arizona (2), Colorado (8), Florida 
(43), Georgia (5), Idaho (2), Kentucky (3),
Michigan (128), Missouri (2), Montana (4), New
Mexico (2), Ohio (187), Oklahoma (3), Tennessee
(3), Washington (35), and West Virginia (2). A 
locality in Ohio did not provide data. For this 
agency, the 12/31/03 population count was used 
as the 1/1/04 and 12/31/04 counts. 

Since 1995 the survey coverage has been expanded
to include 179 additional agencies. At yearend 
2004, 219,195 probationers were under the 
supervision of these agencies. For year-to-year 
comparisons, use total counts based on the same 
reporting agencies --3,266,837 in 1997 to compare 
with the final 1996 counts; 3,417,613 in 1998 to 
compare with final 1997; and 3,772,773 in 1999 
to compare with final 1998. 

Parole  

The 2004 Annual Parole Survey was sent to 54
respondents, including 52 central reporters, 
the California Youth Authority, and 1 municipal 
agency. States with multiple reporters were 
Alabama (2) and California (2). 

Federal parole as defined here includes supervised
release, parole, military parole, special parole,
and mandatory release.
