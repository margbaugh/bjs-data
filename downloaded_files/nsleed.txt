report are those of the Bureau of Justice Statistics and not of 
the United States Sentencing Commission***.

The United States has three national data resources that
collect law enforcement employment statistics along with other 
information unique to each collection. The FBI, U.S. Census 
Bureau, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) data 
collections programs have different purposes, data definitions, 
respondent universes, and data collection procedures. This 
report details the similarities and differences among these 
three collections and discusses when the use of one may be 
preferred over the others.

Law enforcement in the United States is made up of about
18,000 federal, state, county, and local agencies. Each agency
has varying legal and geographic jurisdictions, ranging from
single-officer police departments to those with more than
30,000 officers. The most common type of agency is the small
town police department that employs 10 or fewer officers. The
decentralized, fragmented, and local nature of law enforcement
in the United States makes it challenging to accurately count 
the number of agencies and officers.

The three primary data sources provide comprehensive
information about the nature and scope of law enforcement
employment in the United States:

* The FBI collects data on the number and type of law
enforcement employees as part of its Uniform Crime
Reporting (UCR) Program.

* The Census Bureau collects data on all government agency
employees, including police agencies, as part of its Annual
Survey of Public Employment and Payroll (ASPEP).

* BJS collects law enforcement employment data through its 
periodic Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies 
(CSLLEA).

These three sources provide information about the number of
sworn and nonsworn officers at the state and national levels.
The sources vary in the type of information they provide about
law enforcement employees and in the number and size of law
enforcement agencies that report the information. This report
describes and compares the three data sources, including the
information collected and how different agencies and personnel
are defined and enumerated.

Uniform Crime Reporting Program, Police Employee Data
*******************************************************

Federal Bureau of Investigation
**********************************

The FBI has administered the UCR Program since 1930.
State and local law enforcement agencies voluntarily report
to the UCR Program crimes known to law enforcement,
arrest information, and law enforcement employee data. The
UCR Program provides information on the level of crime in
the United States, including the number and type of crimes
reported to state and local law enforcement agencies, and
arrests made by these agencies. More detailed incident-based
information for selected crimes and jurisdictions is provided
through the Supplementary Homicide Reports and the National
Incident-Based Reporting System. ***Footnote 2 Supplementary 
Homicide Reports provide more detailed information on the 
circumstances surrounding homicides and the characteristics of 
victims and offenders. See The Nation’s Two Measures of 
Homicide (NCJ 122705, BJS web, May 2003***. ***Footnote 3 The 
National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) provides more 
details about crime incidents in selected states and 
jurisdictions that report to NIBRS. See 
http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/nibrs and http://www***.

The UCR Program also collects data on law enforcement
employees from reporting agencies, including the number,
type, and characteristics of these employees. In addition, the
FBI collects information about the number of law enforcement
officers killed and assaulted, including demographics, patrol
assignments, and other characteristics of these officers. FBI
police employee data are reported in the Crime in the United
States series, available at https://www.fbi.gov/about-
us/cjis/ucr/ucr-publications.

Each year, state and local law enforcement agencies across
the United States voluntarily report to the UCR Program the
total number of sworn law enforcement officers and civilians
employed by their agencies as of October 31. Law enforcement
employees include sworn law enforcement officers and
nonsworn (or civilian) personnel. Sworn employees carry
a firearm and a badge, have full arrest powers, and are paid
from government funds set aside specifically for sworn law
enforcement staff. Full-time nonsworn staff include clerks,
radio dispatchers, meter attendants, stenographers, jailers,
correctional officers, and mechanics. Employees who do not
perform primary law enforcement functions or officers who
are not paid out of police funds are excluded, as are employees
who primarily serve the civil justice system, provide courtroom
security, or provide staffing at jail facilities. Law 
enforcement employees of federal agencies are also excluded.

UCR law enforcement employee data include information
on the number and characteristics of employees responsible
for performing primary law enforcement functions. Data
are also available for nonsworn employees. The data provide
information on the size of the population uniquely served by
the reporting agency, the rate of officers per 1,000 population
(calculated by the FBI), and the sex of employees. ***Footnote 
4 The UCR allocates population served to the agency that has 
primary law enforcement responsibility for that population. In 
most instances, it is a municipal police department or a county 
sheriff. There are occasional exceptions depending on the 
state. Some agencies serve populations that are primarily 
served by other agencies (e.g., a transit police department). 
In such cases, the agency is classified as a “zero population 
agency.” However, a zero population is never assigned to an 
agency in the UCR because of missing information***. An 
analysis of the UCR law enforcement employee data archived at 
the University of Michigan’s Inter-university Consortium for 
Political and Social Research (ICPSR) indicates that there were 
750,340 sworn law enforcement officers employed by the state 
and local agencies that reported law enforcement employee data 
to the UCR in 2012. The annual national estimate of sworn 
officers per 1,000 U.S. residents ranged from 2.23 in 1992 to 
2.51 in 2008 (table 1). ***Footnote 5 Counts provided from the 
UCR police employee data are based on a convenience sample of 
agencies that voluntarily reported to the FBI and do not 
represent a national sample. Agencies that reported no 
employees to the UCR were eliminated from the sample so their 
populations would not affect population-based officer rates***. 

The FBI estimates that the approximately 18,000 agencies that
report annually to the UCR cover 98% of the U.S. population. 
***Footnote 6 FBI. (2014). Summary of the Uniform Crime 
Reporting (UCR) Program. Crime in the United States, 2013.

the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/about-ucr/aboutucrmain_final.
pdf***. In 2012, a total of 17,379 agencies, or 95% of the 
agencies that participated in the UCR Program that year 
(N = 18,290), reported at least one law enforcement employee. 
***Footnote 7 FBI. (2013). FBI Releases 2012 Crime Statistics. 
Available at: http://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/
fbi-releases-2012-crime-statistics***. In each year from 1992 
through 2012, more than two-thirds of the agencies that reported 
employment data served jurisdictions with a population of less 
than 10,000 (table 2).

The UCR Program does not impute missing law enforcement
employee data. It eliminates duplicate entries and conducts
data quality checks. Data are published on an annual basis
approximately 1 year after the reference year through the
Crime in the United States report. Public use data files are
available within 18 months after the reference year. Files from
1998 are archived and available for download at the ICPSR.
Data from all years are available upon request from the FBI’s
Criminal Justice Information Services Division, Crime 
Statistics Management Unit.

************************************************
Annual Survey of Public Employment and Payroll
************************************************

U.S. Census Bureau, Governments Division
*******************************************

Since 1957, the Census Bureau’s Governments Division has
conducted the ASPEP to measure the number of federal,
state, and local civilian government employees and their gross
monthly payroll for March of the survey year. The ASPEP
collects employment information for the federal government
and for state and local governments.

The ASPEP tracks 28 defined government functions. ***Footnote 8 
overnment functions include elementary and secondary education, 
higher education, police protection, fire protection, financial 
administration, central staff services, judicial and legal 
services, highways, public welfare, solid waste management, 
sewerage, parks and recreation, health, hospitals, water 
supply, electric power, gas supply, transit, natural resources, 
correction, libraries, air transportation, water transport and 
terminals, other education, state liquor stores, social 
insurance administration, and housing and community 
development. Three functions apply only to the federal 
government and have no counterpart at the state and local government 
levels: national defense and international relations, postal service, 
and space research and technology***. Of these functions, 
police protection provides the most complete information on law 
enforcement employees. Employees classified as police 
protection by the ASPEP conduct all activities concerned with 
the enforcement of law and order, including local police 
departments, sheriffs’ offices, state police, coroners’ 
offices, police training academies, investigation bureaus, and 
temporary holding or lockup facilities. ***Footnote 9 Temporary 
holding or lockup facilities typically detain individuals for 
no more than 72 hours and are not part of a larger correction 
facility that holds inmates for longer periods of time***.

Information on employees who provide police protection is 
collected from payroll records for agencies that include 
general police, sheriff, state police, and other government 
departments that preserve law and order; protect persons and 
property from illegal acts; and work to prevent, control, 
investigate, and reduce crime.

Police protection employee statistics do not provide
information on special jurisdiction agencies such as park
rangers or fish and game wardens, federal postal inspectors,
campus police, and transit police; law enforcement employees
of legal offices; traffic control and engineering performed
by nonpolice agencies; police jails that hold people beyond
arraignment; and civil or bailiff activities of sheriffs’ 
offices.

The ASPEP provides information on all employees, full-time
employees, full-time-equivalent employees, and total March
payroll by government function. ***Footnote 10 Prior to 1996, 
the reference month was October***. Information about police
protection employees is provided separately for police officers
(i.e., employees who have the power of arrest) and other (i.e.,
nonsworn) employees. In 2012, the ASPEP reported a total of
687,657 sworn and 891,289 total police protection employees
in the United States at a rate of 2.19 sworn officers per 1,000
U.S. residents. The number of sworn police protection
employees ranged from a low of 516,418 in 1992 to 695,981
in 2009 (table 3).

The ASPEP is completed annually by government agencies
that handle payroll at the federal, state, and local levels. 
***Footnote 11 The ASPEP was not conducted with state and local 
agencies in 1996, when the reference month for payroll was 
changed from October to March***. The survey collects 
information about employees in all federal and state 
jurisdictions in each survey year, and about employees in all 
local jurisdictions in years ending in 2 or 7. The ASPEP is 
distributed to a sample of local government jurisdictions in 
all other years. ***Footnote 12 Local government jurisdictional 
boundaries do not always coincide with the geography served by 
the law enforcement agencies. As a result, it is difficult to 
compare local ASPEP data to those collected by the CSLLEA or 
UCR law enforcement employee program data***. Data are 
collected on all civilian employees of all federal government 
agencies (except the Central Intelligence Agency, the National 
Security Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency), all 
agencies of the 50 state governments, and more than 90,000 
local governments (including the District of Columbia), 
representing counties, municipalities, townships, special 
districts, and school districts. ***Footnote 13 Prior to 2005, 
the District of Columbia was included with state governments. 
Since 2005, the District of Columbia has been categorized as a 
local government***. In 2012, the federal government and all 50 
states had ASPEP unit response rates of 100%, and the local 
government response rate was 81% (2012 was a census year for 
local governments).

The Census Bureau imputes missing ASPEP data due to 
nonresponse. The imputation procedure relies on historical data 
from the same reporting agency or, if the agency’s data are not 
available, it uses data from a similar agency. Historical data 
are adjusted by current growth trends in government employment 
numbers and payroll to impute the missing information.

The Census Bureau releases data from the ASPEP about 2 years
after the reference year. A summary report, summary tables,
online analysis, and downloadable data from 1992 (excluding
1996) are available for each level of government at http://www.
census.gov/govs/apes/. Data prior to 1992 can be obtained
by contacting the Census Bureau Outreach and Education
Branch directly.

Census of State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies
****************************************************

Bureau of Justice Statistics
******************************

In 1983, BJS awarded a grant to the University of Maryland to
review existing law enforcement data collections, focusing on
both the quality and the utility of the data. To assess the 
utility of the data, two user surveys were conducted: (1) a 
survey of 152 large police departments (i.e., those serving 
100,000 persons or more) and (2) telephone interviews of 
police, researchers, and policymakers. The police department 
survey produced information about the availability and 
desirability of various data items, while the interviews 
revealed differences in the perceived utility of data items 
for the police as compared to researchers and policymakers. 
The final report recommended that BJS continue to develop a 
national-level data collection, and outlined eight steps 
toward this goal. ***Footnote 14 Uchida, C. D., Bridgeforth, 
C., & Wellford, C. F. (1984). Law Enforcement Statistics--
The State of the Art. College Park, MD: University of Maryland, 
Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology. An initial sample 
survey, conducted in 1987, used the Directory Survey of 
Law Enforcement Agencies as a sampling frame and was identified 
as the first Law Enforcement Management and Administrative 
Statistics Survey conducted by BJS. ***Footnote 15 Profile of 
State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies, 1987 (NCJ 113949, 
BJS web, March 1989). See also Police Departments in Large Cities, 
1987 (NCJ 119220, BJS web, August 1989)***. The basic structure of
recurring BJS law enforcement data collections includes two
parts. The CSLLEA is conducted about every 4 years and collects 
a limited and essential core set of measures regarding police 
agencies and provides an accurate sampling frame for the second 
part of the collection. A more detailed Sample Survey of Law 
Enforcement Agencies is conducted in years between the census 
years. ***Footnote 16 The sample survey is now part of BJS’s 
Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics 
series***.

BJS has conducted the CSLLEA since 1992. CSLLEA surveys were 
administered in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, and 2008. ***Footnote 
17 The 2014 Census of Federal, State, and Local Law Enforcement 
Agencies was in the field at the time of this report***. Data 
are used to measure the number and type of state and local law 
enforcement and special jurisdiction agencies in the United 
States, along with some characteristics of those agencies, 
including the number of sworn and nonsworn employees in each 
agency. CSLLEA agency employee data can be disaggregated by 
full-time or part-time status, sex, race or Hispanic origin, 
population served, and patrol assignments.

The CSLLEA universe is made up of all state and local law
enforcement agencies in the United States, including primary
state police, sheriffs’ offices, local police departments, 
tribal police, special jurisdiction agencies, and other agencies. 
Federal agencies were excluded from the CSLLEA. In 2008, there 
were an estimated 461,063 sworn officers in local agencies, 
182,979 in sheriffs’ offices, and 60,772 in state police 
agencies. Across all agency types, the CSLLEA reported 2.52 
sworn officers per 1,000 U.S. residents in 2008 (table 4).

BJS develops a roster of all state and local law enforcement
agencies in the United States for each survey administration.
The roster is developed from the previous survey administration 
list along with a thorough review of FBI lists, consultation 
with various police membership organizations, and lists 
provided by State Peace Officer Standards and Training offices 
and other state agencies. BJS realizes that this list may not 
be  comprehensive because it is difficult to identify all
small agencies.

Surveys are then mailed or distributed electronically to all
agencies on the roster (about 20,000 in 2008), with extensive
nonresponse follow-up. Responding agencies are screened for 
eligibility to be included in the final CSLLEA database. 
Agencies are determined to be ineligible if they (1) employ 
only part-time officers and the total combined hours of those 
officers average less than 35 hours a week, (2) contract or 
outsource to another agency for the performance of all 
services, (3) are private i.e., they do not operate with funds 
from a state, local, or special district, or a tribal government), 
(4) have officers that are unpaid volunteers only, or (5) were not 
fully operational at the time of the survey administration. Some 
agencies in the CSLLEA universe are not included in the UCR law 
enforcement employee data. Since the CSLLEA was first administered 
in 1992, about 18,000 responding agencies met these inclusion 
criteria, ranging from 17,358 agencies in 1992 to 18,769 agencies 
in 1996 (table 5).

CSLLEA data are reported voluntarily, and unit response rates 
have historically been close to 100% due to a number of  
nonresponse follow-up efforts. Data quality checks are 
performed by survey staff, and item nonresponses for critical 
measures are replaced with agency data from the previous survey 
administration and flagged as such.

BJS releases information from the CSLLEA through several agency 
publications and downloadable datasets. BJS bulletins present 
summary findings from each CSLLEA administration, and periodic 
special reports based on CSLLEA data provide information on 
topics such as tribal law enforcement. Data are available at 
the agency level and can be aggregated to the city, county, 
state, and national levels. Data are available from ICPSR and 
are released about 2 to 3 years after the reference year.

******************************
Comparing the three sources
******************************

The three national sources of law enforcement employment
data have a number of similarities, but also differ in 
coverage, timing, and level of detail (figure 1). For example, 
the CSLLEA is generally conducted every 4 years, while the 
ASPEP and UCR data are available annually. The ASPEP is the 
only source for comparing the number of employees and payroll 
of those serving in police protection functions to other 
government employee functions. These and other differences may 
indicate that one source has more advantages than others for 
certain research or policy purposes.

Each source relies on voluntary reporting from government
agencies. The FBI follows up with the largest nonresponding
agencies to encourage them to provide complete data. In 2012, 
95% of the state and local law enforcement agencies that
participated in the UCR reported at least one law enforcement
employee. Although the FBI conducts data quality checks and
follow-up, it does not adjust for missing data. The CSLLEA has
a high local agency response rate (100% in 2008), likely due to
the extensive nonresponse follow-up procedures. The ASPEP has a 
100% response rate at the state and federal levels, and about 
an 80% response rate for local jurisdictions. The ASPEP imputes 
data missing due to agency nonresponse, while the CSLLEA 
imputes missing information due to unit nonresponse and item 
nonresponse for critical categories.

All UCR and CSLLEA program data are reported voluntarily;
therefore, coverage may vary from year to year, although
the extent to which the programs cover all law enforcement
agencies in the United States is unknown. An estimate of the
extent to which the law enforcement employment data from the 
UCR and CSLLEA include information from all eligible law
enforcement agencies in the United States is needed; however,
a comprehensive and current roster of all law enforcement
agencies in the United States is currently unavailable.

Each source provides information on sworn officers or those
with general arrest powers who carry a firearm, although the
sources differ in how they categorize sworn employees. Unlike
the UCR and CSLLEA, the ASPEP excludes sworn officers who are 
employed by transit police or school police agencies and 
instead categorizes these employees with arrest powers under 
other government functions. UCR data are limited to employees 
of agencies that primarily have law enforcement functions. UCR 
data exclude officers employed by agencies that serve court- 
and jail-related functions, while these officers are included 
in CSLLEA data.

There are also differences in how each source defines nonsworn
or civilian law enforcement employees. The ASPEP definition of
police protection employees other than police (sworn) officers
includes employees working for agencies that may not employ
any sworn officers, such as coroners’ offices. The UCR and
CSLLEA define nonsworn employees as those who work for agencies 
that primarily conduct law enforcement functions.

The ASPEP provides a national source of information on
federal law enforcement employees, while the CSLLEA and
UCR include state and local law enforcement agencies only.
BJS conducted a separate collection, the Census of Federal
Law Enforcement Officers, every 2 years between 1996 and
2008, and it was discontinued after the 2008 administration.
Measures of federal law enforcement employees are now included 
in the 2014 CSLLEA, which was in the field at the time of this 
report. These data are similar to the ASPEP coverage of federal 
law enforcement in that they include supervisory and  
nonsupervisory personnel with federal arrest authority who were 
also authorized to carry firearms while on duty. Both the ASPEP 
and BJS definitions of federal law enforcement employees 
exclude U.S. Armed Forces agencies and the Central Intelligence 
Agency.

Agency-level data are only available from the UCR and
CSLLEA. Although the ASPEP data are collected at the local
level, information on police protection employees is not
available for individual law enforcement agencies that serve
local jurisdictions. The ASPEP provides information about
the number of police protection employees in a specific local
jurisdiction but does not allocate those employees to the
multiple law enforcement agencies that may have jurisdiction in
that locality.

The CSLLEA provides additional information on agency
functions and other agency characteristics, including
employee functions and assignment types. It provides detailed
information on patrol assignments, with measures related to
patrol capacity (e.g., uniformed officers with regularly 
assigned duties that include responding to citizen calls for 
services, community policing officers, or school resource 
officers) and patrol operational area (e.g., law enforcement 
duties only, jail-related duties only, court-related duties 
only, other single operational area, or multiple operational 
areas that include or exclude law enforcement duties).

Compared to the UCR and ASPEP data collections, the
CSLLEA may provide a more complete frame for enumerating
all agencies with sworn law enforcement officers because it
relies on multiple sources, including the UCR, to compile a 
list of agencies to survey in each CSLLEA administration. 
Specific data elements collected during the survey 
administration are analyzed to determine if those agencies meet 
the CSLLEA definition of a law enforcement agency. The CSLLEA 
may also offer more complete agency-level data for small 
agencies. It includes more agencies that report at least one 
full-time sworn employee compared to the UCR, although the gap 
decreased from 3,474 agencies in 1996 to 917 agencies in 2008. 
The number of agencies is different because the CSLLEA captures
more agencies with one employee (table 6 and table 7).

Differences in how the three sources defined sworn law
enforcement employees and in the number and type of agencies
reporting to each source likely drove differences in the number
and rate of sworn law enforcement officers that each reported.
The CSLLEA and UCR consistently reported more full-time sworn 
officers than the ASPEP; however, all three sources followed 
similar trends over the time period studied. The rate of 
officers per 1,000 U.S. residents increased in the early 1990s, 
but has remained relatively consistent since 2000 at about 2.5 
officers per 1,000 U.S. residents according to the UCR and 
CSLLEA data, and at 2.25 per 1,000 according to the ASPEP. The 
2012 ASPEP and UCR data show a decrease in the number of sworn 
officers per 1,000 U.S. residents, compared to 2011 (table 8, 
figure 2).

Differences across sources are also evident at the state level.
In 2008, estimates derived from the convenience sample
of agencies that reported police employee data to the UCR 
indicated that most states (26) reported fewer than 2.25 sworn 
officers per 1,000 U.S. residents (figures 3, 4, and 5). 
***Footnote 18 State rates were calculated by dividing the 
total number of sworn officers reported to each data source by 
the total state population for a given year, multiplied by 
1,000. State population estimates were retrieved from the 
Census Bureau’s State Intercensal Estimates for 1992 to 2012 
(July 1 estimates), available 
at http://www.census.gov/popest/data/intercensal/. Because 
reporting to the UCR is voluntary and information on the number 
of sworn officers is based on a convenience sample of the 
agencies that reported, the number and rate of sworn officers 
presented here are likely to be lower than the true number and
rate of officers nationally***. According to all three sources, 
the District of Columbia, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, and 
New York each reported more than 2.75 sworn officers per 1,000 
U.S. residents in 2008. In addition, 10 states have a rate of 
2.0 officers or fewer per 1,000 U.S. residents: Alaska, Iowa, 
Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, Washington, 
and West Virginia.

Nationally, the rate of officers per 1,000 U.S. residents was
similar according to the CSLLEA and UCR, and slightly lower
according to the ASPEP. However, in 2008 the ASPEP sworn
officer rates for Arizona (2.5) and Massachusetts (3.3) were
higher than the state rates reported by the CSLLEA (2.3 in
Arizona and 2.8 in Massachusetts) and the UCR (2.1 in Arizona
and 2.7 in Massachusetts). Differences across the three sources
were most pronounced in Delaware (from 2.0 in the ASPEP
to 3.3 in the UCR), the District of Columbia (from 5.3 in the
ASPEP to 8.7 in the UCR), and Georgia (from 2.2 in the ASPEP
to 4.0 in the UCR).

**************
Conclusion
**************

The CSLLEA likely captures more comprehensive information
on the number of law enforcement officers employed by small
agencies and appears to have the most complete coverage of
agencies and the most complete data, with a typical 100%
response rate. It is also likely to provide the most complete
information on agencies serving specialized functions or
jurisdictions because these agencies are excluded from the
ASPEP police protection function and may be less likely to
participate in the UCR.

UCR data may be best suited to compare the number of law
enforcement officers to reported crime rates because this is
the only source that collects both types of information 
directly from participating agencies. However, UCR coverage may 
be limited because about 1,000 fewer agencies participated in 
the UCR than the CSLLEA in 2008.

A comparison of CSLLEA and ASPEP data for local agencies only 
(excluding employees of state and special district agencies) 
shows that the CSLLEA captures a greater number of nonsworn 
officers employed by local law enforcement agencies (table 9). 
This difference is likely due to variations in scope between 
the two collections. The CSLLEA includes employees of all 
agencies with at least one full-time-equivalent sworn law 
enforcement officer, while the ASPEP police protection category 
excludes a number of agencies that would fall into the CSLLEA 
scope (e.g., special forces of nonpolice agencies such as park 
rangers, fish and game wardens, campus police, and transit 
police). Therefore, the CSLLEA may be better suited to examine 
the purpose and functions of nonsworn officers in law 
enforcement agencies.

The percentages of total local employees who were sworn 
officers reported to the CSLLEA and ASPEP were similar
in most states, with the ASPEP sworn percentage within 10
percentage points of the CSLLEA’s sworn percentage in 40
states and the District of Columbia. In the remaining 10 
states, the ASPEP percentages of sworn local employees were 
within 15 percentage points of the CSLLEA sworn percentages. 
Due to different ASPEP and CSLLEA classifications, the reported
number of nonsworn officers differed significantly between
the two collections in states in which local sheriffs’ offices 
had little law enforcement functions. Some states relied on 
sheriffs’ offices to perform sworn law enforcement functions, 
while sheriff employees in other states were primarily 
responsible for nonsworn functions.

Therefore, state-level differences in law enforcement
organizations and functions should also be considered when
determining which data source is best suited for various
research purposes. The most complete law enforcement employment 
data source may vary across states, depending on the 
organizational structure and functions of law enforcement
agencies in the state, whether the state’s reporting systems 
are compatible with the UCR, and how closely law enforcement
agency definition by source aligns with the law enforcement
structure in the state. As stated previously, the ASPEP’s ratio
of sworn law enforcement officers to 1,000 U.S. residents in
Massachusetts and Arizona were greater than in the other two
collections. This was contrary to the national rate of sworn 
law enforcement officers, which found the ASPEP rate to be 
lower than those produced by the UCR and CSLLEA. Massachusetts
and Arizona may have fewer specialized law enforcement
agencies that were excluded from the ASPEP, such as school
districts that employ police officers.

UCR and CSLLEA data may be used in combination with other
sources, such as the National Directory of Law Enforcement
Agencies, to develop a comprehensive roster of law enforcement
agencies in the United States. It has been difficult to develop
and maintain this roster from one source alone because of--

* the voluntary nature of submitting data to the UCR along
with reporting methods that resulted in one agency reporting
for multiple agencies

* the fact that ASPEP data were not maintained at the agency
level

*  the 4-year interval between CSLLEA administrations, during
which time a number of smaller agencies were likely to be
created or subsumed under larger agencies

* the need to develop and follow one common definition of
what constitutes a law enforcement agency and a sworn law
enforcement officer.

To answer key policy and research questions, it is critical to
have a national and regularly updated roster of law enforcement
agencies in the United States. For example, the currently 
available data cannot be used to compare the number and 
functions of law enforcement officers to public safety and
indicators of social and economic health. Also, there is
currently no thorough accounting of the number and type of
agencies that serve the same or overlapping jurisdictions. Such
information could greatly inform research on the overlapping
or supporting role of tribal and local police agencies, explore
the extent to which concurrent jurisdictional responsibilities 
are outlined in agency policies or memoranda of understanding,
and lead to a better understanding of the nature and extent of
conflicts that may occur between state and local agencies with
overlapping jurisdictions.
