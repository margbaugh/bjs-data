Highlights

Number of HIV-infected inmates steadily decreasing since 1999

*  Between 1998 and 2002 the number of HIV-positive prisoners decreased about
7%, while the overall prison population grew almost 11%.

*  At yearend 2002, 3.0% of all female State prison inmates were HIV positive,
compared to 1.9% of males.

*  During 2002, 19 States reported a decrease in the number of HIV-positive
prisoners, and 23 States reported an increase.

*  New York held a fifth of all inmates (5,000 inmates) known to be HIV
positive at yearend 2002.

*  In 2002 the overall rate of confirmed AIDS in the prison population (0.48%)
was nearly 3½  times the rate in the U.S. general population (0.14%).

*  Among jail inmates in 2002 who had ever been tested for HIV, Hispanics
(2.9%) were more than 3 times as likely as whites (0.8%) and twice as likely
as blacks (1.2%) to report being HIV positive.

*  Among jail inmates reporting past drug use, 1.5% were HIV positive; of
those who had used a needle to inject drugs, 3.2%; and of those who had shared
a needle with others, 7.5%.

Number of AIDS-related deaths in State prisons decreased in 2002

*  In 2002, 342 inmates died from AIDS-related causes -- 283 State prisoners,
17 Federal prisoners, and 42 jail inmates.

*  The number of AIDS-related deaths in State prisons decreased 72% between
1995 and 2002.

*  Based on reports from NPS-1 and the newly implemented Deaths in Custody
Act, 68 additional AIDS-related deaths were identified in 2002; 55 in 2001.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

On December 31, 2002, 2.0% of State prison inmates and 1.1% of Federal prison
inmates were known to be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Correctional authorities reported that 22,317 State inmates and 1,547 Federal
inmates were HIV positive. The number known to be HIV positive totaled 23,864,
down from 24,147 at yearend 2001.

Of those known to be HIV positive in all U.S. prisons at yearend 2002, an
estimated 5,643 were confirmed AIDS cases, down from 6,286 in 2001. Among
State inmates, 0.5% had AIDS; among Federal inmates, 0.4%.

In personal interviews conducted in 2002, nearly two-thirds of local jail
inmates reported ever being tested for HIV; of those, 1.3% disclosed that
they were HIV positive.

During 2002, 283 State prisoners died from AIDS-related causes (down from 311
in 2001); 17 Federal prisoners (down from 22 in 2001); and 42 local jail
inmates (down from 55).

HIV/AIDS data for prisoners are from the National Prisoner Statistics (NPS-1)
and for jail inmates from the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails. Data on
deaths are based on the Deaths in Custody Reporting Act collection (DICRA),
which began in 2000 for jail inmates and in 2001 for State prisoners. (See
Methodology for details.)

Number of HIV-infected prison inmates at yearend 2002, 
down from 2001

At yearend 2002, 23,864 inmates in State and Federal prisons were known to be
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), down from 24,147 in
2001. Among State prison inmates, 22,317 were known to be HIV positive; among
Federal inmates, 1,547. 

HIV-infected inmates were concentrated in a small number of States. New York
(5,000), Florida (2,848), and Texas (2,528) held the largest number of
HIV-positive inmates. These three States housed nearly half of all HIV-
infected inmates in State prisons in 2002. 

New York has estimated the number of HIV-infected inmates using data obtained
through blinded sero-prevalence studies conducted biennially by the New York
Department of Health.**New York draws blood from all entering inmates. Every
other year an extra sample from 1,000 sequential receptions in each of 4
reception centers is tested for various diseases including HIV. The percentage
with HIV-infection is applied to the total inmate population and then adjusted
for length of stay and findings from other studies. Projections are made for
the interim years without the blinded studies.**  The trend in HIV-infection
among prisoners is affected by these estimated numbers in New York. Excluding
New York, the number of HIV-infected inmates has been stable among the other
States. Between 1998 and 2002 the number has fluctuated between 18,180 and
19,333.

---------------------------------------------
HIV-positive inmates constituted 2.0% of the State prison population in
2002, down from 2.3% in 1998. In Federal prisons HIV-positive inmates
constituted 1.1% in 2002. Overall, the percentage of the total prison
population with HIV remained unchanged between 2001 and 2002.

Inmates in the Northeast had the highest rate of HIV infection

In the Northeast 4.6% of the prison population were known to be HIV
positive in 2002, followed by 2.2% in the South, 1.0% in the Midwest, 
and 0.7% in the West. New York had the highest percent of inmates 
known to be HIV positive (7.5%), followed by Maryland (4.0%) and 
Florida (3.8%)

Vermont, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming reported
fewer than 10 HIV-positive inmates in their prisons. In 2002 every
reporting jurisdiction held at least one HIV-positive inmate. Eight 
States reported that fewer than 0.5% of their inmate population were 
HIV positive. 

Between 2001 and 2002, 19 States reported a decrease in the number of
HIV-positive inmates. Excluding New York, the largest decrease was
reported in California -- 1,181 in 2002, down from 1,305 in 2001.
Twenty-three States and the Federal system reported an increase. The
largest increases were reported in Florida (up 246), Texas (140),
Maryland (127), and Pennsylvania (65). 

A greater percentage of females than males 
with HIV infection 

On December 31, 2002, 19,297 male inmates and 2,053 female inmates
in State prisons were known to be HIV positive. Overall, 1.9% of male
inmates and 3.0% of all female inmates were known to be HIV positive.
New York reported the largest numbers of male and female HIV-positive
inmates (4,590 and 410, respectively). The second largest numbers of
HIV-positive male and female inmates were in Florida (2,508 and 340,
respectively), followed by Texas (2,261 and 267, respectively). Four
States (Vermont, Minnesota, North Dakota, and Oregon) reported having
no HIV-positive female inmates. Every reporting State had at least one
HIV-positive male inmate.

Over 10% of all female inmates were known to be HIV positive in two
States, New York (13.6%) and Maryland (12.1%). New York (with 7.2%)
was the only State with more than 5% of the male inmates known to be
HIV positive.
-----------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------
Number of HIV-positive male and female inmates in 
State prisons declined during 2002 

In States that did not provide a breakdown of the number of HIV 
cases by gender, estimates were made using the data reported 
from the most recent year. Based on these yearend estimates, the 
number of HIV-infected females in State prisons decreased from 
2,212 to 2,164 in 2002. The number of infected male inmates
decreased from 20,415 to 20,273 in 2002. The estimated number 
of both male and female State inmates has declined since 1998. 
Between 1998 and 2002 the percentage of male HIV-positive inmates 
decreased from 2.2% to 1.9%, as the percentage of female inmates 
fell from 3.8% to 2.9%.

Confirmed AIDS cases in U.S. prisons decreased 
during 2002

At the end of 2002, a reported 4,898 inmates in U.S. prisons had
confirmed AIDS, down from 5,754 in 2001. Among those with confirmed
AIDS, 4,354 were in State prisons, and 544 were in Federal prisons.  

Because some States each year did not provide a breakdown of the
number of HIV cases by type of HIV infection, estimates of the 
number of confirmed AIDS cases were made for those States to provide
comparable year-to-year data. Based on yearly estimates, the number 
of confirmed AIDS cases decreased from 6,286 in 2001 to 5,643 in 2002. 

Between 1998 and 2002, 33 States and the Federal system consistently
reported the number of inmates with confirmed AIDS. As with the
reported and estimated numbers, the comparable number of inmates
with confirmed AIDS declined between 1998 and 2002, from 5,864 to
4,571. 
--------------------------------------------

Confirmed AIDS cases made up 0.5% of inmates in State prisons and 0.4% of
those in Federal prisons. Of those known to be HIV-positive inmates, about 
1 in 5 had confirmed AIDS.

The States with the largest number of confirmed AIDS cases were New York
(860), Texas (559), and Florida (520). Combined, these States held nearly 
half of all confirmed AIDS cases in State prisons. The Federal system held 
544 inmates with confirmed AIDS. Thirteen States reported having fewer than 
10 confirmed AIDS cases in their prisons; 4 reported having none.

Connecticut (1.4%) reported the highest percentage of confirmed AIDS, followed
by New York (1.3%), Massachusetts (1.1%), Maryland (1.1%), and South Carolina
(1.1%). In 18 States confirmed AIDS cases comprised 0.1% or less of State
inmates.

During 2002, 14 States reported a decrease in the number of confirmed AIDS
cases. Both New York and Texas, with a decrease of 300, had the largest drop
in the number of confirmed AIDS cases. Sixteen States reported an increase in
the number of confirmed AIDS cases, led by Alabama, up from 26 in 2001 to 81
in 2002.

Rate of confirmed AIDS 3½ times higher among prison 
inmates than U.S. general population

In every year since 1991, the rate of confirmed AIDS has been higher among
prison inmates than in the general population. At yearend 2002 the rate of
confirmed AIDS in State and Federal prisons was about 3½ times higher than 
in the total U.S. population. About 48 in every 10,000 prison inmates had
confirmed AIDS, compared to 14 per 10,000 persons in the U.S. general
population. 

AIDS-related deaths in State prisons 
dropped from 1995 to 2002
 
The number of State inmates who died of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,
Kaposi's sarcoma, or other AIDS-related diseases peaked in 1995 and steadily
decreased until 2001. According to data reported in the NPS-1, the number of
AIDS-related deaths (215) in 2002 was less than that in 2001 (256). Overall,
after 1995 the number of AIDS-related deaths was down 795 from 1,010 in 1995
to 215 in 2002. 

Among Federal inmates 17 died from AIDS-related causes, down from 22 in 2001.
In 2002 for every 100,000 inmates, 11 died from AIDS-related causes. These
AIDS-related deaths accounted for 5% of all deaths in Federal prison.

The introduction of protease inhibitors and combination antiretroviral
therapies produced a substantial improvement in the effectiveness of HIV/AIDS
care. (See Hammett and Harmon, "Medical Treatment and a Continuum of Care" in
1996-1997 Update: HIV/AIDS, STDs and TB in Correctional Facilities, July 1999,
NCJ 176344.) 

New reporting system identifies more AIDS-related 
deaths in State prisons

Pursuant to The Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000, BJS began in 2001
collecting information about deaths in custody in State prisons (DICRA). This
data collection is based on individual level death records. Death records for
2001 and 2002 have identified more AIDS-related deaths than the NPS-1.
Overall, 15 States under-reported AIDS-related deaths in the NPS-1 collection,
while 8 States under-reported AIDS-related deaths in DICRA.

To get a total count of the number of AIDS-related deaths in prisons, data
from DICRA were combined with data from the NPS-1. The most complete data for
each State's number of deaths were used to calculate the totals for 2001 and
2002. An additional 68 AIDS-related deaths were identified in 2002 and 55 in
2001. Adjusted for underreporting, the number of AIDS-related deaths per
100,000 State prison inmates in 2002 totaled 22, down from 25 per 100,000 in
2001.

In 2001 for the first time since 1995, the percentage of deaths due to AIDS
increased in the general population, although it remained lower than that
among State prisoners. The percentage of deaths due to AIDS was more than 2
times higher in the prison population than in the U.S. general population 
ages 15-54. In 2001 about 1 in every 10 prisoner deaths were attributable to
AIDS-related causes compared to 1 in 22 deaths in the general population.

About 1 in 11 deaths in State prisons 
due to AIDS-related illnesses

In 2002 an estimated 22 State prison inmates per 100,000 died from
AIDS-related causes. The most AIDS deaths were reported in the South
(151), followed by the Northeast (74). These two regions accounted for
more than three-quarters of AIDS-related deaths in State prisons.

New York reported the largest number of AIDS-related deaths (38), followed 
by Florida (36) and California (26). Seventeen States reported having no
AIDS-related deaths.

Relative to the number of inmates, New York reported the highest rate of
AIDS-related death (57 per 100,000), followed by Vermont (56 per 100,000),
Florida (49 per 100,000), and Maryland (45 per 100,000). 

AIDS-related deaths reported in DICRA show variations 
by gender, race/Hispanic origin, and age 

Of the 245 inmates who died of AIDS-related causes in 2002, 236 were male and
9 were female. About half of all AIDS-related deaths were accounted for by
inmates between ages 35 and 44  (119). AIDS-related deaths among black inmates
(163) accounted for two-thirds of all AIDS-related deaths. Over the 2-year
period a total of 594 State prison inmates died from AIDS-related illnesses. 

Relative to the total number of inmates in custody in 2002, males (21 deaths
per 100,000) were nearly twice as likely as females (11 per 100,000) to die
from AIDS-related causes; black inmates (30 per 100,000) were twice as likely
as Hispanics (15 per 100,000) and 2½ times as likely as whites (12 per
100,000) to die from AIDS-related causes. Inmates age 45 or older had the
highest rates of AIDS-related death (64 per 100,000), nearly double the rate
among those age 35 to 44, and 10 times the rate among those age 25 to 34. 

HIV/AIDS reported by jail inmates in 
personal interviews

The 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails asked inmates if they had ever
been tested for HIV, if they had been tested since admission for HIV, and
whether they were HIV positive. (See Methodology for further detail.)
Though some inmates may refuse to report that they are HIV positive and
others may not know, surveys provide a means to track HIV infection among
demographic and "high-risk" groups. 

About 1 in 5 jail inmates reported being 
tested for HIV after admission

Of those inmates who indicated that they were tested after admission to jail,
2.5% reported being HIV positive. Nearly two-thirds of jail inmates reported
ever being tested for HIV; 1.3% of those inmates disclosed that they were HIV
positive.

Among jail inmates who were tested for HIV, Hispanic inmates (2.9%) were more
than 3 times as likely as white inmates (0.8%) and more than twice as likely
as black inmates (1.2%) to report being HIV positive. Female inmates (2.3%)
were more likely than male inmates (1.2%) to be HIV positive. Hispanic male
inmates (2.9%) were as likely as Hispanic female inmates (2.9%) to be infected
with HIV. White female inmates (1.6%) were twice as likely as white male
inmates (0.6%) to be HIV-positive; black non-Hispanic female inmates (3.0%)
were 3 times as likely as black male inmates (1.0%).

Among male inmates, blacks (1.0%) were nearly twice as likely as whites (0.6%)
to be HIV positive. The rate of HIV infection among white female inmates
(1.6%) was nearly half that of black (3.0%) and Hispanic female inmates
(2.9%). 

Jail inmates age 24 or younger reported the lowest rate of being HIV positive
(0.2%), followed by those age 25-34 (1.1%), those 35-44 (2.1%), and those 45
or older (2.7%).

Property and drug offenders most likely to report 
being HIV positive

Those inmates held for a property offense in local jails reported the highest
HIV positive rate (1.8% ) . Drug offenders reported a slightly lower rate
(1.6%). The percentage of public-order offenders who were HIV positive was
1.1%; the percentage of violent offenders, 0.7%. 

The percentage of jail inmates reporting that they were HIV positive varied by
level of prior drug use. Of jail  inmates who reported never using drugs, 0.4%
were HIV positive. An estimated 1.5% of inmates who had ever used drugs, 1.5%
of those who used drugs in the month before their current offense, 3.2% of
those who had used a needle to inject drugs, and 7.5% of those who had shared
a needle reported being HIV positive. 

The number of AIDS-related deaths in jails declined 
between 2000 and 2002

In 2002 the number of AIDS-related deaths in local jails was 42, down from 58
in 2000. The rate of AIDS-related deaths was down from 9 per 100,000 inmates
in 2000 to 6 per 100,000 in 2002. Of the 42 inmates who died from AIDS-related
illnesses in 2002, 38 were male and 4 were female. Those who died from
AIDS-related illnesses were most likely black (31 inmate deaths) and between
the ages 35 and 44 (21 inmate deaths). Over the 3-year period beginning in
2000, a total of 155 local jail inmates died from AIDS-related causes.

Methodology

National Prisoner Statistics

The National Prisoner Statistics series (NPS-1) includes yearend counts
of prisoners by jurisdiction, gender, race, Hispanic origin, and admissions
and releases during the year. The series consists of reports from the
departments of corrections of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and
the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Since 1991 respondents have indicated the
circumstances under which inmates are tested for HIV and have provided the
number of HIV-infected inmates in their custody.

Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, 2002

The 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails was conducted for BJS by the U.S.
Census Bureau. Through personal interviews conducted from January through
April, 2002, data were collected on individual characteristics of jail
inmates, current offenses, sentences and time served, criminal histories, 
jail activities, conditions and programs, prior drug and alcohol use and
treatment, and health care services provided while in jail. The sample for 
the 2002 survey was selected from a universe of 3,365 jails that were
enumerated in the 1999 Census of Jails. 

Overall, 465 jails were selected. Interviews were conducted in 420 jails;
38 refused and 7 were closed. A total of  6,982 inmates were interviewed,
and 768 refused to participate. Similar surveys of jail inmates were
conducted in 1972, 1978, 1983, 1989, and 1996.

The accuracy of the 2002 Survey of Inmates in Local Jails depends on sampling
and measurement errors. Sampling errors occur by chance because a sample
rather than a complete enumeration of the population was conducted.
Measurement error can be attributed to many sources, such as nonresponse,
recall difficulties, differences in the interpretation of questions among
inmates, and procession errors.

The sampling error, as measured by an estimated standard error, varies
by the size of the estimate and the size of the base population. Estimates
for the percentage of inmates ever tested for HIV and the percentage
who tested HIV positive have been calculated.  These standard errors
may be used to construct confidence intervals around percentages.  For
example, the 95-percent confidence interval around the percentage of
males in local jails who were HIV positive is approximately 1.2% plus or
minus 1.96 times .20% (or .8% to 1.6%).

Deaths in Custody Collections

In order to implement The Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (PL 106-297),
BJS has developed four data collections of death records covering the Nation's
criminal justice custodial populations. BJS began collection from local jails
in 2000, and added State prisons in 2001, State juvenile correctional agencies
in 2002, and State and local law enforcement agencies in 2003. These new
collections are conducted on a quarterly basis and provide BJS with individual
records for each death. Records include data on the deceased's individual
characteristics (such as age, gender, race/ Hispanic origin), criminal
background (such as legal status, offenses, time in custody), and the death
itself (such as cause, time, location, and medical conditions and treatment).
As a result, these new collections will provide the public with a richer
source of data on such deaths, and on a more frequent basis. 

AIDS in the U.S. resident population

The number of persons with confirmed AIDS in the U.S. general population (age
13 and older) was derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, yearend editions 1995-2002. For each year
the number of active AIDS cases in the United States was calculated by
subtracting the number of cumulative AIDS deaths for people age 15 or older at
yearend from the cumulative number of total AIDS cases for people age 13 or
older at yearend as listed in the HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report.

The rate of confirmed AIDS cases in the U.S. resident population was
calculated by dividing the annual totals for individuals with AIDS by the
population estimates for the U.S. resident population of individuals 13 or
older prior to 2000 and 15 or older for 2000 and beyond.

AIDS-related deaths in the United States

The number of AIDS-related deaths for persons age 15-54 was derived from the
CDC, HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report, yearend editions. Deaths in the U.S.
population for persons age 15-54 were taken from the CDC, Monthly Vital
Statistics Report, Vol. 45, No. 11(S); and from CDC, National Vital Statistics
Report, Vol. 47, No. 9; Vol. 47, No. 25; Vol. 48, No. 11; Vol. 49, No. 8; Vol.
50, No. 15; and Vol. 52, No. 3.

AIDS-related deaths as a percentage of all deaths in the U.S. population were
calculated by dividing the national estimate of AIDS deaths of persons age
15-54 by the national mortality estimates of persons age 15-54 in a given
year.
