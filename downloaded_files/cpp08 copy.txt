In 2008, an estimated 16.9% of U.S. residents age 16 or older
had face-to-face contact with police. This was a decline
from the 19.1% of U.S. residents who reported having
contact with police in 2005 and a decrease from the 21% who
experienced contact with police in 1999 and 2002 (figure 1).
Between 2002 and 2008, about 5.3 million fewer residents
had face-to-face contact with police, down to an estimated
40.0 million from 45.3 million. Among persons who had
a face-to-face contact with police in 2008, about 1 out of 4
had more than one contact during the year. The public most
commonly came into contact with police when driving a
vehicle that was pulled over in a traffic stop. Other frequent
reasons for contact with police included reporting a crime to
police or being involved in a traffic accident.

The findings described in this report are based on the
Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS) that the Bureau
of Justice Statistics (BJS) periodically uses to interview
all persons age 16 or older in a nationally representative
sample of households about their contacts with police
during the previous 12 months. The PPCS is a supplement
to the National Crime Victimization Survey. This report
summarizes data from the 2008 PPCS and compares
findings to the 2002 and 2005 surveys.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Highlights

* The percent of U.S. residents age 16 or older who had face 
to-face contact with police declined from 2002 (21.0%) to 
2005 (19.1%) and declined again in 2008 (16.9%).

* An estimated 9 out of 10 residents who had contact with
police in 2008 felt the police acted properly.

* The most common reason for contact with police in 2008
was being a driver in a traffic stop (44.1%).

* White (8.4%), black (8.8%), and Hispanic (9.1%) drivers were
stopped by police at similar rates in 2008.

* Male drivers (9.9%) were stopped at higher rates than
female drivers (7.0%).

* In 2008 about 5% of traffic stops led to a search. Police were
more likely to search male drivers than female drivers.

* Black drivers were about three times as likely as white
drivers and about two times as likely as Hispanic drivers to
be searched during a traffic stop.

* During traffic stops in 2008, about 57.7% of searches of the
driver only and 60.0% of searches of the vehicle only were
conducted with the driver's consent.

* About 36.1% of drivers who were only physically searched
and 20.7% of drivers who only had their vehicle searched
believed police had a legitimate reason to do so.

* Among persons who had contact with police in 2008, an
estimated 1.4% had force used or threatened against them
during their most recent contact, which was not statistically
different from the percentages in 2002 (1.5%) and 2005 (1.6%).

* A majority of the people who had force used or threatened
against them said they felt it was excessive.

Police-Public Contact Survey interviewed U.S.
households about their face-to-face interactions with
law enforcement officers

BJS conducted a pilot test of the PPCS in 1996 as a
supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey
(NCVS). The 1996 survey was administered to determine
whether the NCVS could serve as a useful method for
collecting data on contacts between U.S. residents and the
police and to obtain preliminary estimates on this topic.
The pilot survey revealed that about 21% of the public
experienced face-to-face contact with a police officer at least
once during 1996. Survey findings helped to inform the
development of an improved questionnaire. In addition to
the pilot study, a panel of law enforcement experts reviewed
and provided recommendations on the survey procedures
and questionnaire.

A revised version of the PPCS was fielded in 1999 among
a national sample nearly 15 times as large as the 1996 pilot
sample. The 1999 survey included a more detailed set of
questions about traffic stops by police, which was the most
frequent reason for contact with police. The 1999 survey
yielded estimates similar to those in the 1996 survey on the
prevalence and nature of contacts between the public and
the police.

Since 1999, the PPCS has been administered every 3 years
(in 2002, 2005, and 2008) as a supplement to the NCVS.
During the survey, U.S. residents age 16 or older were
asked whether they had a face-to-face interaction with a
law enforcement officer during the 12 months prior to their
interview. Survey respondents who said they had face-toface
contact with police were asked to describe the nature
and outcome of that contact. Persons who reported more
than one instance of face-to-face contact during the year
were asked to describe the most recent occurrence.

Contact with police excluded contact by telephone or
written correspondence, contact with private security
guards, social contact, or contact that occurred because of
employment or volunteer work that brought the respondent
into regular contact with police. In addition, members of
the household who were living in an institution at the time
of the interview--for instance, incarcerated persons--were
excluded from the PPCS sample. Such exclusions may
affect the findings because contact with police leading to
incarceration would involve more serious outcomes.
This report summarizes the results of the 2008 PPCS and
provides comparative analysis with findings from the
surveys conducted in 2002 and 2005. (See Methodology for
information on the reasons for limiting certain comparisons
to these 3 years.) The findings are based solely on the
personal accounts of the PPCS respondents. Official police
records on contacts between police and the public were
not used in the study. Data collected and described in the
report cannot provide a sufficient basis to infer a causal
relationship between characteristics of the respondent and
police behavior.

In comparisons described in the text, an explicit or implied
difference indicates that BJS conducted tests of statistical
significance, and the difference was significant at the 95%
confidence level or above. Certain differences were not
significant at or above the 95% level, but were significant
at the 90% confidence level. The terms "somewhat,"
"some indication," "some evidence," or "slightly" refer to
differences significant at the 90% level. (See Methodology
for more information on confidence intervals and statistical
significance tests.)

Number of persons who had contact with police
declined between 2002 and 2008

In 1999, an estimated 20.9% of U.S. residents age 16 or
older experienced face-to-face contact at least once with a
police officer. About the same percentage of contact between
police and residents (21.0%) occurred in 2002. About 19.1%
of residents had face-to-face contact with police in 2005,
a decrease from the percentage who had police contact in
2002. In 2008, the percentage of residents who experienced
contact with police further decreased to 16.9%.

Overall, about 5.3 million fewer residents had face-to-face
contact with police during 2008, compared to the total
number who had contact in 2002 (table 1). An estimated 45.3
million residents age 16 or older had police contact in 2002,
while about 40.0 million had contact with the police in 2008.

While the second most common reason for contact with
police during this period continued to be reporting a crime
or problem, the percentage of all contacts that occurred for
this reason decreased from 26.4% in 2002 to 23.7% in 2005
and 20.9% in 2008 (table 2). Nearly 12 million residents
said their most recent contact in 2002 was to report a crime
or problem to police, compared to about 8.3 million (or
30.2% fewer) residents in 2008. The decline in these contacts
accounted for about 3.6 million (69%) of the 5.3 million
fewer contacts residents had in 2008 compared to 2002.
The drop in the number of residents reporting crimes or
other problems to police was consistent with findings from
the NCVS that showed a decline in criminal victimization
during this period. Between 1999 and 2008, the violent crime
rate declined by 41%, and the property crime rate fell by 32%.
*** Footnote 1 Criminal Victimization, 2008, NCJ 227777, 
September 2009 (http://www.bjs.gov).***

In 2002, 2005, and 2008, more than half of residents reported
that their most recent contact with police was the result of a
traffic stop or accident. The most common reason for police
contact all 3 years was a person driving a vehicle that police
stopped. Overall, the portion of all contacts that occurred
as the result of being a driver in a traffic stop increased from
37.1% in 2002 to 41.0 in 2005 and 44.1% in 2008.

Among residents age 16 or older in 2002, the rate of contact
that occurred to report a crime or other problem was 5.5%
(table 3). This rate decreased to 3.5% in 2008. The rate of
contact with police for being a person driving a vehicle that
police stopped was 7.8% in 2002 and 7.5% in 2008. The
difference between these percentages was not statistically
significant.

Overall, there was no discernable statistical difference between
the number of persons whose most recent contact was as a
driver in a traffic stop in 2002 (16.8 million) and 2008 (17.7
million) (table 4). While the difference between the number
of male drivers stopped by police in 2002 and 2008 was not
statistically significant, the number of female drivers stopped
by police increased nearly 12% during this period. The
number of white and black drivers stopped by police during
their most recent contact did not increase between 2002
and 2008. Among Hispanic drivers, the number of residents
stopped by police increased nearly 28%.

A decline in the number of persons whose most recent
contact with police was to report a crime or other problem
between 2002 and 2008 was found among both males
and females. White, black, and Hispanic residents also
experienced a drop in the number of face-to-face contacts
that occurred from reporting a crime or problem during this
period.

Males had contact with police at higher rates than
females

The percentage of males experiencing face-to-face contact
with police was higher than the percentage of females in
2008 (table 5). Among residents age 16 or older, persons
ages 18 to 24 experienced the highest percentage of police
contact in 2008. White residents experienced a higher rate
of contact with police than black and Hispanic residents in
2008. These differences were consistent with findings from
the 2002 and 2005 surveys.

In 2005 the racial categories changed from previous
years of the PPCS to separately identify persons of other
races (American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Asians, Native
Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders) and those of any race
indicating two or more races. In 2005 and 2008, the PPCS
found that whites were more likely than Asians, Native
Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders to have contact with
police. Whites did not have a higher rate of police contact than
American Indians and Alaskan Natives in 2005 or in 2008.

Similar patterns were found in the demographic
composition of persons who had contact with police in
2002, 2005, and 2008. Males accounted for just over half
of all persons who had contact with police during these
three years (table 6). White residents made up about threequarters
of contacts, and black residents made up about
1 out of 10 persons who had police contact. Hispanic
residents also accounted for about 1 out of 10 persons who
had contact with police in 2002, 2005, and 2008.

About a quarter of persons with contact in 2008 had
more than one contact during the year

Among persons who had face-to-face contact with police
during 2008, about 1 out of 4 (25.1%) experienced contact
more than once during the year (table 7). Among the 40.0
million persons who had contact with the police in 2008,
nearly 67.0 million encounters occured with an average of
1.7 contacts per resident who experienced police contact.

A greater percentage of males (26.9%) than females (23.0%)
who had police contact in 2008 experienced more than one
contact during the year. Among persons who had contact
with police in 2008, black residents (28.4%) were somewhat
more likely than white residents (24.6%) and more likely than
Asian, Native Hawaiians, and other Pacific Islanders (20.4%)
to have multiple contacts. Persons ages 18 to 24 were more
likely than older age groups to experience multiple contacts
during 2008.

A majority of survey respondents said they felt the
police acted properly during face-to-face contact

As was the case in 2002 (90.1%) and 2005 (90.4%), the vast
majority of residents (89.7%) with police contact during
2008 felt the officer or officers acted properly. *** Footnote 2
Findings come from the 2002 and 2005 Contacts between 
Police and the Public reports.  See Methodology.*** In addition,
 about 9 out of 10 (91.8%) residents who experienced a contact 
in 2008 reported that the police were respectful (table 8).

Overall, most white, black, and Hispanic residents who had
contact with police felt the officer or officers acted properly.
Opinions about police behavior varied across reasons for
contact. For instance, persons who police suspected of wrongdoing 
or who had contact through a criminal investigation (78.5%) were
less likely than those who had contact with police during a traffic 
accident (92.6%) to feel police behaved properly. Blacks (69.6%) 
and Hispanics (62.3%) were less likely than whites (82.3%) to 
believe police acted properly during contacts that occurred because
police were investigating a crime or suspected the person of wrong
doing. For those who had contact with police in the context of a traffic
accident, no differences were found in the estimated percentage of 
whites, blacks, and Hispanics who felt the police acted properly.

Drivers in 2008 were stopped by police at rates similar
to those in 2002 and 2005

In 2008, an estimated 17.7 million persons age 16 or older indicated
that their most recent contact occurred as a driver pulled over in a 
traffic stop (table 9). These contacts include stops of all kinds 
of motor vehicles--for example, motorcycles, buses, and private 
and commercial cars and trucks--being used for both personal 
and business travel. Of the estimated 209.2 million who drove 
during 2008, the 17.7 million drivers stopped by police represented
8.4%--nearly 1 out of 12 drivers. An additional 1.7 million individuals 
were stopped by police at some point during the 12-month period, 
but had experienced more recent contact in a different context. 
In total, an estimated 9.2% of all drivers, about 19.3 million, were 
stopped at least once by police in 2008.

Overall, drivers in 2008 (8.4%) were stopped by police at a
rate similar to that of 2002 (8.8%) and 2005 (8.8%). A greater
percentage of male drivers (9.9%) than female drivers (7.0%)
were stopped by police during 2008. Drivers between the
ages of 16 and 29 had a greater likelihood than other age
groups of being pulled over by police. These differences
were consistent with findings from the 2002 and 2005
surveys. White (8.4%), black (8.8%), and Hispanic (9.1%)
drivers were stopped by police at similar rates in 2008.
White, black, and Hispanic drivers were also stopped at
similar rates in 2002 and 2005.

In 2008 white drivers (8.4%) were more likely than Asian,
Native Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander drivers to be
stopped (6.3%), but somewhat less likely than American
Indian or Alaskan Native drivers (12.6%) to be stopped by
police. The likelihood of being stopped by police in 2005 did
not differ significantly among white drivers (8.9%), American
Indian or Alaskan Native drivers (11.9%), and Asian, Native
Hawaiian, and other Pacific Islander drivers (7.9%).

Speeding was the reason for about half of all traffic stops

The PPCS includes a detailed set of questions for
respondents whose most recent contact with police occurred
as a driver in a traffic stop. When drivers were asked what
reason the officer gave for the traffic stop, the most frequent
reason was exceeding the speed limit, cited by about half of
drivers stopped in 2002 (54.8%), 2005 (53.7%), and 2008
(50.2%) (table 10). About 1 in 10 drivers were stopped for
vehicle defects, such as a burned out headlight or a loud
muffler, in 2002 (9.3%), 2005 (9.5%) and 2008 (12.0%).

Most drivers pulled over by police believed they were
stopped for a legitimate reason

An estimated 84.5% of drivers pulled over by police in 2008
felt they had been stopped for a legitimate reason (table 11).
More than 80% of stopped drivers in 2002 (84%) and 2005
(86%) also believed police had a legitimate reason for pulling
them over in a traffic stop.*** Footnote 3 Findings come from
the 2002 and 2005 Contacts between Police and the Public reports. 
See Methodology.***


In 2008, about 73.8% of black drivers believed police had a
legitimate reason for stopping them compared to 86.3% of
white and 82.5% of Hispanic drivers. Opinions also varied
across reasons for traffic stop. Overall a higher proportion
of drivers stopped for speeding (90.0%) believed they were
stopped for a legitimate reason compared with those stopped
for a vehicle defect (82.6%). These proportions varied by
race and Hispanic origin. An estimated 78.7% of black
drivers stopped for speeding felt they were pulled over for a
legitimate reason, compared to 88.7% of Hispanic and 91.8%
of white drivers. Among traffic stops for vehicle defects,
black drivers (60.7%) were less likely than Hispanic (84.3%)
and white (86.8%) drivers to feel they were pulled over for a
legitimate reason.

A majority of stopped drivers were issued a traffic
ticket

An estimated 26.7% of stopped drivers received either a
written (17.0%) or verbal (9.7%) warning during the traffic
stop (table 12). Police issued a traffic ticket to 55.4% of the
drivers and arrested 2.6%. No enforcement action was taken
for approximately 15.3% of stopped drivers, meaning they
did not receive a verbal or written warning nor were they
ticketed or arrested.

Police ticketed the majority of drivers stopped for speeding
(68.6%), a seat belt violation (70.3%), an illegal lane change
(52.7%), or a stop light or stop sign violation (58.4%).
By comparison, the majority of drivers stopped during a
roadside sobriety check reported having no enforcement
action taken (68.5%).

Police were equally likely to issue tickets to males (55.9%)
and females (54.9%) during a traffic stop (table 13). Males
(3.5%) were more likely than females (1.4%) to be arrested
following a traffic stop, whereas females were somewhat
more likely to receive a written or verbal warning.

A greater percentage of black (4.7%) than white (2.4%)
drivers were arrested during a traffic stop. Black drivers
(58.3%) were somewhat more likely than white drivers
(53.1%) to be ticketed during a stop. An equal percentage
of Hispanic (2.6%) and white (2.4%) drivers were arrested
following a traffic stop, while a greater percentage of
Hispanic drivers (62.9%) than white drivers (53.1%) received
a ticket. In addition, a greater percentage of white drivers
(11.2%) received a verbal warning from police, compared to
Hispanic (4.5%) and black (6.0%) drivers.

Drivers ages 20 to 29 were more likely than drivers age 50 or
older to be ticketed by police during a traffic stop. Drivers
ages 20 to 29 (4.4%) were also more likely than drivers ages
40 to 49 (1.5%), 50 to 59 (1.3%), and drivers age 60 or older
(1.5%) to be arrested during a traffic stop. Due to sample
size limitations, further analysis could not be done on police
enforcement actions during traffic stops sorted by reason for
stop and drivers' race, sex, and age demographics.

About 5% of drivers were searched during traffic stops
During a traffic stop, police sometimes conducted a search
for illicit drugs, open containers of alcohol, stolen property,
or other evidence of criminal wrongdoing. In about 5%
(870,000) of the traffic stops documented in the 2008 PPCS,
police conducted a search of the driver, the vehicle, or both
(table 14). The 2008 PPCS data show that 

* Police were more likely to conduct a search of the vehicle
or driver in traffic stops with male drivers (7.4%) than
female drivers (1.6%).

* Black drivers (12.3%) were about three times as likely
as white drivers (3.9%) and about two times as likely as
Hispanic drivers (5.8%) to be searched during a traffic
stop.

* Drivers ages 20 to 29 (9.0%) were more likely than drivers
ages 30 to 39 (4.5%), 40 to 49 (2.5%), or 50 to 59 (2.5%),
and drivers 60 or older (1.6%) to be physically searched or
have their vehicle searched.

The 2002 and 2005 surveys also found that about 5% of stopped
drivers were searched by police during the traffic stop. Among
drivers stopped by police in 2002 and 2005, males were more
likely than females and blacks and Hispanics were more likely
than whites to be searched during a traffic stop.

About 1 out of 10 searches conducted during traffic
stops uncovered illegal items

Among the estimated 870,000 searches of the driver, vehicle,
or both in 2008, about 187,000 were searches only of the
driver, 226,000 were searches only of the vehicle, and 458,000
were searches of both the driver and the vehicle (table 15). An
estimated 57.7% of driver-only (driver physically searched,
frisked, or patted down by police) and 60.0% of vehicle-only
searches were consent searches. About 50.8% of searches of
both the driver and vehicle were conducted with consent.
Consent searches occured because either the officer asks
permission to perform a search and the driver then granted
it, or the driver volunteered to allow the officer to conduct a
search.

Searches conducted without consent may occur because the
police officer fails to ask permission before conducting the
search, the officer asks but the driver refuses, or the search is
conducted as a result of an arrest. Among drivers searched
and arrested during a traffic stop, about 42.8% were searched
after the arrest, and 57.2% were searched before the arrest
(not shown in table).

An estimated 2.1% of driver-only searches and 1.6% of
vehicle-only searches conducted in 2008 discovered evidence
of criminal behavior (e.g., drugs, illegal weapons, open
containers of alcohol, or other illegal items). When both the
driver and vehicle were searched, evidence was uncovered
about 14.3% of the time. Evidence was discovered in an
estimated 8.4% of searches of a vehicle, driver, or both (not
shown in table).

No comparisons of the number of searches that yielded
criminal evidence were made between drivers of different
gender, age, and race categories, as many of the samples on
which the separate categories were based were too small to
form reliable estimates.

Approximately 1 out of 5 drivers (20.7%) who had only their
vehicle searched believed police had a legitimate reason to
do so. An estimated 36.1% of drivers who had only their
person searched and 21.7% of individuals who had both
their person and vehicle searched indicated that police had a
legitimate reason to do so.

Most searches conducted during a traffic stop occurred
at night

Overall, a larger percentage of traffic stops documented in
the 2008 PPCS occurred during the day (67.3%) (6 a.m.
to 6 p.m.) than at night (32.7%) (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) (table
16). However, a majority of traffic stops involving a search
(59.7%) or an arrest (68.1%) occurred at night. Among
drivers who experienced the use or threat of force by police
during a traffic stop, the percentage of stops that occurred
at night (60.5%) was slightly larger than the percentage of
daytime stops (39.5%).

Males, blacks and younger persons were more likely to
have a contact with police in 2008 that resulted in the
use of force

An estimated 776,000 persons experienced force or the
threat of force by police at least once in 2008 (table 17). This
total represented an estimated 1.9% of the approximately
40.0 million people experiencing face-to-face police contact
during 2008. The 2008 PPCS included detailed questions
about use-of-force incidents, including the types of force
police might have used and whether the respondent thought
the amount of force used or threatened was excessive.
Respondents who reported more than one contact during
2008 were asked about the use or threat of force by police
during their most recent contact that year.

During 2008, about 574,000 persons age 16 or older
had force used or threatened against them during their
most recent contact with police (table 18). This estimate
represents about 1.4% of those persons who reported faceto-
face contact with police in 2008. The difference between
the percentages of contacts involving police use of force
in 2002 (1.5%), 2005 (1.6%), and 2008 (1.4%) were not
statistically significant.

Males were more likely than females to have force used or
threatened against them during their most recent contact
with police during 2002, 2005, and 2008. Blacks were more
likely than whites or Hispanics to experience use or threat
of force in 2008. In 2002 and 2005, blacks and Hispanics
were more likely than whites to experience the use or threat
of force during contact with police. Individuals between
the ages of 16 and 29 were more likely than those age 30
or older to experience contact that resulted in force or the
threat of force in 2002, 2005, and 2008. Due to sample size
limitations, analysis could not be done on the likelihood of
experiencing force according to the reason for the contact
and race, sex, and age differences.

Most persons who experienced force felt it was
excessive

Residents who experienced a police contact that involved
force were asked if they felt any of the physical force used
or threatened against them was excessive. The PPCS did not
define excessive for the respondent. Most (74.3% or about
417,000) people whose most recent contact with police in
2008 involved force or the threat of force thought those
actions were excessive (table 19). Among persons who had
a contact that involved force or the threat of force in 2008,
no differences were found in the percentage of white, black,
and Hispanic individuals who described the incident as
excessive.

More than half of police use-of-force incidents
involved the police pushing or grabbing the individual
Survey respondents who said they experienced the use or
threat of force by police in 2008 were asked to describe the
incident. Some respondents reported that more than one
tyhad force used or threatened against them, an estimated
76.6% reported that police threatened to use force during
the incident (table 20). An estimated 75.5% of police-use-of 
force incidents involved the officer or officers shouting at the
respondent. About half (53.5%) of the police-use-of-force
cases involved the respondent being pushed or grabbed by
police. About 1 out of 4 (25.6%) respondents who reported
that force was used or threatened during the contact said
police pointed a gun at them.

Among persons who experienced the use or threat of force
by police and characterized it as excessive, about 60% were
pushed or grabbed by police. The police kicked or hit the
respondent during an estimated 17.2% of incidents involving
the threat or use of excessive force.

Overall, about 3 out of 4 (74.3%) persons who experienced
the use or threat of force in 2008 felt it was excessive
(table 21). Among those persons involved in situations in
which force was actually applied by police (e.g., grabbing,
hitting, using chemical spray, or pointing a gun), an
estimated 80.6% believed the actions were excessive. Of
respondents who reported that police only threatened force
during the incident, about 74% felt it was excessive. Among
individuals who reported the use or threat of force only
involved police shouting or cursing at them, 42.9% felt that
those actions were excessive.

Individuals who had contact with police were asked
about their behavior during the incident. Among persons
experiencing police use or threat of force in 2008, an
estimated 21.9% reported that they argued with, cursed
at, insulted, or verbally threatened the police (table 22).
An estimated 11.6% of those involved in a force incident
reported disobeying or interfering with the police. About 5%
resisted being handcuffed, arrested, or searched by police.

Persons police suspected of wrongdoing or who had contact
through a criminal investigation represented a relatively
large percentage of the force incidents. Individuals police
suspected of wrongdoing accounted for 16.6% of the force
incidents compared to 2.5% of all contacts (table 23).
Persons whose contact occurred during a criminal
investigation accounted for 21.6% of force incidents,
compared to 5.6% of all contacts.

In 2008, 9.6% of persons who were suspected of wrongdoing
by police experienced the use or threat of force (table 24). By
comparison, persons who contacted police to report a crime
or another problem experienced force or the threat of force
less than 1% of the time.

More than half of persons who had force used or
threatened against them were searched by police

About 57% of those who had force used or threatened against
them by police were searched either before or after the force
occurred (table 25). An estimated 10.4% of persons who
experienced the use or threat of force reported that police
found illegal items, such as drugs or a weapon (not in table).
Among individuals who had force used against them in
2008, an estimated 54.3% were handcuffed and 39.9%
were arrested during the incident. The higher percentage
of persons handcuffed versus those arrested during force
incidents may be an indication that police sometimes used
handcuffs to detain people during contact and later released
them without making an arrest. Overall, 18.9% of persons
who experienced force in 2008 were injured during the
incident (not in table).

An estimated 83.9% of individuals who experienced force
or the threat of force felt that the police acted improperly.
Of those who experienced the use or threat of force in 2008
and felt the police acted improperly, 13.7% filed a complaint
against the police.

Methodology

Data collection

The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) is an
annual survey that collects data on crime against persons age
12 or older from a nationally representative, stratified, multistage
cluster sample of U.S. households. Since 1999, the
Police-Public Contact Survey (PPCS) has been administered
every 3 years as a supplemental survey to all persons ages
16 or older within households sampled for the NCVS. (For
more details on the NCVS, see Survey Methodology for
Criminal Victimization in the United States, 2007 at www.bjs.gov.)

The U.S. Census Bureau fielded the 2008 PPCS
questionnaire, processed the survey data, and provided
estimation specifications. The 2008 PPCS was pretested
in the spring of 2008 and conducted between July 1, 2008,
and December 31, 2008. Respondents were asked about
their contacts with police during the past 12 months. For
instance, persons interviewed in July 2008 were asked about
contacts that occurred between August 2007 and July 2008.
Those interviewed in August 2008 were asked about contacts
between September 2007 and August 2008.

In 2008 the PPCS interviewed 57,978 of the 72,566 eligible
individuals in the NCVS sample (table 26). Among the
PPCS interviews, 22,301 (38.5%) were conducted in person
and 35,677 (61.5%) were by telephone. A total of 14,588
nonrespondents who were excluded from the 2008 PPCS
as non-interviews or as proxy interviews. Non-interviews
(12,803) included respondents not available for the
interview, those who refused to participate, and non-English
speaking respondents. (Unlike the NCVS interviews, PPCS
interviews are conducted only in English.) The remaining
1,785 were proxy interviews representing household members
who were unable to participate for physical, mental, or other
reasons. After adjustment for nonresponse, the sample cases
in 2008 were weighted to produce a national population
estimate of 236,511,832 persons age 16 or older (table 27).

PPCS nonrespondents consisted of persons whose
household did not respond to the NCVS (NCVS household
nonresponse), persons within an interviewed NCVS
household who did not respond to the NCVS (NCVS person
nonresponse), and persons who responded to the NCVS but
did not complete the PPCS (PPCS person nonresponse). The
NCVS household response rate between July and December
2008 was 91%. The NCVS person response rate was 88%,
and the PPCS person response rate was 91%. The combined
NCVS and PPCS person response rate was 80%. The overall
weighted response rate for the 2008 PPCS (calculated by
multiplying the household response rate by the combined
NCVS-PPCS person response rate) was 73%.

To produce national estimates on police-public contacts,
sample weights were applied to the survey data so that the
respondents represented the entire population, including the
nonrespondents. Despite the nonresponse adjustments, low
overall response rates and response rates to particular survey
items can still increase variance in these estimates and
produce bias when the nonrespondents have characteristics
that differ from the respondents. The Office of Management
and Budget (OMB) guidelines require a nonresponse bias
study when the overall response rate is below 80%.

BJS and the Census Bureau compared the distributions of
respondents and nonrespondents and nonresponse estimates
for various household and demographic characteristics, and
examined their impact on the national estimates produced
for the 2008 PPCS. The study looked at household-level
and person-level response rates and found no significant
variation or bias in the rates among various population
groups. The largest bias among the household characteristics
was in region and type of location in urban areas; however,
these biases were reduced in the nonresponse adjustments.
The largest bias in person nonresponse was observed in the
Hispanic origin characteristics. Nonresponse statistics were
also computed for key survey questions from the PPCS, and
no evidence of bias was found during the analysis.

Follow-up interviews

PPCS respondents were asked about their contact with
police during the 12 months prior to their interview. Persons
who said they had a face-to-face contact during 2008 were
asked to describe the nature of the contact. Persons who had
more than one contact were asked about only their most
recent contact during the time period. Respondents were
provided a list of six specific reasons for having contact with
police: 1) traffic accident, 2) traffic stop, 3) reporting a crime,
4) police provided assistance, 5) police investigating crime,
and 6) the police suspected the resident of wrongdoing.
Respondents who reported having contact during a traffic
stop were asked whether they were the driver or passenger in
the vehicle. Drivers were asked an additional set of questions
about the reason for being pulled over and the actions
taken by police during the stop. A seventh category allowed
interviewers to record reasons that did not fall into any of
the six specific reasons. Among the 9,549 respondents who
had contact with police, 751 reported the reason for contact
under this nonspecific category.

Following the data collection, BJS examined these write-in
responses to determine if any descriptions fit one of the
six categories and, when possible, coded the field into an
existing category. This review uncovered 302 responses that
indicated the reason for contact was related to a traffic stop.
Some of these records lacked sufficient detail to determine
whether the respondent was a driver or passenger in a
vehicle that had been pulled over by police or was reporting
some other type of contact that was connected to a traffic
stop (e.g., paying a speeding ticket). Stopped drivers who
were not originally classified under the specific category
during the interview did not receive the additional questions
about the traffic stop.

To address this potential missing data issue, BJS instructed
the Census Bureau to conduct follow-up interviews with
122 of these respondents to seek clarification on the nature
of their contact with police. Ninety respondents agreed
to complete the follow-up interview. Of the completed
interviews, 79 respondents reported that their contact with
police occurred as a driver in a traffic stop and completed
the additional set of questions regarding the traffic stop.

Limitations of the estimates

BJS administers the PPCS questionnaire to all persons age
16 or older who reside in U.S. households sampled for the
NCVS. The PPCS excludes proxy interviews for a person
unable to participate because of physical, mental, or other
reasons. BJS staff determined that caregivers and other
proxy interviewees would have difficulty describing the
details of any contacts with police and decided to exclude
them. To the extent that persons who experience contacts
with police do not fall into this target population, the
PPCS data collection missed certain encounters between
the law enforcement officers and members of the public.
For instance, this household survey did not interview U.S.
residents living abroad, homeless persons, or persons living
in military barracks. The PPCS also did not interview
persons institutionalized (e.g., incarcerated in a correctional
facility) at the time of the interview about their encounters
with police during the 12-month reference period. Such
exclusions may affect the findings because contact with
police leading to incarceration would involve more serious
outomes (e.g., contacts involving an arrest or use of force by
police).

The BJS Survey of Inmates in Local Jails (SILJ) collects data
from a nationally representative sample of jail inmates on
a wide range of topics, including the specific types of force
police might have used or threatened to use during the arrest
that preceded the inmates' incarceration. An analysis of the
2002 SILJ and 2002 PPCS data found that the percentage of
inmates who experienced the use or threat of force at the
time of their arrest was about 22%, while the percentage
of PPCS respondents who had a contact with police that
involved force or the threat of force was about 1.5%.
*** Footnote 4 See Hickman, M., Piquero, A., & Garner, J.
 (2008).  Toward a national estimate of police use of 
nonlethal force.  Criminology & Public Policy.
*** When combining the PPCS and SILJ data, the 
overall estimated percentage of contacts that involved
the threat or use of force in 2002 was 1.7%.

This report describes the prevalence of public contact
with the police and the prevalence with which the contact
involves traffic stops, searches, and uses of force. It describes
the extent to which prevalence rates vary by some of the
categories of respondent characteristics or by the nature of
the contact. This information is collected and disseminated
to inform the public about the nature of interaction between
law enforcement officers and the public. However, the
data collected and described in this report cannot provide
a sufficient basis to infer a causal relationship between
characteristics of the respondent and behavior of police. This
limitation exists despite the descriptive statistics that seem to
show some differences (or no differences) in the prevalence
of contacts, stops, searches, or use of force in relationship to
the age, race, or sex of the respondent.

Conducting tests of statistical significance

Persons interviewed through the PPCS sample have a
known probability of selection, and their responses can
be used to produce national estimates of contacts between
police and the public. Since the estimates are based on a
sample of the population and not a complete enumeration,
these estimates are subject to sampling error (a discrepancy
between an estimate and a population parameter based on
chance). Sampling error varies by the size of the estimate in
relation to the size of the base population, and is reduced by
increasing the size of the sample taken from the population.

A standard error is a measure of the sampling error, or
the margin of error due to sampling, and can be used as a
measure of precision expected from a sample; the smaller
the standard error, the more precise or reliable the estimate.
Standard errors for selected tables are available at the end 
of this report.

In general, when comparing estimates between groups,
if the difference between two estimates is at least twice
the standard error of that difference, there is at least 95%
confidence that the two estimates actually differ. Thus, one
can conclude that there is a statistically significant difference
between the two groups.

All differences discussed in this report were statistically
significant at or above the 95% confidence interval unless
otherwise indicated. Some differences were not significant
at the 95% confidence level, but were significant at the 90%
level. The report also indicates that some comparisons were
not different, which meant that the difference between
the two estimates was not significant at either the 95% or
90% levels. In order to calculate the confidence intervals
for the estimated 16.9% of residents who had contact with
police in 2008, the calculated standard error of 0.3% was
used (appendix table 5). The 95% confidence interval
around this estimate was calculated as plus or minus
1.96 multiplied by 0.3% (or 16.3% to 17.6%). The 95%
confidence interval around the percentage of residents
who had contact in 2005 was 19.1% plus or minus 1.96
multiplied by 0.5% (or 18.2% to 20.1%). Statistical
significance tests found that the difference between these
two estimates was statistically significant at the 95%
confidence level. This means the apparent difference was
not simply the result of surveying a sample rather than the
entire population.

Significance testing calculations were conducted using
statistical programs developed specifically for the PPCS
by the U.S. Census Bureau. These programs take into
consideration the complex sample design of the PPCS 
when conducting tests of statistical significance.

Comparing estimates from the Police-Public Contact
Surveys

Certain comparisons were limited in this report to findings
from the 2002, 2005, and 2008 surveys for several reasons.
Changes were made to the data collection instrument
following the 1999 survey to reduce the overall response
burden to survey participants. These changes affected
estimates of the reasons for contact with police and
information on contacts that occurred while driving a
vehicle that was stopped by police. In 1999, respondents
were asked to identify the reasons for all of their contacts
with police during the previous 12 months and the
frequency of those contacts. In addition, any respondent
who had been pulled over in a traffic stop in the last year
was asked to describe the nature and outcome of the stop.
Following the 1999 survey, the data collection instrument
was changed so that respondents were only asked to provide
detailed information on their most recent contact with
police during the previous 12 months. Respondents whose
most recent face-to-face contact was not a traffic stop, but
who had been pulled over by police earlier in the year, were
not asked to describe that incident.

Following the 1999 survey, the measurement of the number
of drivers in the United States was also modified, making
the estimate of the likelihood of being stopped by police in
1999 is not directly comparable to estimates in 2002, 2005,
and 2008. The denominator used to calculate the likelihood
of being stopped by police was "licensed drivers" in 1999,
as estimated by the U.S. Department of Transportation's
1995 Nationwide Personal Transportation Survey. In 2002,
2005, and 2008, the denominator was "drivers in the United
States," as estimated directly from responses to additional
questions included in Police-Public Contact Surveys. The
denominator change was made to account for all persons
who drive, licensed and not licensed, to better approximate
the number of persons at risk of being stopped by police.
Excluded from the new denominator were licensed drivers
who indicated that they never drive.

A number of methodological changes were implemented in
the NCVS in 2006. Analyses of the survey data after 2006
indicated that the changes had a relatively small impact on
the estimates and that the 2008 estimates are comparable
with estimates for 2005. Information on the methodological
changes to the NCVS are available online at www.bjs.gov.

Some of the 2005 national estimates in this report differ
slightly from those shown in the BJS report Contacts between
Police and the Public, 2005. The weights for the 2005 PPCS
data were revised to reflect a slight change of the NCVS
person weights, which were the starting point for the PPCS
weights. For instance, the difference between the overall rate
of police-public contact from the 2005 report (19.09%) and
the revised rate (19.14%) was about 0.05%.
