In 2007, 2,330 state prosecutors' offices served state
judicial districts in the United States. The offices reported
a total estimated budget of $5.8 billion in 2007 and employed
nearly 78,000 attorneys, investigators, paralegals, and
support staff . State prosecutors closed 2.9 million cases
charged as felonies in state courts in 2007, approximately 94
cases for each prosecuting attorney on staff.

The 2007 Census of State Court Prosecutors marked the second
BJS survey of all prosecutors' offices in the United States.
Th e first census, conducted in 2001, included the 2,341
offices in operation at that time. The second census included
the 2,330 state court prosecutors' offices operating in 2007.
Neither census included offices of municipal attorneys or
county attorneys, who primarily operate in courts of limited
jurisdiction.

State court prosecutors serve in the executive branch of
state governments and handle felony cases in state courts of
general jurisdiction. By law, these prosecutors are afforded
broad discretion in determining who is charged with an
offense and whether a case goes to trial. The chief
prosecutor, also referred to as the district attorney, county
attorney, commonwealth attorney, or state's attorney,
represents the state in criminal cases and is answerable to
the public as an elected or appointed public official.

The Office of the United States Attorney for the District of
Columbia is the only federal prosecutor included in the
census. This unique office is responsible for prosecution of
serious local crimes committed in the District and also for
prosecution of federal cases, whether criminal or civil.
These tables describe the operational and administrative
functions of the offices that prosecute criminal offenses in
state courts, including felony caseloads, office budgets and
staffing, and prosecution of particular criminal offenses in
2007.

Summary findings

Populations served

* In 2007, 2,330 prosecutors' offices across the United
States served districts with populations ranging in size from
500 to 9.9 million residents (not shown in table).

* Most (74%) prosecutors' offices served districts with a
population of less than 100,000 residents. Fifteen percent
of prosecutors' offices were part-time offices with no full-
time chief prosecutor (table 1).

* State prosecutors' districts (85%) generally correspond
with county boundaries. Alaska, Delaware, Connecticut,
and Rhode Island had a single prosecutors' office for the
entire state (not shown in table).

Operating budgets and staffing levels

* The total operating budget ($5.8 billion) of state
prosecutors' offices in 2007 decreased by 5% from the $6.1
billion budget for 2001 (inflation-adjusted to 2007 dollars)
(not shown in table).

* The average operating budget for full-time prosecutors'
offices in 2007 ranged from $526,000 for those serving
fewer than 100,000 residents to $49.3 million in
jurisdictions serving more than 1 million. The average
part-time office's budget was $157,000 (table 2).

* State prosecutors' offices employed almost 78,000 full-time
equivalent (FTE) staff in 2007.*Footnote****Full-time
equivalent (FTE) is a computed statistic calculated by
dividing the total number of hours worked by part-time
employees by the standard number of hours for a full-time
employee (40 hours per week) and then adding the resulting
quotient to the number of full-time employees.***

* The nearly 25,000 FTE assistant prosecutors employed in
2007 represented a 7% increase from the number reported
in 2001 (not shown in table).

* Prosecutors' offices serving populations of 1 million or
more employed an average of 535 FTE staff, including 187
assistant prosecutors, 31 supervisory attorneys, 16 victim
advocates, 51 investigators, and 183 support staff.

* In full-time offices serving fewer than 100,000 residents,
on average, offices included one chief prosecutor, three
assistant prosecutors, one victim advocate, one legal
services staff, one investigator, and three support staff.

* Assistant prosecutors comprised 32% of the total staff
in prosecutors' offices in 2007. Support staff, including
administrative and clerical staff, accounted for 33% of the
total staff (table 3).

Felony cases processing and dispositions

* Prosecutors' offices reported closing 2.9 million cases
charged as felonies in 2007 through convictions, acquittals,
dismissals, or other dispositions (table 4).

* Offices in districts with more than 1 million residents
closed an average of 17,652 felony cases in 2007. Offices
serving jurisdictions with 250,000 to 999,999 residents
closed an average of 4,431 felony cases.

* In 2007, prosecuting attorneys in offices in districts with
100,000 to 249,999 residents closed an average of 121
felony cases each. The average caseload per prosecuting
attorney across all full-time offices was 94 felony cases.

* The budgeted cost per felony case closed, calculated as the
total office budget in 2007 divided by the number of felony
cases closed, was $2,792 in offices serving 1 million or
more residents.

* Prosecutors' offices reported 2.2 million convictions for
cases charged as felonies in 2007.

* Prosecutors' offices serving 1 million or more residents
had an average of 11,952 felony case convictions, while full-
time offices serving populations of less than 100,000 had
an average of 315 felony case convictions.

* Felony cases adjudicated through jury verdicts were rare
across state prosecutors' offices, accounting for an average
of 3% of all felony case dispositions and 2% of dispositions
litigated by offices serving 1 million or more residents.

Tenure and salary

* The average annual salary of a chief prosecutor in 2007
was $98,000, with mean salaries ranging from $165,700 for
chief prosecutors in the largest offices to less than $45,000
in part-time offices (table 5).

* In 2007, the average tenure of a chief prosecutor was
9 years.

* Sixty-four percent of chief prosecutors had been in office
for more than 5 years, and 38% had been in office for more
than 10 years. The longest serving prosecutor had been in
the position for 42 years.

* The average annual salary for assistant prosecutors ranged
from $33,460 for entry-level assistant prosecutors in part-
time offices to $108,434 for assistant prosecutors with 6 or
more years of experience in offices serving jurisdictions of
1 million or more residents (table 6)

* In offices serving 1 million or more residents, the average
assistant prosecutor's salary started at $51,354 for those
with no experience and at $73,010 for those with 6 years or
more experience, a difference of 42% (figure 1).

* In offices serving between 250,000 and 999,999 residents,
the average assistant prosecutor's salary started at $47,580
for those with no experience and at $65,400 for those with
6 years or more experience, a difference of 37%.

* In full-time offices serving less than 100,000 residents,
the average assistant prosecutor's salary started at $42,380
for those with no experience and at $53,113 for those with 6
years or more experience, a difference of 25%.

* In part-time offices the average assistant prosecutor's
salary started at $33,460 for those with no experience and
at $36,481 for those with 6 years or more experience, a
difference of 9%.

Threats against prosecutors' offices

* In 2007, almost half (47%) of prosecutors' offices had
received a written threat, a threatening phone call, a face-
to-face threat, or had staff who were victims of battery or
assault (table 7).

* About 26% of offices reported receiving written threats,
while 32% received threatening phone calls and 29%
received face-to-face verbal threats. About 3% of offices
reported that one of their staff had been a victim of battery
or assault.

* Most offices (89%) serving populations of 1 million or
more received a threat during 2007, as did most offices
(69%) in jurisdictions with 250,000 to 999,999 residents.

* More than two-thirds of offices serving populations
of 100,000 or more reported that the chief prosecutor,
an assistant prosecutor, or a staff investigator carried a
firearm.

* The percentage of offices reporting that a staff
investigator carried a firearm (34%) was greater than the
percentage reporting that the chief prosecutor (21%) or
assistant prosecutors (18%) carried one.

* The percentage of prosecutors' staff that reported carrying
firearms has remained steady since 2001.

* The majority (58%) of offices that had received a threat
reported that office staff carried a firearm, compared to
37% of offices that had not received a threat (not shown in
table).

Specific felony offenses

* In 2007, the majority of prosecutors' offices reported
prosecuting felony cases involving methamphetamine production
(71%), child exploitation involving the internet (58%), or
elder abuse (55%) (table 8).

Methodology

The 2007 National Census of State Court Prosecutors (NCSP-07)
included 2,330 chief prosecutors in the United States
that handled felony cases in state courts of general
jurisdiction. State court prosecutors serve districts
determined by each state's court structure.

Data collection. The Urban Institute collected the data on
behalf of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The
National District Attorneys Association helped review the
data collection instrument, provided their national directory
of district attorneys, and provided a medium for
advertisement via their bi-monthly publication, The
Prosecutor. The Urban Institute conducted the collection
through a mailed questionnaire and a web automated
instrument. The NCSP-07 form is available on the BJS website
at www.bjs.gov.

Response rates. The NCSP-07 had an overall response
rate of 95.6% from the 2,330 prosecutors' offices across the
nation. After the initial mailings, BJS followed up to obtain
a returned survey from each prosecutors' office. The
follow-up process involved phone calls, email, fax
communications, a second mailing of questionnaires, and
follow-up letters. Completed surveys were received from 1,303
(56%) prosecutors' offices. Follow-up telephone calls,
emails, and faxes resulted in an additional 924 (40%) offices
providing a sufficient partially completed form, to make a
final total of 2,227 responses from the eligible 2,330. A
total of 4.4% (103) of the offices either did not respond
(47) or directly refused participation (56). Among the 103
court prosecutors' offices that did not respond, 84% were in
districts that served populations of less than 250,000.

Calculated variables. Several variables were calculated
using reported and imputed data collected from the survey
instrument. 

* Full-time equivalent (FTE) is a computed statistic
calculated by dividing the total number of hours part-time
employees worked by the standard number of hours for a
full-time employee (40 hours per week), and then adding the
resulting quotient to the number of full-time employees. (See
U.S. Census Bureau Government Employment, 1997, at
http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/ meta/long_58632.htm.)

* Attorneys carrying a caseload (supervisory attorneys,
assistant prosecutors, and chief prosecutors) were included
as FTE prosecuting attorneys. Managing attorneys who did
not prosecute cases were excluded.

* Cases closed per prosecuting attorney was calculated for
each office by dividing the number of felony cases closed
by the office in 2007 by the number of FTE prosecuting
attorneys on staff in 2007.

* The budgeted cost per felony case closed was calculated for
each office by dividing the total office budget in 2007 by
the number of felony cases closed.

* The proportion of felony cases closed by jury verdict was
calculated for each office by dividing the number of felony
cases closed by jury verdict by the number of felony cases
closed in 2007.

Data Imputations

BJS used a combination of hot and cold deck approaches
to impute values for nine critical variables. These variables
included the number of chief prosecutors, number of
full-time assistant prosecutors, number of full-time staff,
number of part-time staff, annual salary of chief prosecutor,
total office operating budget, number of felony cases closed,
number of felony cases resulting in a conviction, and the
number of felony cases tried before a jury. Data were missing
for approximately 6% of all offices for staffing critical
variables, 16% of offices were missing budget information,
and 23% of offices were missing caseload information
(table 9).

The 2007 data file was merged with the 2001 Census of
State Court Prosecutors data file to allow imputation from
previously collected valid data from the same prosecutorial
office.

For each jurisdiction with valid 2001 and 2007 data, an
adjustment ratio was calculated as the ratio of the critical
variable's 2001 value to its 2007 value. All ratios greater
than the 90th percentile were discarded for imputation
purposes.

Where only 2001 data were available, a hot deck imputation
procedure was employed to impute the adjustment ratio
value from the jurisdiction's nearest neighbor in terms of
state and population size. Where there were no suitable
donors in the same state, a donor of similar population
size was used. The 2001 data were then adjusted using the
imputed adjustment ratio to create the imputed 2007 value
for the missing critical variable.

Adjusting for Inflation

Financial data for fiscal years preceding 2007 were inflation
adjusted using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflators
prepared by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The GDP
deflator chain-type price index, as appropriate for state and
local government salaries, was applied to 2001 prosecutors'
office salary data. The constant dollar salaries were then
used to impute 2007 salary data for offices that did not
provide salary data. (See table B-7, Chaintype price indexes
for gross domestic product, 1962-2010, Department of
Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis at
http://www.gpoaccess.gov/ eop/tables11.html for further
details.)
