Highlights

The National Crime Victimization Survey reveals 
that violent and property  crime rates in 2003 
did not change from the previous year

*  Though the downward trend in crime rates has
stabilized, violent and property crime rates in 
2004 remain at the lowest levels recorded since 
the survey's inception in 1973.

*  Rates for all major categories of nonlethal 
crime remained stable from 2003 to 2004.

*  The rate of violent crime dropped 9% from the 
period 2001-02 to the period 2003-04.

*  From 1993 to 2004 the rate for crimes of 
violence was down 57%, from 50 to 21 
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or older.

*  Reporting of crime to the police increased 
significantly from 1993 to 2004. Reporting rose 
from 42% to 50% of violent crimes and from 34% 
to 39% of property crimes. 

*  During 2004, 22% of all violent crime incidents 
were committed by an armed offender; 6%, by an 
offender with a firearm.

*  During 2004 males were about as vulnerable to
violence by strangers (50% of the violence against
males) as by nonstrangers (48%), while females were
most often victimized by nonstrangers (64%).

*  Between 2001-02 and 2003-04 violent crime
decreased 17% in the West, from 31 to 26 
victimizations per 1,000 persons age 12 or 
older.

*  Violent victimizations in urban areas fell 
14% from 2001-02 to 2003-04.

*  Based on preliminary 2004 data from the FBI, 
the number of persons murdered in the United 
States decreased 3.6% between 2003 and 2004.
----------------------------------------------

In 2004 U.S. residents age 12 or older experienced
an estimated 24 million violent and property 
victimizations, according to the National Crime 
Victimization Survey(NCVS). (See Survey methodology, 
page 11.) These criminal victimizations included an 
estimated 18.6 million property crimes (burglary, 
motor vehicle theft, and theft), 5.2 million 
violent crimes (rape, sexual assault, robbery,
aggravated assault, and simple assault), and 
224,000 personal thefts (pocket picking and purse 
snatching).

Victimization rates for every major type of crime
measured were unchanged from their 2003 levels. For
most crimes aggregated rates for the period 2003-04
were unchanged from those for 2001-02. However, for
overall crimes of violence aggregate rates for the 
period 2003-04 declined 9% from 2001-02. Individual
categories with observed marginal declines included
attempted and threatened violence, attempted rape,
completed robbery and simple assault. During this 
same period, a decline in rates of minor theft was 
also observed. Taken together, the 1-year (2003-04) 
and 2-year (2001-02 to 2003-04) change estimates 
indicate that crime rates remain stabilized at the 
lowest levels experienced since 1973. 

Between 1993 and 2004 the violent crime rate
decreased 57% from 50 to 21 victimizations per 
1,000 persons age 12 or older. Property crime 
declined 50% from 319 to 161 per 1,000 
households.

In 2004, according to victims, 50% of violent 
crimes and 39% of property crimes were reported 
to the police. The proportions of crime reported 
to the police has increased since 1993, when 
victims indicated that 43% of the violent crimes 
and 34% of the property crimes had been reported.

Criminal victimization, 2003-04

The NCVS collects data on nonfatal crimes against
persons age 12 or older, reported and not reported 
to the police, from a nationally representative 
sample of U.S. households. Information on homicide 
is obtained from the Uniform Crime Reporting
(UCR) program of the FBI.

Crimes measured by the NCVS

Violent crimes refer to rape/sexual assault, 
robbery, aggravated assault, and simple 
assault taken as a whole.

Property crimes refer to household burglary, 
motor vehicle theft, and theft considered 
together.

The violent and property crime rates remained 
stable, 2003-04, as did rates for individual 
types of crime. 

Murder/nonnegligent manslaughter

Based on preliminary 2004 data from the FBI, the
number of persons murdered in the United States
decreased 3.6% between 2003 and 2004. In 2003,
16,500 persons were murdered; the estimate for 
2004 is about 15,910 victims of murder. Based 
on these preliminary data, the homicide rate 
for 2004, is about 5.4 per 100,000. 

Preliminary data suggest that decreases in the 
number of murders occurred in the Northeast
(-3.1%), Midwest(-4.8%), and South(-5.5%).

An increase in the number of murders was measured 
in the West(+0.4%).

------------------------------------------------
Murder and victim characteristics, 2003

In 2003, the year for which the most recent
comprehensive data are available, the FBI 
reported a total of 16,500 murders or 
nonnegligent manslaughters. The total represents 
a 1.7% increase from the 16,230 murders recorded 
in 2002. The FBI defines murder in its annual 
Crime in the United States as the willful
(nonnegligent) killing of one human being by 
another. Not included are deaths caused by 
negligence, suicide, or accident; justifiable 
homicides; and attempts to murder or assaults. 
The FBI's UCR program gathers statistics on murder 
from over 17,000 city, county, and State law 
enforcement agencies.

Though the rate and level of homicide change year 
to year, the relationship between victim 
characteristics and homicide tends to remain the 
same. For example, as in previous years, in 2003 --

*  Most murder victims were male (78%).
*  When the race of the murder victim was known, 
about half were white (49%), and about half were 
black (49%). 
About 3% of murder victims were of another race.
*  When information on the victim/offender 
relationship was available, 78% of the offenders 
were known to the victim, while 22% were a 
stranger to the victim.
*  Firearms were used in the majority of murders 
(71%).
*  Offenders were most often male (90%), and most
often adults (92%).
*  Homicide is generally intraracial.
*  Arguments were the most often cited circumstance
leading to murder (29%).
*  Homicides occurred in connection with another 
felony (such as rape, robbery, or arson) in 16% 
of incidents.
-------------------------------------------------

Criminal victimization, 2001-02 and 2003-04

Comparing 2-year average annual rates shows 
that for several categories of crime the 
average annual rates were significantly 
lower in 2003-04 than in 2001-02.

-------------------------------------------
Estimating change in crime 
victimization rates

Since 1995, the NCVS has undergone sample
reductions because of the escalating costs 
of data collection. At the same time, the 
rate of violence has continued to decline. 
The combination of the two –- fewer survey 
respondents and less crime -- has resulted
in a diminished ability to detect 
statistically significant year-to-year 
changes in rates.

Comparing 2-year average rates gives the 
reader a picture of the continuing decline 
in rates seen over the last few years. For 
those who rely upon the annual detailed 
table of victimization counts and per capita
rates, those data are located on the BJS 
website at
<www.ojp. usdoj.gov/bjs/abstract/cv04.htm>.
-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------
Victimization rates as compared 
to victimization counts

The analyses in this report incorporate rates 
per 1,000 persons age 12 or older or per 1,000 
households. Using rates rather than counts 
takes into account the size of the population 
at risk for victimization. This allows for
accurate comparisons of groups of differing 
sizes as well as changes in populations over 
time. Ignoring these differences in populations 
(examining counts alone) can lead to erroneous 
conclusions about changes in vulnerability.
---------------------------------------------

The average annual overall violent victimization 
rate declined 9% from 24 to 22 victimizations 
per 1,000 persons per year, from 2001-02 to 
2003-04. During the same time rates of simple 
assault declined marginally. Overall property 
rates remained the same during the 2001-02 to 
2003-04 period; however, an 11% decline in
minor theft under $50 was observed over 
comparable years.

Characteristics of the crime victim, 
from 2001-02 to 2003-04

Violent crime

Violent crime rates for females dropped 15% 
from 2001-02 to 2003-04: from 22 to 19 
victimizations per 1,000 females. Apparent 
differences in the rates for males were not 
statistically significant. 

Rates of violence against persons who were 
widowed declined somewhat from 2001-02 to 
2003-04: from 7 to 4 victimizations per 1,000 
persons age 12 or older.

For persons age 65 years or older, violent 
crime rates fell significantly from 3 to 2 
victimizations per 1,000 persons. There was 
no significant change for persons of other 
age categories. 

Significant declines in the rates of violent 
victimization were observed for persons in 
households earning between $15,000 and $24,999 
and $35,000 and $49,999. A slight decline in 
violence was indicated for those in households 
earning between $25,000 and $34,999.

Between 2001-02 and 2003-04, violent crime 
decreased 17% in the West, from 31 to 26 
victimizations per 1,000 individuals. Rates 
of violent victimization did not change 
significantly in the Northeast, Midwest, and 
South. Significant declines in the rate of 
violent victimizations were noted for persons 
residing in urban areas.

Property crime

When considered by household income levels, no
significant change between 2001-02 and 2003-04 
was found in the vulnerability to property 
crime.

A marginal decline of 6% in property crimes was
measured in the West, from 2001-02 to 2003-04. 

Rates of property crime increased somewhat in 
rural areas, from 125 to 136 victimizations 
per 1,000 households.

From 2001-02 to 2003-04, average annual property
crime rates remained statistically similar for 
resident renters and homeowners.

-----------------------------------------------
Victimization trends, 1993-2004   

The rate of every major violent and property 
crime measured in the NCVS -- rape/sexual 
assault, robbery, aggravated assault, simple 
assault, burglary, theft, and motor vehicle 
theft -- fell significantly between 1993-2004.

Violent crime

The overall violent crime rate fell 57% from 50 
to 21 violent victimizations per 1,000 persons 
age 12 or older between 1993 and 2004. Other 
significant declines were measured in the rates 
of rape/ sexual assault (down 64%), robbery 
(down 65%), aggravated assault (down 64%), and 
simple assault (down 52%).  

Property crime

From 1993 through 2004 the rate of overall 
property crime declined as did the rate for 
each major type of property crime considered. 
The household burglary rate fell 49%; the 
motor vehicle theft rate fell 54%; and the
theft rate fell 49%.
------------------------------------------

Characteristics of victims, 1993-2004

While violence decreased for both males and 
females between 1993 and 2004, the rate for 
males in each year was higher than that for 
females. The rate of violence for males 
declined 58%, from 60 to 25 violent 
victimizations per 1,000. The rate of violence 
against females declined 56%, from 41 to 18 
victimizations per 1,000 individuals.

Changes in survey methodology prevent long-
term comparisons for race and ethnicity. See 
Survey methodology on page 11 for further 
details.

Violent crime rates declined 31% for victims 
residing in households earning $7,500 to 
$14,999, from 56 to 39 victimizations per 
1,000 individuals. Violent crime rates for 
individuals in all other income categories 
declined 50% or more. 

Property crime rates fell for every demographic 
group considered, 1993-2004. Property crime 
rates for households that owned their homes 
showed a decline of 50%, and rates for 
households of renters declined 48% over the 
period.

Between 1993 and 2004 households with an annual
income of less than $7,500 experienced smaller
declines in property crime rates than did 
households with annual incomes of $25,000 or 
more. Households with an annual income greater 
than $50,000 experienced larger drops in 
property crime rates than did households with 
lower annual incomes.

The rate of urban property crime declined 47%,
1993-2004. Property crime in rural areas 
decreased 46% during this period. Households 
in the suburbs experienced the greatest decline 
in property crime rates (53%) from 1993 to 2004.

Households in all regions of the country 
experienced decreases in property crime 
rates of at least 46%, 1993-2004. 

Characteristics of violent crime 
victims, 2004

Persons who have been historically the most 
vulnerable to violent victimization -- males 
and youths -- continued to be victimized at 
higher rates than others in 2004.

Gender of victim

Males were victims of overall violent crime, 
robbery, total assault, simple assault, and 
aggravated assault at rates higher than those 
of females. Females were more likely than 
males to be victims of rape/sexual assault.

Race of victim

Beginning in 2003 survey respondents were able 
to self-identify with more than one race. The 
racial categories presented in this report 
consist of the following: white only, black only, 
other race only (an American Indian/Alaska Native, 
Asian, or Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander 
identifying a single race), and two or more 
races (all persons indicating two or more races).

Persons of two or more races were victims of 
overall violence at significantly higher rates 
than those for whites, blacks, and persons of 
other races.

Blacks were victims of overall violence, robbery, 
and aggravated assault at rates higher than those 
for whites in 2004. Blacks and whites were equally 
likely to experience rape/sexual assault, simple 
assault, and theft in 2004. Blacks were also more 
likely than persons of other races to be victims 
of overall violence and simple assault.

Hispanic origin of victim

Non-Hispanics were victims of overall violence 
and simple assault at rates higher than those 
of Hispanics in 2004. Hispanics and non-
Hispanics were equally likely to experience 
rape/sexual assault, robbery, aggravated 
assault and theft.

Age of victim

During 2004, as in previous years, there was a 
general pattern of decreasing crime rates for 
persons of older age categories. Persons age 
12-19 experienced overall violence at rates 
higher than rates for persons age 25 or older. 
Persons age 16-19 and 20-24 experienced rape/
sexual assault, robbery, aggravated and simple 
assault at similar rates. Persons age 20-24 
were less likely than persons age 16-19 to be 
victims of personal theft.

Household income

During 2004 there was a general pattern of 
decreasing victimization rates for persons 
residing in households with higher incomes. 
Persons in households with an annual income 
under $7,500 were more likely to be victims 
of robbery and assault than members of
households with incomes greater than $25,000.

Individuals in households earning less than 
$15,000 annually were victims of assault at a 
significantly higher rate than those of persons 
in households at higher income levels. Members 
in households earning $15,000 to $24,999 and 
$25,000 to $34,999 experienced rape/sexual 
assault at similar rates. Persons residing in 
households earning more than $75,000 were 
victims of violent crime at significantly 
lower rates than those of persons in households 
earning less.

Marital status

During 2004 persons who were never married or
divorced/separated experienced statistically 
similar rates of rape, robbery, and aggravated 
assault. Persons who were never married 
experienced overall violent victimization at 
rates higher than those for married, widowed, 
or divorced/ separated persons.

Region

In 2004 residents in the Northeast experienced 
the lowest rates of overall violent victimization. 
Rates of overall violent victimization were the 
same in the Midwest and West. Persons residing in 
the Northeast and Midwest were equally likely to 
experience robbery while residents in Northeast 
experienced higher rates of robbery than persons 
living in the South.
 
Residence

Urban residents were victimized at rates higher 
than those for suburban and rural residents 
during 2004. Except for rape/sexual assault, 
suburban and rural residents were victims of 
violence at statistically similar rates during 
2004.

Characteristics of victims of 
property crime, 2004

Annual household income

No clear pattern in overall property crime rates 
was evident in 2004. The relationship between 
income and crime rates did vary for specific 
types of property crime. 

Households with an annual income below $7,500 
were burglarized at rates higher than those of 
households with larger incomes. Households with 
an annual income below $7,500 and households 
with an annual income of greater than $75,000 
experienced motor vehicle theft at statistically 
similar rates. No significant differences in the 
rates of household theft were observed.

Region, locality, and home ownership

Rates of overall property crime were highest for
households in the West and lowest for households 
in the Northeast in 2004. For households located 
in the South and Midwest, the rates of overall 
property crime were statistically similar. 

Northeastern households were less likely to be
burglarized than households in other regions. The 
rate of burglary was lower in the West than in 
the Midwest and South. No difference in burglary 
rates was observed between the Midwest and the South.
Western households were most likely and Northeastern
households were the least likely to experience motor
vehicle theft in 2004. Rates of household theft were
highest in the West and lowest in the Northeast.

Rates of property crime were highest for households
located in urban areas, 2004. Rates of burglary were
higher for rural households than suburban households
but lower than rates of burglary in urban areas.

In 2004 households that rented were more likely than
households that owned their homes to experience all
types of property crime. 

Characteristics of the crime incident

Victim-offender relationship 
in violent crimes 

Females were most often victimized by someone 
they knew while males were equally likely to 
be victimized by a stranger or nonstranger 
during 2004.

Of those offenders victimizing females, 21% were
described as intimates and 34% as strangers. By
contrast, of those offenders victimizing males, 
4% were described as intimates and 50% as 
strangers.

For women, rape was most likely to be committed 
by a friend or acquaintance. Robbery was the 
crime most likely to be committed by a stranger 
for both males and females. A third of aggravated 
assaults were committed by a friend or 
acquaintance for both males and females.

Presence of weapons in violent crimes

During 2004 armed offenders committed 22% of all
violent crime incidents. The presence of a weapon
during a violent crime was related to the type 
of crime.  For example, rape and sexual assault 
incidents (8%) were less likely than robberies 
(46%) to be committed by an armed offender. 

The type of weapon also varied by the type of 
violence. Nineteen percent of robbery incidents 
occurred with a firearm present, compared to 5% 
of assault incidents. The rate of firearm 
violence declined significantly between 1993 
and 2004 from 5.9 to 1.4 victimizations per 
1,000 persons age 12 or older.

Reporting to the police

During 2004, 50% of all violent victimizations 
and 39% of all property crimes were reported to 
the police. The percentage of violent crime 
reported differed among the specific types of 
crime. Robbery (61%) and aggravated assault 
(64%) were most frequently reported to police.
Thirty-six percent of victims who experienced
rape/sexual assault and 45% of the victims 
experiencing simple assault indicated that their 
victimization had been reported to the police. 
Motor vehicle theft continued to be the property 
crime most frequently reported to the police 
(85%).

Fifty-three percent of burglaries and 32% of 
household thefts were reported to the police 
in 2004.

Reporting and victim characteristics

In 2004 females were more likely than males to 
report violent victimizations to the police. 
Both males and females were equally likely 
to report property victimizations to the 
police.

Rates of reporting for violent victimizations 
did not differ for males across racial 
categories. Female victims who were black or 
of other races were more likely to report
violent victimization to the police than were 
white females. 

Non-Hispanic and Hispanic males were equally 
likely to report victimizations to the police. 
Among females, Hispanics were more likely than 
non-Hispanics to report a violent crime. In 
contrast, non-Hispanic females were more 
likely than Hispanic females to report a 
property crime.

Reporting crime to the police, 
1993-2004

Overall reporting of violent and property crime 
increased significantly from 1993 to 2004.

Reporting for violent crime remained the same 
between 2003 and 2004. 

Reporting of burglary to police (from 50% in 
1993 to 53% in 2004) remained statistically 
similar from 1993 to 2004. Increases in the 
reporting of theft from 1993 to 2004, 26% to 
32%, were statistically significant. 

Survey methodology

This Bulletin presents data on nonlethal violence 
and property crimes from the National Crime 
Victimization Survey (NCVS), and data on homicide 
from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting program. 
In 2004, 84,360 households and 149,000 individuals 
age 12 or older were interviewed. For the 2004 
NCVS data presented here, the response rate was 
91.3% of eligible households and 85.5% of eligible 
individuals.

In 1997 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
introduced new guidelines for the collection and
reporting of race and ethnicity data in government
surveys. These methodological changes were
implemented for all demographic surveys as of 
January 1, 2003. Individuals are now allowed to 
choose more than one racial category. In prior 
years they were asked to select a single primary 
race.

Racial categories presented in this report now 
consist of the following: white only, black only, 
other race only (American Indian/Alaska Native, 
Asian, or Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander 
if only one of these races is given), and two 
or more races (all persons of any race 
indicating two or more races). 

Individuals are now asked whether they are of 
Hispanic ethnicity before being asked about 
their race, and are now asked directly if they 
are Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino.

Standard error computations

Comparisons of percentages and rates made in 
this report were tested to determine if observed 
differences were statistically significant. 
Differences described as higher, lower, or 
different passed a hypothesis test at the 0.05 
level of statistical significance (95% confidence
level). The tested difference was greater than 
twice the standard error of that difference. For 
comparisons that were statistically significant 
at the 0.10 level (90% confidence level), 
"somewhat," "slightly," "marginally," or "there 
is some indication that" is used to denote the
nature of the difference. Caution is required 
when comparing estimates not explicitly discussed 
in this Bulletin.
